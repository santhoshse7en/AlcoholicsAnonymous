Every university 'needs' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,Alcoholics Anonymous says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.,,2018-07-31 16:54:32+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said. Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase. NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff Universitys sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference. One student said the help she received turned her life around. Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge. At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course. She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly. ""I wasnt concentrating in meetings, I couldnt focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions."" ""I wasnt turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts."" The latest official data suggest young people are drinking less. However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up. ""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA. ""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and Im sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group."" Image caption The weekly AA meeting at Cardiff Universitys student union is for anyone who wants to stop drinking. Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"". Jennifer Kent, a vice president at the union, said: ""For us it feels like a really good way of integrating the students and the community here, and its also important that, by bringing it here, the students dont feel stigmatised.""

What happens in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?,"Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?",,10 June 2010,BBC News,"Image caption The true nature of alcoholism is a controversial subject Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the groups meetings? David looks, in a word, respectable. Bespectacled, and in a polo shirt and khaki shorts, he could be any respectable middle-aged man. He sits in a circle of other respectable-looking people in a church hall in a well-to-do part of Washington. Without knowing the context, as he prepares to speak, one might guess that this was a heritage group, ready to save a historic warehouse, or a meeting of concerned residents, demanding traffic-calming measures. Instead, when David opens his mouth, he starts to talk about his first use of drugs at the age of 12. Later he talks about his conscious decision to drink himself to death. Easy eloquence There is the revelation of small-time drug smuggling trips to South America and a life of profound lows. But he has an easy eloquence. ""I have fond memories of the moronic quality of being drunk,"" he says. People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad - in AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless Jack Trimpey , Rational Recovery ""My story is getting far away mentally. It is almost like the Peloponnesian War now."" The others in the group also speak enthusiastically, talking of trials and tribulations, of their relationship to drink and how they came to be part of AA. One gum-chewing, room-dominating woman contrasts life as a high-powered sober Washingtonian with her previous pre-AA life in a series of expansive arm gestures. Another man quietly and movingly recounts his sons troubles with the law. Its impossible to say whether these individuals were always raconteurs or whether their storytelling matured as they took the 12 Steps. Higher power Certain lines provoke laughter in the group. ""The only thing I knew for sure about my problem was it wasnt a drinking problem,"" deadpans one man. ""I knew you had to drink too much to have a drinking problem and I could never drink enough."" Image caption The AA dates its foundation to its co-founders last drink There are other phrases that are reverentially repeated. Life became ""unmanageable"" and a ""higher power"" has been at work. A 70-year-old salesman talks about a life where money was made in computers but years were lost to vodka. A woman talks of her travels and a reassuring fact. ""There are rooms like this all over the world where crazy people get to talk."" Of the 11 men and three women in the room, eight have been sober for more than 20 years. And their meeting is in a long tradition that stretches back to 10 June 1935, to the day Robert Smith - better known as Dr Bob - had his last drink. He had been working with AA co-founder Bill Wilson, now usually referred to as Bill W. Fictional depictions The organisation they created has helped millions give up drinking and rebuild their lives. And the meetings, with the 12-Step Programme that is at the heart of AA, are familiar even to those who have had nothing to do with the group. The higher power is not just the god of your understanding it is the people in the room Stan, Recovering alcoholic Countless depictions on film and television have familiarised people with what goes on at the meetings and the familiar formulation ""Im X and Im an alcoholic"". The organisation has its critics. There are those who disagree with the founding idea that alcoholism is a disease, a compulsion that the individual can do nothing about. Others dislike the Christian nature of the group. The 12 Steps talk of God ""as you understood him"". Jack Trimpey, who runs his own programme Rational Recovery, is a trenchant critic. ""We do object that it is a bad religion, one in which people profess powerlessness against their bodily desires. We are not powerless. We have a moral duty to cease and desist once it is shown. ""It has been a massive inversion of public thinking that has entered the mainstream media. ""People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad. In AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless."" He prefers to call himself a former ""bad drunk"" and speaks of an alternative approach that calls for ""zero tolerance in the family"". Having been sober for many year, he dislikes the typical AA attitude towards that. ""Its not an accomplishment - common decency is no accomplishment."" Image caption Concerns about binge drinking are now common to much of the world But for the people at the AA meetings, common decency - and everything else good in life - is an accomplishment. Jonathan speaks of the single day in 1987 when he first had a moment of happiness. And he knows how it must be maintained. ""I pray and I meditate, and I couple that with working with other alcoholics."" People at the group seem to have no problem with the varied application of the religious element of AA. There are atheist and agnostic groups, but its hard to get away from the references to God in the 12 Steps that are at the heart of AA. The softly-spoken Stan explains: ""The higher power is not just the god of your understanding, it is the people in the room."" And those other people are the key, one woman admits. ""It works because everything I attempted to do about drinking by myself never worked. ""By coming into AA I was able to get support to not drink - people who think exactly like me, that common bond.""

The many groups that have copied Alcoholics Anonymous,Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion.,,9 June 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright Other Image caption An AA meeting depicted on the Sopranos Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion, writes Chris Stokel-Walker. ""My name is Peter and Im an alcoholic."" Its a familiar phrase even to those who have never attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. When Peter introduces himself to 40 others in a small room just off Newcastles main shopping thoroughfare, on a sunny Saturday morning, he receives a warm welcome back in unison. Everyone here shares a drink dependency, though they come from hugely different walks of life. The format of the meeting is simple - an introduction, a reading, one member explaining their story, then a free-for-all discussion for others to share their concerns, their triumphs, and their thoughts. Peter began to drink at the age of 11. ""By the age of legal drinking in the UK I was being admitted to local alcoholic units; in and out of doctors; in and out of police cells. Everything in my life really deteriorated."" But Peter hasnt tasted alcohol in 34 years, and he attributes his sobriety to Alcoholics Anonymous. All members talk about ""working through the 12 steps"" that form the cornerstone of the programme. The first of the steps, published four years after AA began, reads: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable."" The 12 steps outline a plan of recovery to overcome addiction, which involves submitting to a higher spiritual power and admitting that alcoholism is an ongoing problem. Founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA grew out of a Christian organisation - the Oxford Group. Image copyright ALAMY Image caption The 12-step recovery programme for Narcotics Anonymous are the same for AA The group is marking 80 years from the moment Wilson helped Smith - 10 June 1935 was the latters last drink. That social element of AA, the importance of ""sponsors"" in the process, is as well known as any of the steps. Today, there are 115,326 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 175 different countries, according to the groups latest estimates, with more than two million members. There are 60,143 groups in the United States alone. According to a study in 1998, 90% of private substance abuse treatment centres based in the US model their treatment on the 12 steps. The principles have provided a basis for other 12-steps groups with no affiliation to mainstream AA. THE 12 STEPS We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs Source: Alcoholics Anonymous Great Britain These include Narcotics Anonymous, the more specific Marijuana Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. Clutterers Anonymous deals with those with hoarding problems. Underearners Anonymous offers support for those suffering an ""inability to provide for ones needs"". Support for loved ones of those going through addiction is on offer at Families Anonymous. On Monday alone there were four Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Manchester, a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in Fitzrovia, central London, and an Overeaters Anonymous session in Cannock. For some of the smaller groups, if theres no dedicated meeting available, addicts are advised to go to AA as a substitute. Across England, Wales and Scotland, 687 different Alcoholics Anonymous meetings took place on Monday, with 113 chapters coming together in London alone. ""If you look at any 12-step programme, the only significant difference really is the first part of the first step,"" says Peter, who attends AA meetings and organises Emotions Anonymous meetings in the North East of England. The latter group deals with issues as diverse as low self-esteem, resentment, fear, anger, indecision, perfectionism, forgiveness, depression, grief, shame and anxiety. ""I think theres a fellowship for every particular human condition,"" Peter jokes. ""But I can understand that, because apart from the first part of the first step, the rest of the programme is a programme for living."" Image copyright Other Image caption AA meeting depicted in the House of Cards Most fellowships offer Skype sessions, where youll be greeted in the same way, any hour of the day by welcoming peers always happy to listen, and youll say the same words: ""My name is… and Im addicted to …"" ""The 12 steps are very applicable to any other addiction,"" says Amy Krentzman of the University of Minnesotas School of Social Work, who has conducted research into Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes. ""They modify the language, but its the same basic programme, the same basic steps, and other people have got well from following them."" The ""helper"" theory, first coined in the 1960s, helps explain AAs efficacy, says Krentzman. The helper ends up feeling better too. Most, if not all, of those running 12-step groups are themselves undergoing treatment for addiction. In countless movies and TV shows - from the Sopranos to Mad Men to House of Cards to the West Wing - the sponsor-addict relationship crops up. Sponsors act as a spiritual, emotional and practical guide. Treatment is always ongoing in AA, unlike some other traditional rehabilitation programmes which offer short programmes followed by the addict coping largely alone. Marijuana Anonymous has ""exactly the same format"", explains Thomas, a member. ""It has the 12 steps, and various stories that illustrate the practical application of those steps, and stories from people who have gone through the experience and gone sober."" These spin-off groups are not explicitly endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), which oversees the organisations copyrights. But AAWS does grant permission for groups to use the 12 steps. Image copyright Alamy And AAs principles are still regularly criticised. Some dislike the quasi-religious element, others the emphasis on complete abstinence rather than the possibility of moderate consumption. Theres also a new film - The 13th Step - about sexual assaults carried out by AA members on other members. But perhaps the greatest criticism is from those who want concrete evidence that this widely accepted programme actually produces results. ""The evidence is that it works very well for some people,"" says Krentzman. A review of scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous success in aiding sobriety in 2006 found that ""no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"". Dr Lance Dodes, a former substance abuse treatment specialist, wrote in a book about 12-step programmes that: ""Alcoholics Anonymous was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over 75 years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approachs efficacy, and we have been on the wrong path ever since."" Another bone of contention is that porting across the 12-step programme to other areas offers cultural legitimacy to the idea of a wide range of compulsions as addictive diseases. Scientists continue to be divided over whether food addiction really exists. They are torn as to whether sex addiction is real or not. It does not, for example, appear in the American Psychiatric Associations list of mental disorders. But for many, the programme is effective. Krentzman notes: ""It works because of a psychological process, a social process, a spiritual process. Because of the way it gives people a sense of community and knowing other people who have the same problem."" Thats something Jennifer, who attends Overeaters Anonymous, agrees with. She joined the group in 2008, when she was 37 years old and 17-and-a-half stone. Today, she is at a more manageable weight, and attributes that to her ongoing relationship with the fellowship of overeaters. ""When Id been to therapists and they were telling me to try things, they had no experience of it themselves,"" she says. ""Theres something about one addict helping another addict. There was an authenticity to what they were saying."" ""Its a very simple programme for complicated people,"" Thomas says, ""and it seems to withstand a lot of questioning from outside and within, which cant be said for a lot of rehab philosophies."" In the AA meeting in Newcastle, 40 people sit and share stories of addiction. Aftewards, there are firm handshakes and friendly conversations - smiles and shared jokes. One by one, they file out the door into the crowds toting shopping bags, looking like anyone else. But in their mind, they carry an extra weight with them throughout the week.

Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?,"Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism?",,8 January 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright Thinkstock Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism? Should there be a word that bridges the gap between alcoholic and non-alcoholic? The term alcoholic - on its own to denote someone addicted to alcohol - was first used in 1852 in the Scottish Temperance Review. Since then, millions of heavy drinkers have been confronted by friends and families with the stark question: ""Are you an alcoholic?"" And millions have denied it. Rejected the label. Confessed only to maybe, possibly drinking too much. But utterly denied the A-word. Alcoholics are people who fall asleep in skips. Alcoholics get into fights. Alcoholics start the day with a shot of whisky. Alcoholics are drunk all the time. Alcoholics cant hold down jobs. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scottish clergyman Rev Thomas Guthrie (centre), an advocate of temperance None of the above is necessarily true, but the intensely negative nature of the word alcoholic leaves some people scrabbling for an alternative. ""There is so much stigma,"" says Kate, author of the blog The Sober Journalist. People are so frightened of it - their head fills with images of men drinking under bridges. ""There is this huge number of people out there who dont fit that stereotype but perhaps their drinking isnt quite normal."" Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences You look forward to drinking. You drink alone. You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms. You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking Kate went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when she started to think she was drinking too much, about four or five years ago. ""I felt I was out of place, I wasnt alcoholic enough. I felt that everyone else had worse problems with drinking than I did,"" she says. There are other words for people who drink a lot. There is everything from the lightly derogatory ""lush"" to the more flowery ""bibulous"" to the prosaic ""heavy drinker"". But there is nothing as succinct as alcoholic. And some believe that this gap has an effect. Professionals have started using other terms that would not be as negative as alcoholic because ""many doctors feel that it is quite difficult to engage a patient if you talk to them about alcoholism"", says Dr Sarah Jarvis, a consultant for Patient.co.uk. People have such vivid mental images of what it means to be an alcoholic that they measure themselves against that standard and do not seek help. ""They all have an idea of what an alcohol or problem drinker is but there is a different pattern for every drinker,"" Jarvis says. Not all experts share this view, however. Theres a danger that avoiding the term ""alcoholism"" will only serve ""to reassure people their drinking is OK when it isnt"", says Moira Plant, emeritus professor of alcohol studies at the University of the West of England. Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption The term inebriate was popular in the 19th Century She agrees the widespread impression of the alcoholic as a vagrant or street-drinker prevents higher-functioning people with drink problems from seeking help. But she says the best way to tackle this is to correct false stereotypes, not downplay the situation faced by such individuals - many of whom are already in denial. ""People normalise heavy drinking,"" she says. ""They tend to overestimate what everyone else drinks. They say, I dont drink as much as my friends so its OK."" There have been other words to describe someone drinking too much. In the 19th Century ""inebriate"" was a popular term and the word ""drunkard"" goes all the way back to the 15th Century. Englands Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day. But drinking above these recommendations does not necessarily mean that the person is an alcoholic. It just means increased risk of health damage. ""An alcoholic is anyone who is dependent on alcohol and who is drinking to a level that will endanger their health,"" Dr Jarvis says. The term alcoholic is very much alive in the vocabulary of ordinary people, says Tim Leighton, director of professional education and research at Action on Addiction. ""In Europe and in the UK, there was a move away from the term in the 1960s; it was seen as derogatory. We now talk about alcohol dependence, but you dont hear people in the street saying he is an alcohol dependent, they say he is an alcoholic,"" he says. Dr Jarvis says it is a shame the words ""hazardous"" or ""harmful"" drinker arent used more widely. The issue with the use of the word ""alcoholic"" is that it is narrow. ""You are either one or you are not,"" Leighton says. ""This is why some people prefer the term alcohol dependence. You can be an alcoholic without drinking too much - it is all about dependence, about losing control."" For a long time, it was a strict category, there were specific criteria and if you fulfilled these criteria, you were an alcoholic, says Joseph Nowinski, one of the authors of the book Almost Alcoholic. This is a stage for a lot of controversy - as long as you didnt meet the alcoholic criteria, you would say, ""I am not an alcoholic so I dont have a drinking problem"", he says. ""There has never been a word for people who come to the point of asking themselves the question, Do I have a problem or not?"" Based on this, Nowinski and Robert Doyle came up with the concept of being an ""almost alcoholic"" to describe people who are not alcoholics but who ""fall into a grey area of problem drinking"". ""The almost alcoholic zone is actually quite large. The people who occupy it are not alcoholics. Rather, they are men and women whose drinking habits range from barely qualifying as almost alcoholics to those whose drinking borders on abuse,"" they wrote in the Atlantic. ""An expanded view of drinking behaviour in terms of a spectrum as opposed to discrete categories might be viewed by some as opening the door to over-diagnosing the associated problems. We believe the opposite will prove to be the case: that this paradigm shift will allow people to recognise problems earlier and to seek solutions without having to be labelled as alcoholics."" ""There is a huge range of alcohol problems,"" Leighton says. ""A lot of people with alcohol problems are not alcoholics."" Until a new label is popularised there will be people who struggle to admit they have a problem, he says. But for Kate, the existing term has come to make sense as her recovery has progressed. ""I feel that eight months ago I wouldnt have said that I was an alcoholic and now I could say I am because I know what it means,"" she says.

Inside an anonymous support group for the children of alcoholics,"Newsbeat has been given rare access to an anonymous support group, Alateen, for children with alcoholic parents.",,None,,"Newsbeat has been given rare access to an anonymous support group, Alateen, for children with alcoholic parents. Self consciousness, feeling alone and feeling different are whats being discussed and could just be considered being part of being a teenager. But where as most 16-year-olds will have the support of a parent to get them through, these teenagers dont. Its estimated there a 2.6 million people across the UK dealing with alcoholic parents. ""Other people - they can go home and talk to their parents, who can help them,"" some of the groups members tell Newsbeat. ""But if we have a problem and [our parents] have been drinking theyre not going to be fully there for us. ""They might be aggressive, they might be silent, they might not want to talk to us at all."" Were gathered in a small room above a church hall. Its cold so weve all kept our coats on. Here people discuss the feelings most of us have learned to hide. Whoever is holding a Little Miss Chatterbox soft toy gets to talk. Everyones head nods when the topic of fake smiles comes up. ""I try not to fake smile any more,"" someone says. ""Its exhausting. It happens because Im afraid other people wont understand."" ""Its been a bad week emotionally for me,"" someone else says. ""More things happened with my dad and brother."" I get the feeling this is an update on something everyone here knows all about. As Little Miss Chatterbox continues to be passed around we hear how ""my step-mom is still a bitch"" and ""I feel like Ive lost my mum"". But no-one seems shocked. Although theyve all had different experiences, they share common emotions. Sadness is one of the main topics of this weeks meeting - the other is peace of mind. (We discuss sadness first because its good to finish on the more positive topic, someone says.) One girl explains how shes still battling depression. In fact, shes adamant she ""wouldnt still be here"" were it not for Alateen meetings. Just like Alcoholics Anonymous, which helps alcoholics recover, Alateen thrives on anonymity. It makes people feel safe. Theres an echo of chatter coming from another meeting downstairs. That meeting is an Al-Anon meeting, which helps slightly older relatives of alcoholics. Alcoholism ""is a family disease because it affects all the members emotionally and sometimes physically,"" according to a page of instructions read out at the start of each meeting. The group is also reminded weekly that ""everything that is said here must be held in confidence."" As I watch the group interact its clear to me they trust each other totally. They also seem to genuinely like each other - there are jokes and as someone wells up, shes given a hug. Suddenly, Little Miss Chatterbox is placed in front of me. I thought Id only be watching this evening but I get the feeling if I refuse to take part Ill somehow ruin the atmosphere. So I share my thoughts of sadness and Im surprised by how it feels. The group listen to me intently. I dont get the feeling they are faking an interest or just being polite. For a moment I forget about the job Im here to do and open up. Its a nice feeling - a mixture of nerves, adrenaline and feeling special. As I talk I spot a card on the table in front of me. Its the Alcoholics Anonymous ""serenity prayer"". God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference. ""Although we cannot change or control our parents, we can detach from their problems while continuing to love them,"" which is another quote from the groups instructions. Its almost half nine, the meeting has run over a little (mainly because of my questions) and instead of feeling tired, Im feeling uplifted. Lynne who organises the group gives me a hug goodbye. I think its a sign of how emotional everyone is. I take out my phone and call a friend but I struggle to explain how Im feeling. Perhaps thats the power of these groups, you have to go to understand.

"Could you be a workaholic, addicted to your job?","Most of us like to be a diligent worker, but what if you are actually addicted to your job?",,4 April 2018,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could working too hard and for too many hours be a form of addiction? ""My name is JC and I am a workaholic."" JC, who lives in Tampa Bay, Florida, says she needed a lot of courage the first time she stood up and said that in front of a group of people she had never met before. JC, who doesnt want us to reveal her full name, had gone along to a meeting of Workaholics Anonymous because she felt she couldnt cope anymore. A 40-year-old healthcare worker, who had conquered her alcoholism and an eating disorder, she says she couldnt experience the serenity that she hoped sobriety would bring because she instead had become addicted to working. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For many people securing a decent work/life balance is a tricky business ""I was constantly obsessed with work,"" she says. ""I realised I used work to numb out and avoid myself, my feelings and my fears."" Her work addiction and the stress that came with it affected her health. ""I had premature grey hair within three months of starting a management position,"" she says. ""I experienced adrenal fatigue... I have a heart condition."" Following a similar 12-step recovery plan to the one first devised by Alcoholics Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous started in the US in the early 1980s. Today there are more than 100 meeting groups around the world, from Argentina to the US, the UK and Japan. There is also the possibility of joining an online meeting via Skype or over the phone. But how do you know if you are a workaholic? And what other ways are there to get help? Wilmar Schaufeli, a professor of work and organisational psychology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, describes a workaholic as ""a person who works obsessively hard in a compulsive way"". Image copyright Jord Visser Image caption Wilmar Schaufeli says that Workaholics Anonymous works for many suffers, because they can realise they are not alone ""So its a combination between excessive work and compulsive work, compulsive tendency."" He adds that going to Workaholics Anonymous works for many sufferers because ""you see people who have the same problem, so you are not alone. I think this is an important thing for all kinds of behavioural problems or addictions."" For other people with work addiction problems, having one-to-one therapy with a trained professional might be the answer. But what actually can lead to work addition? Dr Claudia Herbert, a clinical psychologist at the Oxford Development Centre, in Putney, Oxfordshire, often treats sufferers. She says that many workaholics have other mental health disorders. ""Lots of clients may feel depressed, they may actually think that life is a little bit empty, they may have anxiety problems, they may also have addictions to cope with."" Image copyright Claudia Herbert Image caption Claudia Herbert says that many workaholics have other mental health problems The condition can be triggered by someone having to work too hard in the first place. ""People often have to take jobs that in previous times would have been done by two or three people,"" she says. Work addiction may be caused in part by a person being pushed too hard by his or her parents in their earlier life. ""People who as children were reinforced by their achievements rather than who they are, they are more likely to become work addicted,"" she adds. When it comes to the types of jobs where people are more vulnerable to becoming workaholics, Prof Schaufeli says it is more a case of senior professionals rather than those with jobs on the lower rungs of the workplace ladder. He says that self-employed people are also vulnerable because they can become obsessed by their businesses. Prof Schaufeli adds that work addicts very often dont see that their behaviour is problematic because the fact they are doing vast amounts of work often means they are earning more and being promoted. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some workaholics are not said to recognise that anything is wrong because they have secured promotions and pay rises When it comes to treating work addiction, Dr Herbert says it needs to be individually tailored to each sufferer, and getting to the bottom of what caused it. At Retreat South, a rehabilitation centre and mental health retreat in the Australian state of Victoria, they run a work-related stress and executive burnout programme, trying to get peoples work/life balance back. The programme started six years ago, and the average length of stay is one month, with prices from 8,000 Australian dollars ($6,100; £4,400) per week. Most of the clients are Australian, but they also have some from Asia and Europe.

The Spiritual Approach To Addiction,"The Spiritual Approach To Addiction - Programmes to help drug and alcohol addicts abstain from addictive substances are more effective if they have a 'spiritual component', according to researchers in the United States.",,None,,"Front Page WORLD News Sport Business Entertainment Science/Nature Technology Talking Point In Depth ------------- Learning English Programmes Schedules & Frequencies Site Map REGIONS Africa Americas Asia-Pacific Europe Middle East South Asia SERVICES About Us Contact Us Help Text Only Daily E-mail News Ticker Mobile/PDAs You are in: Front Page > Science and Technology Wednesday 16 May, 2001 The Spiritual Approach To Addiction Programmes to help drug and alcohol addicts abstain from addictive substances are more effective if they have a spiritual component, according to researchers in the United States. A study of how recovering addicts fared a year after treatment has found that spiritual programmes, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, were more effective than treatment in a hospital clinic. BBC Science reports. Recovery Programmes Addiction recovery programmes like Alcoholics Anonymous emphasise a spiritual approach to recovery from addiction. The Stanford University study found that recovering addicts were more likely to abstain from drugs and alcohol if they were attending a spiritually oriented programme, like Alcoholics Anonymous, than if they were attending a hospital outpatients clinic. Spiritual And Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded in the 1930s, and its 12-step programme encourages members to turn to God or a Higher Power for help in overcoming addiction. Whilst the group does not keep official membership lists, it estimates that there are currently 99,020 groups in operation across the world, with a total membership of 1,995,804. Clinical treatment, on the other hand, emphasises cognitive skills training and psychotherapy. With a scientific focus, patients rely more heavily on professional counselling services that are likely to deal with teaching people how to deal with situations that may lead to drinking and how to cope with the negativity of alcoholism. The study found that people attending meetings styled on the AA approach were more likely to be abstaining from drugs or alcohol a year after first seeking help, compared to addicts who were given clinical treatment. Dr Keith Humphreys, professor of psychiatry at The Stanford University School of Medicine, California, and leader of the research, says spiritual programmes have been widely criticised for not being based on medical science. But, he says, these programmes are just as effective as hospital-based treatment and could in fact be cheaper than conventional medicine. Support Groups Whilst Dr Humpreys identified that the costs and length of treatment were comparable, the focus of the study examined the care provided in the year after discharge from inpatient treatment, when costs are very different. The study showed that the faith-based approach significantly lowers post-treatment costs by about two-thirds. Groups such as AA and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) encourage their members to rely on their support groups, as opposed to doctors, after leaving hospital. The study suggests that in making connections with other people who have been through similar situations and treatment, individuals are more likely to abstain from drink and drugs and consequently reduce the chances of hospitalisation and costly psychiatric treatment. Speaking on the cost saving benefits of the spiritually orientated programmes, Dr Humphreys has commented: We, as a society, are fortunate to have a developed system of self help organisations that do not cost the taxpayer or the health-care system a dime. Organisations like AA not only reduce human misery, they also take a big burden off of our increasingly resource-strapped health care system. Hence it is important for health care professionals to learn about these organisations and develop connections with them.

The unspoken alcohol problem among UK Punjabis,Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.,,2018-04-03 23:23:58+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Vik Kainth For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need. Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room. The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasnt in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the childs bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her. Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeeps childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says. So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his fathers footsteps. There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isnt unique. A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. Its a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community. More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool: Show More Harjinder moved in with her husbands family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired familys social life centred around the mens excessive drinking. The family, along with young children, would go to a friends house and would stay there until two or three oclock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated. Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They dont want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness."" You might also like: Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped. By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadnt been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and hed been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem. Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didnt feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didnt look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous. ""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone."" Image copyright Vik Kainth When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families. The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions. Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services. For Harjinder, her husbands heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help. She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasnt until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasnt normal. Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didnt acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having. ""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldnt admit it."" Image copyright Vik Kainth Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they dont want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?"" The Shanti Project , where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham. Others include a volunteer-led Sikh Helpline , the Derby Recovery Network , BAC-IN , and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinders husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband. Her husbands family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home. But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadnt stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor.

Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.
There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population.
A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem.

"Love in Recovery, Series 3, The Coat",Award-nominated comedy drama by Pete Jackson and set in Alcoholics Anonymous.,,None,BBC,"Third series of the award-nominated comedy drama set in Alcoholics Anonymous. Written by Pete Jackson and inspired by his own road to recovery. Stars Rebecca Front, John Hannah, Sue Johnston, Paul Kaye and Johnny Vegas. Love in Recovery follows the lives of five very different recovering alcoholics. Johnny Vegas is Andy, the sweet but simple self-appointed group leader. Sue Johnston plays straight talking Julie, whos been known to have the odd relapse here and there - and everywhere. Rebecca Front is the snobby and spiky Fiona, an ex-banker who had it all and then lost the lot. John Hannah is Simon, a snide journalist who’s not an alcoholic – he got caught drink driving, his boss made him attend the meeting, but he fell in love with Fiona and stayed. And, despite her best efforts, she fell in love with him too. Paul Kaye is Danno, a down and out two-bit chancer with a shady past but a lot of heart, who’s desperate to turn his life around. As we follow their weekly meetings, we hear them moan, argue, laugh, fall apart, fall in love and, most importantly, tell their stories. In this second episode, Julie has a bone to pick with Danno, and Andy has finally met a woman – but she’s not all she seems. Writer Pete Jackson is a recovering alcoholic and has spent time in Alcoholics Anonymous. It was there he found, as most people do, support from the unlikeliest group of disparate souls, all banded together due to one common bond. As well as offering the support he needed throughout a difficult time, AA also offered a weekly, sometimes daily, dose of hilarity, upset, heartbreak and friendship. Love in Recovery doesn’t seek to represent an AA meeting exactly as it might happen in real life, but to capture the funny stories, the sad stories, the stories of small victories and of huge milestones, stories of loss, stories of hope, and most importantly, the many highs and lows in the journey of recovery.

Russia: Government mobile app to help alcoholics,New government app aims to help recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.,,8 September 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia has one of the highest alcohol-related mortality rates in the world The Russian government is trying to tackle the countrys notoriously high alcoholism rate with the launch of a free mobile app. The app will provide information for ""people battling addictions that are very hard to fight"" in order to help them to stay clean, says Yevgeny Bryun, the health ministrys leading narcotics official. He tells the M24 news website that it will offer details of nearby support meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, medical advice on keeping the problem under control, and access to online radio programmes run by Alcoholics Anonymous. The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"". Experts are lining up in support of the plan, which they see as a serious attempt to tackle what Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called Russias drinking-culture ""national disaster"". ""Information technology can play a very important role here, as you cant change these patients with pills,"" Dr Oleg Zykov, a leading Moscow drugs specialist, tells M24. Russian men are estimated to drink about 70% more pure alcohol than their American counterparts, and United Nations figures suggest alcohol was the main culprit in 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012. Government incentives, penalties and price hikes seem to be making little difference. But the ideas keep on coming. In Moscow, a pilot scheme will see the citys health department issue certificates to people who stay clean, and the head of Russias anti-drugs service has even suggested devoting a television channel to helping people beat their addictions.

The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"".

Scheme to tackle A&E violence introduced in Glasgow,"A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, is operating in Glasgow.",,2016-03-30 02:10:49+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow. The Navigators Scheme, funded by Police Scotlands Violence Reduction Unit, has been operating at Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) since December. It involves two navigators establishing a connection with people who are victims or perpetrators of violence. They later discuss the agencies and services that can help them. This could include relationship counselling or putting them in touch with organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Shelter. The Navigator scheme is the first to be available for anyone being treated in an accident and emergency department. But a charity in London called Redthread has been running hospital-based violence intervention programmes specifically for young people for the past 11 years No violent oclock Doctors at the GRI said the project was one of the most important innovations they had seen in decades. They hope the scheme can be rolled out to A&E departments across Scotland. Senior consultant, Donogh Maguire, said it was possibly the most valuable non-medical change in the management of A&E in the whole course of his career. Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit Image caption Navigators Tam Begbie and Alan Gilmour have been working at the hospital since December ""I think for inner-city hospitals, this should be a standard means of engaging with the homeless and disenfranchised people that we have coming to our departments,"" he said. ""The reason I say this is because the current mechanisms are failing or the people are not engaging with them, whereas here were getting the navigators catching people at a time when theyre amenable to some intervention."" One of the navigators, Alan Gilmour, said the work was highly unpredictable. ""We dont know whats coming in, we dont know whats happening,"" he said. ""I mean, theres no violent oclock. We begin our shift and we just wait or find out if theres anyone in and if theres not we wait around for that to happen."" By James Shaw, BBC Scotland Its after 10pm on a Thursday in the accident and emergency department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Tam Begbie is sitting on the hard vinyl floor talking to a young woman with peroxide blonde hair slumped in a chair in front of him. In the hubbub of an A&E starting to get busier as the night goes on, no-one else can hear the substance of their conversation. But that is as it should be. Tam is not talking to the woman to explain her treatment or to find out if shes committed a crime. He is simply trying to help. Because as a navigator, that is his job. The agencies behind this scheme are Police Scotlands Violence Reduction Unit and the doctors group, Medics Against Violence. They decided on the job title, navigator, because it describes the aim of the role, which is to help people steer their way through the agencies that might be able to help them escape the lifestyles that are making them victims and possibly perpetrators of violence. Tam discovers the young woman with the broken wrist got the injury in a fall. It might have happened during an argument with her boyfriend. He is now in the reception area, wanting to see her. Tam might decide that it is not safe for them to get together at this point. Transformative effect But he will advise the young woman that he can meet her to talk about her situation tomorrow or the day after. Maybe in a cafe or fast food restaurant - wherever she feels comfortable. He will suggest places where she might seek help. It might be relationship counselling or Alcoholics Anonymous. Or Shelter if she needs to find somewhere new to live to escape an abusive relationship. The genius of the navigator concept is that it offers help to people in the direst need at exactly the time when they might be most ready to make a change. And it recognises that doctors and police officers cannot always offer permanent solutions to deep-rooted problems. The value of the scheme is fully acknowledged by the head of A&E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Alastair Ireland. He allowed the navigators in last December and has seen the difference they can make. At the moment, this is just a small pilot scheme, but doctors at the GRI agree that having navigators in every A&E in Scotland could have a transformative effect on the problems of violence they and the rest of society have to deal with.",{},"['reduction', 'young', 'navigator', 'help', 'introduced', 'violence', 'scheme', 'tackle', 'navigators', 'woman', 'ae', 'unit', 'glasgow']","Image copyright Violence Reduction UnitA project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

UK Punjabi alcohol support services 'see rise in users',The reports follow a BBC survey suggesting 27% of British Sikhs have a family member with a problem.,,9 May 2018,BBC News,"Image copyright Vik Kainth Some ethnic minority alcohol support services have seen an increase in inquiries following a BBC survey suggesting that, despite Sikhism forbidding drinking, 27% of UK Sikhs had a family member with a problem. They reported a rise in contacts from both alcoholics and volunteers. Nottinghams Bac-In has seen an almost sixfold increase in website hits. And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest. Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month. Weve had over 11,500 hits since the article."" Image copyright Vik Kainth Jaz Rai, director of the First Step Foundation, which works with UK Punjabis across England, said it had doubled the size of its weekly support group and was planning a women-only meeting to address the increased demand. The Shanti Project, which works to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham, has also seen an increase. Tina, a British Punjabi mother-of-two, contacted the BBC after reading its coverage of the issue. The reports resonated very strongly with her own experiences, she said. Her husband - a heavy drinker - had been emotionally abusive towards her, Tina said, trying to convince her that she was going mad, and taking out loans in her name to finance his drinking after losing his job as a plumber. ""Theres so much going on in Asian families that no-one addresses,"" she said. ""I just want our culture to open up. ""People need to wake up and realise that alcohol is poison,"" she said. ""I dont want my kids to go through what I went through. I dont want my daughter to think that its normal."" Image copyright Vik Kainth Sharing stories about addiction can play a key role in the path to recovery, according to Alcoholics Anonymous. Recovering alcoholic Sanjay Bhandari told the BBC: ""The thing that resonated most with me was to hear other peoples stories. ""What they experienced, what it was like, and how things got better gave me hope and inspiration, Well I can do that."" The BBCs coverage sparked a discussion on social media, involving Sikh MPs, support services, and people directly affected by the issue. Image copyright Vik Kainth Talking about the issue openly was a good first step towards challenging cultural norms and tackling the problem head on, said Jasvir Singh, on BBC Radio 4s Thought for the Day programme. ""To overcome any fear of shame, its important to look at alcohol misuse as a health condition and treat it with empathy and understanding rather than condemnation and judgement of the person or their family.""

AA: America's Gift to the World,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - AA: America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments.",,2015-04-01 13:36:32+00:00,BBC,"AL Kennedys new Radio 4 documentary - Americas Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best cure for addicts given new science and treatments. This is the background to the story, and how the making of the programme impacted on its presenter. The initials AA are peripherally familiar to many, as is perhaps the name Alcoholics Anonymous. Nevertheless, I think a lot of people don’t know much about AA or the story of its creation – when Bill Wilson, an alcoholic wall street trader with a big idea about staying sober, met an alcoholic doctor, Bob Smith. They talked and understood each other, helped each other get sober and worked out a way they could pass that on. I’ve seen friends ruin their own lives and those of all around them through dysfunctional drinking: the idea of two people finding a way to unravel that nightmare is truly beautiful and fascinating. AA’s desire to preserve its members privacy and to make no grand statements on issues, meant we had to be sensitive about interviews. It’s also probably one reason why AA isn’t well-known outside its membership. AA’s also an intentionally disorganised organisation. I loved looking at a huge association which seems to do exactly what it intends and yet which is specifically engineered to concentrate power and responsibility downwards and to avoid creating authority figures, funding drives, advertising drives and so forth. It seems to reverse modern thinking about success, but has millions of members, has lasted 80 years and still rolls on. With so many products and experiences now designed to exert an addictive or pseudo-addictive influence, I suppose AA pushes against some powerful trends in society. As was pointed out during my research, alcohol use is central to many of our social occasions, celebrations, even some religious ceremonies. Anyone trying to stay away from drink isn’t going to have it easy. AA isn’t for everyone, but it seems to work very well for those who do use it. What I was struck by most of all was the generosity, honesty and compassion of all our contributors. We have hours of wonderful stories and insights that we just couldn’t fit into the programme. The professionals we spoke to were genuinely passionate about trying to understand alcoholism and help alcoholics to recover. AA members were searingly frank about themselves – and very funny - and really had a grip on who they were and how they could meet the world. We also interviewed Al-Anon and Alateen members – those affected by the drinking of others. Their experiences and bravery were startling, humbling. It was really a privilege to meet them all.

Adrian Chiles 'horrified' at drinking 100 alcohol units a week,The TV and radio broadcaster revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week.,,2018-08-21 10:03:38+00:00,BBC News,"Image caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week. Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week. The BBC 5 live host said it was ""horrifying"" to add up his alcohol consumption, which was well over the recommended weekly 14 units. He was told by a doctor he ""cant carry on like this"" and his liver damage could cause cirrhosis or death. Chiles, 51, has tackled the issue of drinking in a new BBC documentary. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Chiles said: ""I was just staggered what I was putting away"". He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I dont really get drunk, I dont misbehave, I dont drink during the day, I dont drink alone, I dont particularly stay up late. ""I just drink something every day. ""There are loads of us who just drink too much and I just wondered why I was so dependent on it in a small way, or is it a big way."" Chiles comments have prompted many people to speak about their own drinking habits. Actress Linda Robson told ITVs Loose Women she thought ""maybe I could have been on the way to being an alcoholic"" when she used to drink a bottle of wine a night. She said: ""My big thing was because I didnt drink in the daytime then I didnt have a problem and I could make myself wait until that time every night so I obviously didnt have a problem. ""But I was still functioning, I was still coming into work."" We are the problem Chiles - who sees himself as a social drinker and not an alcoholic - said he wanted to make the programme after being interested in peoples ideas of what type of drinking counts as alcoholism. For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking. In an interview with the Times, he said on one morning he calculated that he had drunk more than 100 units in the previous week, whereas other times his weekly amount was 80 units. The NHS advises men and women not to drink more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of wine. Chiles said people like him - the ""constant drinkers, the toppers up"" - are ""the problem"". Although his blood tests were completely normal, a scan showed he had mild to moderate fibrosis of the liver - a type of damage that includes scar tissue forming - and significant liver fat. The doctor told Chiles: ""You cant carry on like this. Youre at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis, liver disease and failure - and death."" Image caption In his documentary, Chiles is warned by a doctor: ""You cant carry on like this."" Chiles said it might be easier to ""stop completely"" rather than moderating his drinking, which he said requires planning. He said: ""I think middle-aged supposedly moderate drinkers need to take a look at ourselves. ""I encourage anyone, dont judge yourself, dont panic youre not going to drop dead, but go on an app like Drink Less and measure what youre drinking, be honest with yourself for three weeks."" How does your drinking measure up to the average in countries around the world? Find out below if you are similar to a boozy Belarusian or a teetotal Kuwaiti. Show More Chiles, who used to present ITV Breakfast show Daybreak until 2011, has also spoken about his struggle with anxiety and depression. He told the Radio Times that after first leaving the show he was ""self-medicating with alcohol"". Drinkers Like Us will be broadcast on BBC Two next Monday 27 August at 21:00 BST.

Trending: Why Jim Wolf's makeover video went viral,A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has garnered more than 13 million YouTube hits in a week - but why do stories about the homeless gain such traction on social media? BBC Trending investigates.,,14 November 2013,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The two-hour make-over of a US Army veteran is shown in two minutes A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has been watched more than 13 million times on YouTube in the past week. In two minutes, former soldier Jim Wolf is shown making the transition from bearded and bedraggled to well-groomed and sharply-suited. Since then, the 54-year-old - who has long struggled against poverty, homelessness and alcoholism - has reportedly started to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and is now staying with his sister. Producer Rob Bliss made the video to raise awareness and funds for a Grand Rapids homeless charity, Degage Ministries - which has received $50,000 (£30,000) in donations as a result. Mr Wolfs is not the first story of this kind to gain such traction in social media networks. In September, donations of more than $110,000 (£70,000) poured in for Glen James, a homeless man in Boston who returned a lost bag containing £26,000 in cash and travellers cheques. Billy Ray Harris was able to buy himself a house in Kansas with £110,000 given by strangers touched by his honesty after he returned a £2,500 diamond ring accidentally dropped into his change cup earlier this year. About BBC Trending A hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world Includes posts on the Magazines Trending blog and twice weekly videos via @BBCWorld Weekly radio programme on the World Service More stories from BBC Trending And in 2011, offers of radio work flooded in for Ted Williams after his smooth baritone was recorded by a local newspaper reporter who saw him asking for money by an Ohio roadside. The release of the Jim Wolf video - timed to coincide with Veterans Day - has focused minds on the issue of homelessness. Even so, Mr Bliss, who makes viral videos for a living, described the response as ""pretty incredible"" - far outperforming any other content he has produced. ""The number one thing that makes a video likely to go viral is the feeling it creates,"" he told the BBC. ""The stronger that feeling, the more successful it will be."" Alastair Murray, Project Director at Housing Justice, a UK-based Christian campaigning charity says the video reminds the audience of the possibility of losing a job, a home, and a stable life. ""This video helps people see the real person behind that bearded needy person about whom they feel awkwardness - theres a transformation into a person with whom youd be happy to have a chat,"" he says.

Church rebuilds 1960s singer's life,A 1960s singer songwriter tells an audience in Redruth how his faith helped him to rebuild his life.,,26 October 2011,BBC News,"Image caption John Gaughan worked with many big names in the 1960s but hid his alcoholism for many years From his early teens John Gaughan decided that he wanted to be a singer/songwriter and aim for the very top in the world of popular music. By the time he was 19 years old he had achieved that goal. Mr Gaughan was rubbing shoulders with the most successful writers and publishers of the day. He was also singing with the top stars of the 1960s, as part of the band Hermans Hermits. Mr Gaughan said: ""I was working with Billy J Kramer and Gerry Marsden and in America with Peter Noone and the Bee Gees."" But there was one problem, as he will tell an audience at Redruths Penventon Park Hotel on Friday 28th October. ""My life had really changed, but the only thing that remained constant was that I was an alcoholic. I had the money, and most of the time the alcohol was free."" Mr Gaughan said he felt a huge ""emptiness inside that was increasingly being satisfied by alcohol"". Image caption John Gaughan worked with bands, including the Bee Gees ""On the surface it looked absolutely fantastic. Behind the scenes I had to have a quarter bottle of vodka. I was walking a fine line between not having too much alcohol in my body and having just enough to stop me from shaking on stage."" Eventually his dependence on alcohol took over and within a few years he was a broken man, ""in body, soul and spirit"". Mr Gaughan said: ""I thought I could control it. I would give up drinking for a day, apart from the shakes. I went to my doctor and he said I would just have to give up drinking. I tried clinics, I tried hospitals. But nothing seemed to help. The desire was still there. ""Finally I couldnt cope. My marriage failed and my father died. That just left me devastated."" Mr Gaughan eventually reached a point of total desperation and tried to end it all by throwing himself from the top window of a three storey building. Life changing moment He said: ""I thought I had no hope and no future. So I tried to take my own life. But I landed on my feet. I broke all the bones in my feet. Bones in my back were crushed. Yet my spinal chord remained intact."" During the following months many people called to see him. Mr Gaughan said: ""I was sat their drinking one night, watching the television, thinking Im just going to lose everything again. But words came back to me about the time my Grandma told me about God. So I went to church that night. Nobody spoke to me, and I came away disappointed and went back home and sat there drinking. ""That night a man came to see me and said you dont need to be like that, there is a way out. As he was walking passed my flat he said he felt the need to come and knock on my door and tell me about Jesus. He invited me to his church. I went, and that night my life started to change."" For the past two decades John said he had been given songs by the Lord and his hearts desire was ""to continue to touch peoples lives through testimony and song"". He said his broken bones healed and he has had ""total deliverance from his acute alcoholism"".

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,The US clothing firm is now enjoying five years of profit growth as it recovers from past woes.,,25 September 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright Levi Strauss Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood. The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"". Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling. Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons. So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive. But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky. Mr Berghs father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic. Image copyright Devaki Knowles There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights."" One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh. His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop. ""Im proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life."" Mr Berghs childhood wasnt unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast. It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his fathers mistakes. ""Im pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Theres not a lot that really upsets me. Im not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. Im pretty relaxed."" And he doesnt drink. Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18 So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get."" He insists hes ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time."" Just dont confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Berghs overhaul of Levis has been radical, some might say brutal. The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history. Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levis punched above its weight for decades. Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levis jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain. If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levis was it. Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the companys single most important product But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"". Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levis."" But Levis lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn. Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership. The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"". Levis board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted. After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive. ""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim"" All too aware that Levis was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firms then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them. ""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated."" More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India. The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded. Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less. He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership."" Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The original US patent for riveted jeans, from 1873 Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong."" Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership. ""Its wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world."" The armys downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G.

Retail analyst Marshal Cohen, of market research group NPD, says that yet again Levis has been able to ""reinvent"" itself to a new generation. However, Mr Bergh says the job is far from finished. ""We have made really good progress. Its been harder and taken longer than I expected. ""Im not satisfied with where we are. We still have a lot more work to do.""",{},"['caption', 'image', 'way', 'bergh', 'giant', 'jeans', 'strauss', 'mr', 'business', 'mojo', 'copyright', 'levi', 'levis']","Image copyright Levi StraussChip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world.

"Love in Recovery, Series 3, Making Plans",Award-nominated comedy drama by Pete Jackson and set in Alcoholics Anonymous.,,None,BBC,"Third series of the award-nominated comedy drama set in Alcoholics Anonymous. Written by Pete Jackson and inspired by his own road to recovery. Stars Rebecca Front, John Hannah, Sue Johnston, Paul Kaye and Johnny Vegas. Love in Recovery follows the lives of five very different recovering alcoholics. Johnny Vegas is Andy, the sweet but simple self-appointed group leader. Sue Johnston plays straight talking Julie, whos been known to have the odd relapse here and there - and everywhere. Rebecca Front is the snobby and spiky Fiona, an ex-banker who had it all and then lost the lot. John Hannah is Simon, a snide journalist who’s not an alcoholic – he got caught drink driving, his boss made him attend the meeting, but he fell in love with Fiona and stayed. And, despite her best efforts, she fell in love with him too. Paul Kaye is Danno, a down and out two-bit chancer with a shady past but a lot of heart, who’s desperate to turn his life around. As we follow their weekly meetings, we hear them moan, argue, laugh, fall apart, fall in love and, most importantly, tell their stories. In episode five, talk turns to weddings. What’s it like to go to a wedding as a recovering alcoholic? As usual, the answers are far from simple and the experiences of the group couldn’t be more different. Writer Pete Jackson is a recovering alcoholic and has spent time in Alcoholics Anonymous. It was there he found, as most people do, support from the unlikeliest group of disparate souls, all banded together due to one common bond. As well as offering the support he needed throughout a difficult time, AA also offered a weekly, sometimes daily, dose of hilarity, upset, heartbreak and friendship. Love in Recovery doesn’t seek to represent an AA meeting exactly as it might happen in real life, but to capture the funny stories, the sad stories, the stories of small victories and of huge milestones, stories of loss, stories of hope, and most importantly, the many highs and lows in the journey of recovery.

Pakistan battles growing alcohol addiction,"Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.",,16 September 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majority Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink. The BBCs Charles Haviland finds lives ruined and clinics and therapy groups trying to overcome a taboo subject. Late one night, the beat of dance music drifts down from an upper storey of an apartment block on the edge of a Pakistani city. Inside the flat, the music is pulsating around a dance floor. There is a bar where a range of liquor is being served and cocktails shaken. Under flashing stroboscopic lights, dozens of people laugh, dance and enjoy the drink. This is one of the parties that are now commonplace in the cities but are highly discreet. The liquor is bought illicitly from bootleggers - or from the regular alcohol shops that are supposed to sell only to minorities holding permits but also sell illegally to large numbers of Muslims. Pakistan even has its own breweries which officially produce only for non-Muslims - or for export. Increasing trend Image caption Mr Ahmed was formerly an alcoholic and now runs a rehabilitation organisation The subculture of liquor enjoyment belies Pakistans status as officially ""dry"". That is, the 96% of Pakistanis who, according to official figures are Muslim, are not supposed to drink. The penalty if they do so is 80 lashes but it is not strictly enforced. Although there are many harmless social gatherings, there is also a growing problem of addiction to the bottle. Officials have told the BBC - while not wanting to be quoted - that alcohol-related diseases have risen by at least 10% in the past five years. Tahir Ahmed, a former alcoholic who now runs a rehabilitation organisation, Therapy Works, detects ""a visibly increasing trend"". Six years ago, when he started this work, most drinkers were in at least their 20s; now, some are as young as 14, he says. I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated - and that really frightened me Sara, Alcoholic in Lahore Sometimes alcohol is taken in conjunction with narcotics. He says alcohol has a much firmer presence in the home - especially for the affluent - and at social occasions like weddings. And he says that if a Pakistani drinks, it is usually in large quantities because it is, he believes, a response to the massive social pressures here, including the threat of political violence and high unemployment. ""Unfortunately drinking in Pakistan is not recreational,"" he said. ""Its much more escapist and much more relief-seeking. That means drink till the bottle is emptied."" Now 65, this is the way he himself used to be. He watched two of his friends die of cirrhosis of the liver and nearly died himself. He decided to stop drinking but went into clinical depression for a year. Only then did he receive therapy, later setting up his organisation, which is registered with Britains Counselling and Psychotherapy Central Awarding Body. Taboo for women Drinking among the affluent is especially noticeable. Some senior politicians are rumoured to drink, and alcohol is served at some high-society events, though never on camera. But it affects everybody. Last month, at least 12 people in Karachi died after drinking toxic home-made liquor. Some Pakistani alcoholics are women. For them, the stigma is all the greater. In Pakistans second city, Lahore, Sara - whose name we have changed - recounts her story. Five years ago, aged 33 and with two teenage children, she got divorced. Then alcoholism just sucked her in. She would go binge-drinking for days at a time and suffer blackouts. ""I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated. And that really frightened me."" Image caption Mr Umer said a strict and austere regimen helped him overcome drinking As word got around and she became an embarrassment to her children, Sara wanted to go to a rehabilitation clinic. But being a woman made this very difficult in Pakistan. ""Some men will turn around and say, Okay, I have a problem. But its a taboo for women. A woman will never stand up and say I have a problem and I need help. Thats not acceptable."" Nine months ago, she finally sought assistance and was able to get medicine and therapy-based help at home, from Therapy Works. Now she is recovering. In an unregulated medical market, there are other clinics whose approach to treatment is much more strict. The BBC visited one in Karachi, called Willing Ways, where a group of current and former residents were in a session with the doctor who founded the establishment. Clients are admitted with their families consent, but they do not always realise they will be confined for three months. While living there, they are deprived of all addictive substances including tobacco, and of all external communications. One former patient contacted the BBC and said he felt the set-up was excessively draconian. But a satisfied former client, businessman Yousuf Umer, says the austere regimen worked for him. ""It has changed my life and I am a very successful man now."" Im listening Image caption Dr Mamsa, right, conducts a radio show using a mix of English and Urdu While clinics and therapy-based groups tackle alcoholism, the media is now doing so too. On Karachis Radio 1 91 FM a psychiatrist-broadcaster, Dr Faisal Mamsa, takes calls every Thursday and Friday night on all sorts of social taboos - including this one. ""Go ahead. Im listening,"" he tells callers in soft tones. Sporting a mop of unruly hair and a beard, he wears shorts in the studio. There follows a conversation in a mix of English and Urdu. Calls or texts from affected family members are encouraged. A woman says her husband has been drinking for 13 years but she cannot persuade him to seek help. The doctor suggests they contact Alcoholics Anonymous. The next caller is an addict who admits he is violent. Dr Mamsa says the anonymity of radio makes it ideal for this subject. ""Im not concerned about the name,"" he said. ""If theyre talking about a problem, its not just them whos benefiting out of it but whosoever is listening to the radio is listening about it. What matters is that the problem is being discussed."" There is no chance of Pakistans legally ""dry"" status changing in the near future. Yet there is an alcoholism problem, which officials and doctors say is growing. At least more alcoholics are now coming forward to talk about it - and some are finding a way out of their misery.",{},"['caption', 'growing', 'battles', 'pakistan', 'radio', 'say', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'woman', 'therapy', 'supposed', 'problem', 'addiction', 'social']","Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majorityAlcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink.

Serial drink-driver avoids jail 'for being a woman',A judge tells Victoria Parry she would have been sent straight to prison if she were a man.,,2019-04-12 18:51:44+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Paul Beard Image caption If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman. Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine. Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man. Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues. The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog. Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a vans rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignias wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash. Shocking case He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire. An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldnt be driving"", Mr Sapwell said. She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station. Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake. The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol."" But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since. ""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said. Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months. ""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said. She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling. If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate. ""If you dont comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added.

My Zinc Bed press pack: David Hare,Press Packs,,None,,"My Zinc Bed: a compelling adaptation of David Hares acclaimed play for BBC Two Interview with David Hare, writer, My Zinc Bed What would you say are the central themes of My Zinc Bed? My Zinc Bed is really a study about the arguments about alcoholism. I suppose I knew a lot of friends who were in AA [Alcoholics Anonymous], and because of that I was interested in those arguments about whether alcoholism is a genetically inherited condition that you can do nothing about, and in which you have to surrender your will and treat it as one would treat any other disease – and the argument of AA of rational recovery. AA is an organisation that believes that only by mastering your addiction by willpower can you live a fulfilled life. This seemed to me an extraordinarily interesting argument and thats what I wanted to write about. I was also interested in the question of why addiction is such a contemporary subject. We hear about it all the time now – be it addiction to shopping, dieting, alcohol, drugs, work – it seems very much to have replaced belief. Addiction has taken the place of ideology. When I was young people discussed what they believed and what their ideas were – those ideas were the ideas which shaped their lives. Now young people discuss the things to which they are addicted. So the whole subject of addiction seems to me quite contemporary and near the bone. How did the television version of the play come about? Its often said of my stage writing that its filmic – a series of fast-moving scenes that are physically realised – and when we did the play at the Royal Court Theatre in 2000 it seemed obviously filmic. At the time that I wrote the stage play it was very much the cusp of the internet, and the arrival of all that new cyber business – but that stuff over the years seemed rather too dated. So there was a way of looking at it a few years later – to focus on the basic fable, about whether you can ever be in control of your own recovery, indeed whether anybody can really be in control of their own life, that seemed to become much stronger. It was actually my agent Jenne Casarotto who proposed to HBO the idea that it was time to try and regenerate the single film a little on TV again, and that maybe some plays from the theatre could be adapted once more for television. Theres a quite extraordinary experiment going on at the moment in France whereby a major television channel regularly transmits plays live from Paris theatres, and contrary to all conventional modern broadcasting thinking theyre getting huge audiences and massive success with these transmissions. This is a small-scale experiment I suppose, to try and get some individual films specially made on the BBC. Its nice to remind people that its possible to do interesting things, and particularly if youve got very very good actors like Jonathan Pryce, Uma Thurman, Paddy Considine. You know Uma Thurman doesnt do many television plays – shes doing it obviously because she thinks theres something interesting about it. How did you go about adapting your stage play for the screen, were there any particular challenges involved? It was incredibly easy, and its very rare that you say that! I normally hate adapting my plays for the cinema, and Ive done a few adaptations of my plays for cinema. By and large I refuse to do them, mostly because I find it very difficult to reconceive things for new medium. But this has a very strong story about how a rather indigent poet gets picked up by a couple of rich people and spends a summer with them, and then gets passed aside by them. Films adapt more easily when theyre like short stories, and in a way it took me back to the plays that I used to write for television in the Seventies like Licking Hitler and Dreams of Leaving, which were very much like short stories, novellas almost – and thats a beautiful form for television. Can you describe the three characters? Victor is an entrepreneur who is an ex-communist. Like a lot of people of that hippy generation he then became a businessman and swung all the way from the left-wing ideas of his youth to playing at capitalism with immense success. So hes someone who both has a philosophical hold on capitalism but also is a player within the system. Hes picked up, if you like, by capitalism, made rich, then stripped of his money in the course of the drama. Victors wife, Uma Thurmans character Elsa, is an alcoholic who is trying to recover through rational recovery. The young poet Paul, played by Paddy Considine, is an alcoholic who is trying to do it the other way, through AA. Victor claims to be the only person who isnt an alcoholic in the film but by his behaviour you might think hes as much an alcoholic as Elsa and Paul are. What research did you do for the original play? I went to some AA meetings, I a read a lot of the stuff about it. AA meetings are very welcoming and open. I know when the play happened at the Royal Court it was much discussed by AA meetings – a lot of people at meetings in London were saying have you seen this play, its really interesting because its a philosophical discussion of what our problems are and what the problem of addiction is. So it came out of that. I did do a lot of research but truthfully it was more through watching the agonies of some friends of mine. Were you involved in the casting process at all? Jonathan Pryce was sort of self-selecting! Hes always been one of the foremost actors of my generation. I first worked with him in 1973, and hes just an exceptional film actor – you cant imagine anybody better to play the role. Paddy I didnt know at all, he came to the film, as he put it, never having had to speak long lines before. Hed always appeared in films where he was required to be violent, or moody, and has created a really extraordinary body of work. With my plays there is always a sense immediately whether the actor can say the dialogue or not because I write a certain kind of dialogue that is quite technically demanding and is not naturalistic. Paddy took to that like a fish to water, and I think surprised himself by the ease with which he could play the role – mainly because hed never been asked to play that kind of part before. Hes a writer as well so therefore was a wonderful person to play a poet. Uma Ive known since she was 18 or 19, I first saw her work when she began a film about Dylan Thomas in the late Eighties. Weve always known she was a very good actress but again she might say she hasnt always been required to show that side of her. How do you think the finished piece of work differs on television than on stage?",{},"['david', 'plays', 'television', 'pack', 'bed', 'play', 'hes', 'lot', 'work', 'film', 'hare', 'zinc', 'press', 'addiction', 'aa']","My Zinc Bed: a compelling adaptation of David Hare's acclaimed play for BBC TwoInterview with David Hare, writer, My Zinc BedWhat would you say are the central themes of My Zinc Bed?

#BBCtrending: Bello! The UCL students spammed by their president,"An email simply reading 'bello' triggered 3,000 replies, and gave birth to a new meme.",,9 October 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright @punderachiever When students at a leading London university were sent a mysterious email from a senior official, the #Bellogate meme was born. Students at University College London were sent an email last night, purportedly from the university president, Michael Arthur. It simply contained a one word greeting - ""bello"". By the morning, the message had generated a gigantic email thread, with some students waking up to almost 3,000 unread messages. The hashtag was the top trend on Twitter overnight in the UK, with more than 5,000 tweets using the term since the ""Bello"" email appeared. Many shared emails generated in the thread - in which students continued spamming each other with jokes and puns. ""Bello? Is it me youre looking for"", read one - a play on a Lionel Ritchie song. Others sent invites to cyber security courses, and appealed for missing items of stationery. Some reported they had been signed up to porn sites, dating companies, Alcoholics Anonymous and Sarah Palins website. A parody account soon emerged. Most seemed to see the funny side. ""Ooo we all just got signed up to the Miley Cyrus mailing list. #Bellogate #BelloCameInLikeAWreckingBall"", the UCL Cheesegrater magazine tweeted. One PhD student wrote: ""The funniest thing happened to UCL in years, cant stop laughing."" While some have questioned UCLs security policies, and expressed frustration about having to delete hundreds of unwanted messages, the sharpest criticism was directed at students who kept posting to the thread, by hitting ""reply all"" to the original email. UCL has apologised for ""multiple emails"" received by students, and shut down the mailing list concerned.

The headstones with unusual stories to tell,A tour around the interesting stories found lurking in English graveyards.,,2017-07-01 23:53:51+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Cemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them. Burial grounds such as Highgate in north London, which host the graves of the rich and famous, draw thousands of visitors. But there are scores of other less well known but interesting graves around England. The barmaid who taunted a tiger Image copyright Getty Images In 1703, Hannah Twynnoy became Britains first recorded victim of a tiger. She was a barmaid at the White Lion in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, when a travelling menagerie set up in the pubs large rear yard, ready to attract paying crowds. Hannah was warned against upsetting the tiger but she enjoyed bothering and poking at the big cat - until one day it discovered the cage door was open. Fed up of the pesky barmaid, the tiger launched itself on the unfortunate servant and mauled her to death. The stone, in Malmesbury Abbey has the epitaph: In bloom of life Shes snatched from hence She had not room to make defence; For Tyger fierce Took life away And here she lies In a bed of clay Until the Resurrection Day. The diver who saved a cathedral Image copyright FindaGrave/Getty Images William Walker was a deep-sea diver who, in 1905, was employed to help repair the foundations of Winchester Cathedral. Large cracks had appeared in the cathedrals walls and vaulted ceilings, some of which were wide enough for owls to roost in. Because Winchester has a high underlying water table and the cathedral is built on peaty soil, trenches dug below filled with water before any reinforcing work could be done. So Walker, who usually worked at Portsmouth dockyard, was recruited. A tunnel was excavated beneath the building and for six years he spent nearly six hours a day underwater, in darkness, replacing and shoring up the foundations with his bare hands. He worked entirely by touch. Eventually he propped the cathedral up with 900,000 bricks, 114,900 concrete blocks and 25,800 bags of cement. Because it took him so long to put on and take off his heavy diving suit, when he stopped for a break he would just take off his helmet in order to eat his lunch and smoke his pipe. As if that was not enough effort, each weekend he cycled 150 miles - home to Croydon, south London, before returning to work on Monday. He died aged 49 during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. His grave, at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley, south-east London, bears the words: ""The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral."" The soldier whose beer was too weak In Winchester, there is a grave which pays homage to a 26-year-old grenadier in the North Regiment of the Hants Militia. Thomas Thetcher died after drinking contaminated small (weak) beer when he was hot. Before the invention of modern sanitation, people would drink small beer when fresh water was unavailable. This was because the alcohol was toxic to water-borne pathogens. However, it was not enough to prevent Thetcher catching a fever and dying. Following his death in 1764, his comrades arranged for a jocular headstone inscription warning of the dangers of drink. It read: Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadier, Who caught his death by drinking cold small beer, Soldiers be wise from his untimely fall And when yere hot drink strong or none at all. In 1918, the tombstone caught the attention of a young American soldier called Bill Wilson, who was camped nearby with his US Army unit. Twenty-one years later, following a battle with alcoholism, he founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in 1939 published a book about his experience. In it he claimed the gravestone had been an ""ominous warning which I failed to heed"", and printed the first two lines of the verse in the front of his book. However, it appears he misunderstood the headstone, as he missed out the crucial advice about only drinking strong beer. On 12 May - the anniversary of Thetchers death - people gather at the grave to drink (strong) beer and raise a glass to the grenadier. Peter the Wild Boy Image copyright Neale Monks/Historic Royal Palaces Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725. He could not talk, and would scamper about on all fours rather than walk. When he was about 12 he was brought to London by King George I where he became a ""human pet"" at Kensington Palace. However, his inability to learn table manners or speech, hatred of wearing clothes - even his specially-made green velvet suit - and lack of decorum led to him falling out of favour. The court paid for him to retire to a Hertfordshire farm with a generous pension and when he died, aged about 72, the locals paid for a headstone. Even today, flowers are laid on his grave. Peters funeral was held at St Marys Church, Northchurch , Hertfordshire, and was paid for by the government. His gravestone was provided by local people. At the time, courtiers assumed Peters behaviour was the result of being brought up by wolves or bears. However, modern analysis of a portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome. The bleeding tombstone of Richard Smith St Marys Church in Hinckley, Leicestershire, is the last resting place of Richard Smith who was killed on 12 April 1727, aged 20. Although his headstone is fairly run-of-the-mill, the story behind his death serves as an abject warning to young men with a fondness for messing about when they should be paying attention. According to the local history club, a recruiting sergeant for the army had come to Hinckley and was singing the praises of taking the Kings shilling. Richard, rather than listening, made jokes and quips until the recruiter lost his temper. In a slight overreaction, the soldier gave the crowd an unplanned demonstration in how to use a pike in close quarter combat - and killed Richard. For years there were reports of the headstone appearing red and tradition held the gravestone sweated blood on the anniversary of the murder. However, a more prosaic explanation was suggested by a researcher in 1936. The gravestone used to be positioned under a block of red sandstone and it was thought that the ""blood"" being sweated may have resulted in water dripping from this block. The Woodplumpton Witch Nestled among the neat headstones at St Annes churchyard in Woodplumpton, near Preston, is a boulder marking the grave of Meg Shelton. Known as ""the Fylde Hag"", she was accused of witchcraft in the late 17th Century. Allegations centred on the fairly tame ""stealing milk"" and the more-impressive ""turning herself into a animal"". She was killed in mysterious circumstances when a barrel crushed her against the wall of her cottage. Folklore has it she dug her way out of her grave on more than one occasion. She was eventually buried head down in a narrow shaft so that if she tried to claw her way out she would be heading in the wrong direction - and instead burrow her way to Hell. The boulder was put on top as an extra way of keeping her anchored in the grave. According to legend, if you walk three times around the boulder while chanting ""I dont believe in witches"", Megs bony hand will rise from her grave and grasp your ankle.",{},"['water', 'gravestone', 'way', 'london', 'unusual', 'headstones', 'winchester', 'headstone', 'grave', 'drink', 'copyright', 'death', 'tell']","Image copyright Getty ImagesCemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them.

Recovery movement helps addicts kick the habit in Liverpool,"How former addicts in Liverpool are trying a new programme to kick the habit, as figures show deaths from alcohol are on the increase.",,26 January 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good ""Ah boom chikka boom!"" sings the choir leader. ""Ah boom chikka boom! "" sing back the twenty or so members of the choir. The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus is made up mainly of former drug users and alcoholics from Liverpool. They rehearse in a small room at an addiction charity office and you have to be sober to sing: all members pledge that theyve been off drink or drugs for at least 24 hours. Being in the choir is part of the treatment for these former users, doing something normal like singing with other people. But the choir has a wider significance as the public face of a new programme in tackling addiction called Recovery - a movement in which Liverpool is playing a leading role. Rather than manage an addiction with drug substitutes or controlled drinking, people go through detox and then practise total abstinence. Animal existence Drink-related deaths in the North West are among the highest with men accounting for two-thirds of such deaths in the UK. And figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the problem is getting worse. In the Land of Recovery, its the guinea pigs that wear the white coats. Mark Gilman , NHS Treatment Agency More people in the UK died from alcohol-related conditions in 2010 than in 2009 with the figure rising by 126 to 8,790 from 8,664. But to understand why Liverpool is leading the way in this new idea, we need to go back in time. In the 1980s, it was one of the cities to bear the brunt of a new drug problem - the arrival of brown powder heroin. Addicts stole to feed their cravings, and transmitted HIV and other infections by using dirty needles. To cut crime and improve health, Liverpool was one of the first places to pioneer harm reduction treatments. Users were prescribed methadone to keep them off heroin. It worked, but many people spent years on methadone, and remained addicts. Raucous Caucus singer Colin used drugs for 22 years, and was on methadone for 17. ""Id have done anything for my drugs."" he said. ""I lived an animal existence."" Now, being in the choir is vital for him. ""I love it,"" he said. ""Its really positive for me."" Children of addicts The idea of Recovery, of staying off drink and drugs for good, has been around for some time. Image caption Former addict Colin has been off drugs for two years thanks to the Recovery programme It started in America, but is now taking hold in the UK. Liverpool is still a relatively poor city with high unemployment and poor housing which partly explains why drug and drink addiction is so high; there are twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings here every week. It also explains why Liverpool is at the forefront of the movement in England. Jacquie Johnston-Lynch, of Action on Addiction, said: ""Liverpool has the highest number of [Recovery] Fellowships per head of population in Europe."" Liverpool was where the UKs first Recovery March took place in 2009 and Action on Addiction has opened an alcohol-free bar called The Brink. But the idea of ""Recovery"" has sparked furious debate in drug treatment circles. Some dont like the idea of users taking more responsibility for their own treatment. Mark Gilman, leader of the NHS Treatment Agency, said: ""In the Land of Recovery, its the guinea pigs that wear the white coats."" But Martin says Recovery is important because it could put an end to the problem where the children of addicts become addicts themselves. ""If you get this right, youre the firewall between the intergenerational transfer of addiction,"" he said. ""It sounds grand, but thats the prize on offer.""",{},"['movement', 'helps', 'drugs', 'choir', 'users', 'kick', 'recovery', 'liverpool', 'addicts', 'idea', 'drug', 'treatment', 'habit', 'boom', 'addiction']","Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good""Ah boom chikka boom!""

Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children. The number of victims is not known, but a police officer involved in the case estimated it may be as many as 40. Johnson, 51, from Putney, south-west London, admitted five counts of voyeurism over a 12-year period. He was caught when two 14-year-old girls spotted his camera-phone from under the cubicle adjacent to them and alerted staff, Kingston Crown Court heard. Stalked children After Johnson was identified in CCTV footage, police seized two computers containing hundreds of images of women in various states of undress. Johnson admitted voyeurism between 1 January 2005 and 5 June 2017. Two of the charges relate to filming the 14-year-old girls, while a third relates to images of women taken under cubicles at a leisure centre. Two more charges relate to images of women taken through ""peepholes"" in toilets and changing rooms at an Eddie Catz soft play centre. His defence lawyer claimed Johnson had not meant to film teenagers. However, prosecutor Lauren Sales said CCTV shows Johnson ""stalking children around the leisure centre"".

Defence lawyer Tom Williams said Johnson was plagued by alcohol problems and marriage troubles. ""He is truly sorry for what he has done and has done everything he can to address those things in his life which pushed him into an extremely dark place in that period,"" Mr Williams said.

Jay-Z and Meek Mill pledge $50m to free prisoners,"The rappers aim to free one million people who they say are ""trapped in the system"".",,2019-01-24 12:42:37+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jay-Z and Meek Mill have partnered with the owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, among others, to launch the Reform Alliance Jay-Z, Meek Mill and sport and business leaders have pledged $50m (£38m) to reform the US criminal justice system. The Reform Alliance, which was inspired by Meek Mills recent stint in prison for a minor probation violation , hopes to free one million prisoners in five years. The owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, Robert Kraft and Michael Rubin, are co-founders. Reform says it wants to help people who are ""trapped in the system"". The groups ""mission"" is to ""dramatically reduce the number of people who are unjustly under the control of the criminal justice system, starting with probation and parole"". ""To win, we will leverage our considerable resources to change laws, policies, hearts and minds,"" it says. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reform founders: Jay-Z with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the 76ers Michael Rubin, Meek Mill, Michael Novogratz, Clara Wu Tsai, Daniel Loeb and the groups CEO Van Jones More than six million people can currently count themselves as part of the ""correctional population"" of the USA - which includes people in prisons and local jails, but is mostly made up of the more than four million people on probation or parole, according to Bureau of Justice statistics. Probation is often given as a sentence instead of time in prison and can include conditions like being on a curfew or going to rehab. Parole is when an inmate is released early from prison with similar conditions to probation. Meek Mill has experienced all three: probation, parole and jail. The Reform Alliance says his case is an example of the ""devastating and long-lasting effects"" that can occur after one interaction with the criminal justice system. The rapper was arrested in 2007 - he says wrongfully - for drug and gun charges, aged 19. He was sentenced in 2009 to between 11 and 23 months in county prison, but was released on parole after five months and put on house arrest. It was during this time he started to make his name nationally as a rapper, signing to Rick Rosss label and releasing a string of hugely successful mixtapes. Before long he was a platinum-selling artist. But a parole violation for suspected cannabis use resulted in a ban on touring, and then after failing to get his travel plans approved by the court Meek was sentenced to prison again in 2014. Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable. Examples of parole violations that can land people back in prison range from being late to appointments with parole officers or missing a curfew, to things more specific to the crime that was committed - like failing to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. ""When you talk about these so-called technical violations, its not technical to the kid who can never see her mum again because she showed up late for a meeting. Thats not technical, thats devastating for that individual child,"" Reform Alliance CEO Van Jones said. Violations over the next few years resulted in his probation period being extended - it now lasts up until 2023 - as well as the five months in prison which ended in April 2018 and birthed the #FreeMeek movement. Its people with a similar story to Meeks, that have been ""caught up on probation and parole"", that Reform says it wants to focus on first. Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable. If someone commits a crime they should go to jail ""Being from the environment Im from, I dont even think its possible for you to be an angel,"" Meek said as the organisation was announced in New York. ""You grow up around murder on a daily basis, you grow up in drug-infested neighbourhoods. ""And every time I started to further my life with the music industry, there was always something that brought me back to ground zero,"" he said. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who attended the event, said he was a supporter of criminal justice reforms that are ""fair, help our system work better and smarter, and save crucial taxpayer dollars while balancing public safety and victim concerns"". Across the US, roughly a third of people on parole are black, according to Bureau of Justice statistics - something Jay-Z raised at the event. ""We want to be very clear. If someone commits a crime they should go to jail. But these things are just disproportionate and the whole world knows it,"" he said. Sorry, this Twitter post is currently unavailable. Jay-Z has been vocal about Meeks case, writing in the New York Times while he was imprisoned. ""On the surface, this may look like the story of yet another criminal rapper who didnt smarten up and is back where he started,"" he wrote . ""Whats happening to Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day. ""I saw this up close when I was growing up in Brooklyn during the 1970s and 1980s. Instead of a second chance, probation ends up being a land mine, with a random misstep bringing consequences greater than the crime.

"John McAfee: Addict, coder, runaway","John McAfee speaks to the BBC about his time on the run after his neighbour was found murdered, his addiction to drugs and why he thinks Silicon Valley needs a shake-up.",,11 October 2013,BBC News,"Who is the real John McAfee? Hes the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. Hes the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet. Within tech circles hes long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with his neighbours death. Police say he remains a ""person of interest"". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female ""friends"" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSAs cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a ""master manipulator"" who lies and deceives. Image caption John McAfee returned to the US last December after being released from a Guatemalan jail ""Ive been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley,"" McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: ""Im an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. ""I think that its when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldnt look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. ""Were missing that. Were missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see whats there."" This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: ""Hes sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. Hes serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. Hes generally a sweet guy. He just doesnt like to be [expletive] with."" So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-olds past. Addicted and expelled Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. When she tried to shoot me in the head, what I saw was a frightened child. Im deaf in one ear now, but I dont have a bullet in my head John McAfee ""I feel as much British as I do American,"" McAfee says. ""Theres not much difference between our countries."" They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. Image caption John McAfee played up to his bad boy reputation in a video he uploaded in June ""Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind,"" he says. ""I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. ""I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in peoples offices. It was a bizarre time."" Image caption McAfee says he has never used anti-virus software Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. ""It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter,"" he says. ""I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. ""However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And Im afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. Thats why people think, perhaps, Im a little bit off the wall."" Anti-virus millionaire Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: ""Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS."" ""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, Id never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology,"" remembers McAfee. ""It fascinated me."" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McAfee speaks to Leo Kelion about his life and why he fled from the police in Belize He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). ""I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers,"" he says. ""Theres always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you. Someone who thinks youre a hero and some that think youre a villain John McAfee ""Its why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. ""So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could."" Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. ""Im constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. ""I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. ""Porn sites, for example, I just dont go there. ""Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, Im not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. ""It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone elses software."" Image caption John McAfee says he has not taken drugs or drunk alcohol for nearly three decades After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in ""trikes"" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. Research and raid In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. ""I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. ""Up until about 10 years ago we didnt even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics."" He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the countrys Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didnt go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police forces Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. ""Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab,"" he states. ""Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. Image caption McAfees Quorumex project attempted to create new treatments using plants from Belizes jungles ""Its a pirate haven. Its an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. ""I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. ""I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound."" McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the ""barbaric assault"" on McAfee was a ""global black eye"" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. ""I do wish that I were smarter socially,"" reflects McAfee. ""I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive."" Image caption Amy Emshwiller moved with John McAfee to the Caribbean town of San Pedro At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. ""I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me,"" remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. ""[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me."" She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. ""He didnt know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. I didnt quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns Chad Essley, Graphic novelist ""I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. ""When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didnt know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: I still love you, I dont know what to do. Im in love with a young girl. Thats how that happened."" McAfees long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfees gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. ""Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it,"" McAfee explains. ""Of course shes not going to be well. Of course shes going to have issues. ""When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. Image caption After the raid on his Carmelita property, McAfee moved to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye island ""What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. ""What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesnt help her. ""All she did was burst my eardrum. Im deaf in one ear now, but I dont have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?"" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. ""One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat,"" she says. ""And he just said: Go ahead. Kill me. And I couldnt do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out."" Image caption Cartoonist Chad Essley is working on a graphic novel about McAfee which is due for release next year Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belizes biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfees life. ""I didnt quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns,"" he says. ""Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. ""It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didnt want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. ""I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John."" Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbours activities. Hatchet buried On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: ""Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more."" That night the local TV bulletin declared that ""the hatchet was formally buried"", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belizes authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. Image caption Gregory Faull was found shot dead at his home in Belize The head of the polices Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faulls murder, and now he feared for his own life. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me, he says. ""The government does from time to time. ""I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. ""Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said thats absurd. At the time I did not think so."" McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwillers dogs a poisoned tortilla. ""The entire five years I was there, Id said maybe 15 words to him,"" he says. ""He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. ""There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as Im beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that."" Image caption John McAfee dyed his hair black as part of one of his disguises In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfees dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had ""terrified"" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property ""at all hours"", causing a disturbance. ""I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States,"" says McAfee when pressed about this. ""Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer."" Hiding out McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be ""silenced"" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldnt be made to disappear if he had been caught. Image caption Prime Minister Dean Barrow said it was ""utter and complete nonsense"" that the police wanted to kill McAfee ""I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,"" he recalls. ""All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. ""You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that."" Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belizes prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a ""person of interest"". ""I dont want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,"" the politician added. Belize and corruption The BBC put Mr McAfees claims of corruption to the Belize government, which is currently embroiled in a scandal involving the issue of a passport to a South Korean man who had never visited the country. It sent this reply: Belize has made great strides in improving transparency and ethical behaviour across all government departments. Where any sniff of corruption and evidence of such has been proven, the prime minister and the government have moved swiftly to stamp it out. This has most recently been demonstrated by the sacking of the junior minister of immigration. The US government and the Commonwealth have been instrumental in supporting Belize in addressing governance issues as we work to reduce even the appearance of fraud and corruption. Corruption is a cancer that Belize will continue to correct - it has no place in government or in any public office and we do not and will not tolerate it. The past is the past and this Belize government cannot change the behaviour of previous administrations or officials, but the prime minister has vowed to root out corruption wherever and whenever it occurs. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. ""When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: Come to this place, or go there, she recalls. ""How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me."" She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfees life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. ""I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,"" remembers McAfee. ""We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-ones real fault. It was just the fault of the moment."" A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. ""After it was over I asked myself, Good Lord, I must have been afraid,"" he says. ""But I really cant remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred."" Hero and villain McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faulls death, but says an attempt to contact the victims family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a ""hollow gesture"" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. Image caption John McAfee continued to give interviews even when being held by the Guatemalan authorities A spokesman for the countrys government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. ""Mr McAfees claims and his behaviour have been extreme,"" he told the BBC. ""The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize."" So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. ""Theres always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,"" he says. ""Someone who thinks youre a hero and some that think youre a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that Im totally innocent."" That doesnt mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. ""If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,"" he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in peoples pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners devices within a three-block radius. Image caption John McAfee is working with a Canadian company to make a documentary about his life He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. Hes also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowdens leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. ""You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,"" he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfees life, its impossible to be sure of all the facts and its ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.",{},"['im', 'caption', 'mcafees', 'mcafee', 'belize', 'came', 'coder', 'later', 'john', 'runaway', 'addict', 'head', 'going']","Who is the real John McAfee?

Eight unhelpful things to say to an alcoholic,It's painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction.,,None,,"Its painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction. And its easy to get angry about how their behaviour is affecting the people around them. But if you want to help, you need to know the right things to say. Newsbeat asked three recovering alcoholics to explain what didnt help them, and what they wish their families had said. 1. Why do you need to drink? ""At first Id say, Because I like it,"" Tracey says. Her husband had just left the family and she thought alcohol was helping her numb the pain. But when her children asked her why she was drinking, she became resentful. She says as a result she even increased the amount she was drinking. ""They were trying to be helpful but to me they werent because I was in denial."" But as time went on, she became scared of the addiction. ""I got more open because I was frightened, and I could say, I dont know how to stop any more. I need help."" She says its important to try to understand the reasons behind someones drinking problem, and try not to be judgemental. 2. Why cant you just stop? Alcoholics can be physically addicted, meaning their body has come to rely on alcohol to feel ""normal"". Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations and seizures. ""I just couldnt stop. Not at the time. Medically I couldnt,"" says Tracey. ""You can go into fits if you stop just like that."" She was drinking a bottle of vodka a night and would have panic attacks if there was no booze in the house. ""People need to understand its an illness,"" Tracey insists. It can take between three months and a year to fully recover from the effects of alcohol withdrawal. Tracey managed to quit because her family took her to the GP. She spent time in hospital and was put on medication to help. 3. Youre selfish As families grow tired of an alcoholics drinking, they can often start to criticise them more aggressively. This made Traceys behaviour more spiteful, she says. ""I was selfish,"" says Tracey. ""But at the time I couldnt see that. ""Its dreadful to think thats what I used to do. I should have been coming home and thinking, What am I going to cook [my daughter] for tea? ""But all my mind was fixated on was coming home to have a drink."" Ambrose, whos been off alcohol for nine months, says: ""I could see I was hurting and upsetting people. ""I couldnt cope with feeling guilty so I ended up drinking more to forget that I felt guilty."" Tracey says its best to avoid using combative language if youre trying to help someone with an alcohol problem. Instead, try to be sympathetic. ""I just wanted them to say, Look Mum, we know youve got a problem. Were here to help you."" 4. Dont you love us? Tracey says her children asked her this often. ""I thought, What a horrible thing to say. ""I knew I did love them. Why would it change because Ive had a drink? ""But obviously I wasnt showing them."" For Rose, who stopped drinking three years ago, it was ""nothing to do with love"". ""If I was able to have stopped of course I would have. ""It wasnt a choice. It was a necessity,"" she says. 5. How are you able to afford this? ""If I had no electricity Id ask my mum for help to pay for more,"" remembers Rose. ""And sometimes shed say, Oh - but you can afford drink. ""Unfortunately she was probably right. But it doesnt help."" 6. Shouting and screaming ""Get yourself together"" and ""youre a mother for Gods sake."" Rose remembers these words being shouted at her but she says she only had time to reflect once the shouting stopped. ""There was silence and it gave me room to think. ""Calmly people said to me, Were so worried about you. Youre going to die. We dont know what to do. ""I wanted to die in my sleep. I couldnt see how I could ever stop drinking. ""But the silence let me see the pain my family were going through."" 7. We wont drink either Rose finds it patronising when she goes for dinner with friends and someone says something like, ""none of us are going to drink either"". ""They make a huge deal about them not having alcohol. Actually it makes me feel uncomfortable. ""Id much rather they said something like, Oh, do you mind if I have a drink? ""When people are being obviously super careful it can be difficult."" Tracey still goes to the pub with her friends but she says she would never expect them not to drink on her behalf. 8. Are you strong enough? Since he stopped drinking Ambrose says he dislikes when people ask if hes strong enough to stay off it. ""When they ask that I think, Cheers mate, thanks for having faith in me."" He understands history may have taught people recovery can occasionally have setbacks but he says: ""Its people having negative thoughts and passing them on to me. ""It puts a negative thought in my head and I start to wonder if Im kidding myself."" Links to advice and help You can get advice about alcohol on the BBC Advice pages.

Alcohol dependency: When social drinking becomes a problem,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event, but turn into dependency and addiction, experts say.",,15 December 2012,BBC News,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say. So when does social drinking become alcoholism? In the festive season, with office parties, Christmas, and new year, there is opportunity aplenty for yet another tipple. Since the 1950s, alcohol consumption in the UK has gradually increased. The NHS now spends more on alcohol-related illness among baby boomers than any other age group, with £825m spent on 55 to 74-year-olds in 2010-11 compared to £64m on under-24s. Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink Organise their lifestyle around drinking Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol Estimates also suggest about nine per cent of men and three per cent of women in the UK show signs of alcohol dependence. But it is the functioning alcoholic that can slip under the radar - before their health issues are severe enough to need treatment. Straight vodka Dr John Marsden, an alcohol and drug dependency expert from Kings College London, says a typical functioning alcoholic can manage to hold down a job despite having a ""very severe drinking problem that they have been incubating over a very long period"". ""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight. They are hidden from view which makes functioning alcoholics a group we cannot easily help."" Rob C, who is 61, was one of them. At his worst he was drinking 1.5 litres of straight vodka per day. ""Then I began to suffer blackouts, losing whole days and not remembering anything."" He would be first to arrive at work, which made him able to set out his ""drinks for the day with what looked like a bottle of mineral water"". ""I would hide bottles around the office. You think nobody else knows, that it doesnt smell, that youre getting away with it. But of course they did notice."" Life saver For several years, maintaining a full-time finance job, he drank increasingly more during the day. There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that Dr John Marsden, Addiction expert What started as a social pastime nearly cost him his relationship. Now sober for eight years, looking back he says that even if a colleague had said something at the time, he would not have listened. ""I resented the changes at work and told myself I deserved a drink. I would buy wine at lunchtime and drink it from a polystyrene cup."" Wine turned to vodka for a ""bigger kick"" and lunchtime turned to morning through to night. Early retirement on medical grounds made his addiction worse. It was only when his partner threatened to kick him out that he sought help with Alcoholics Anonymous, who he says saved his life. Rob is not alone. In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease. Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, a liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, believes the number of people dying from liver disease will keep rising. The majority of people who have alcohol-related health problems are middle-aged, which Sir Ian says is a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse - many years of frequent heavy drinking, rather than binge drinking - a session of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a small space of time. But he says that though there is a big overlap, it is important to remember not all heavy social drinkers are dependent on alcohol. ""Some people can control their drinking after work, others cant. If people are frequently drinking harmful levels of alcohol - over 50 units a week for men, 35 for women - most will end up suffering some form of physical, mental or social harm."" A lifetimes worth of drinking is catching up with baby boomers, says Emily Robinson from the Alcohol Concern. The charity hopes that their campaign, Dry January, will help get people thinking about how much they drink, especially at home when units are harder to measure, and crucially, before they reach a stage where drinking is affecting their health. ""The issue of people drinking every day is worrying as its a way of slipping into dependency, as you need to drink a little more each time to feel the same effects,"" she says. Dr Marsden suggests the line between social drinking and dependency is clear. He says the first question that needs to be asked by clinicians or family members is: ""Has anyone expressed concern to you about your drinking?"" Whats a unit? Half a pint of standard strength (4%) beer, cider or lager A single pub measure of spirit (25ml) Half a standard glass of wine (175ml) Alcohol units guide This question assesses whether a persons behaviour has negatively impacted on someone close to them, he adds. ""If your alcohol consumption has caused a problem for someone else - Im not rushing to label you an alcoholic but suggesting you need to take a closer look at your behaviour."" There is a clear reason the baby boomer generation is now most at risk from alcohol-related problems, argues Dr Marsden. A hard-working generation led to an appetite for entertainment and relaxation. ""There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that.""",{},"['problems', 'dependency', 'work', 'baby', 'alcoholrelated', 'health', 'alcohol', 'drinking', 'problem', 'drink', 'social']","Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say.

BBC – Maestro – News – The Thoughts of Alex and Brad,Alex: “The first thing you have to learn as a conductor is how to stand up straight.”,,None,,"Recent News The Thoughts of Alex and Brad Student Alex James and his mentor Brad Cohen talked to John Elmes of The Independent. Here is a digest of their remarks Alex: ""The first thing you have to learn as a conductor is how to stand up straight. If you stood on a rock stage like that, people would throw pints of urine at you. Classical music is quite irksome, it emanates a sort of pomposity, but its one of the best things I have ever done, Im loving it. ""You dont need to have been to a conservatoire to write pop songs, and its more expensive to train conductors than it is to train astronauts or fighter pilots, but theres something about classical music. Yes, the classical-music fraternity are worse than Christians or Alcoholics Anonymous for wanting you to join, theres a kind of desperation about it sometimes, but when youre ready for it, it blows your mind. ""Theres a misconception that classical music is for old people, so it does need rebranding. I would definitely recommend that kids listen to Rossini. You know, rocknroll is 50 years old now, and I wonder if it hasnt said everything it has got to say. Classical music really makes you appreciate what youre doing when youre playing a big, loud, out-of-tune, distorted bass."" Brad: ""Conducting is not about pomp or mastery. Its about communication and creating an atmosphere in which everyone feels theyre pointing in the same direction, and working towards a similar goal. ""There have been times when Alex has found it hard - starting something completely new, and having to stand up in front of a group of people and feel like a prat - but were very patient with each other. Were mates. ""Ive listened to some Blur since I started working with Alex, and we have a lot of fun together. Both being musicians helps - theres a lot of common ground and our sensibilities are similar. ""Alex knows theres a lot about conducting that is nothing to do with music, but the musical side is obviously a lot easier because he can read music, while other competitors on Maestro can only do so in a very limited way. Its a great advantage, with so much musical material to master, that he can learn scores a lot quicker.

Amsterdam alcoholics paid in beer for collecting litter,A group of alcoholics is being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam. Anna Holligan joined the alcoholics on litter collection duties.,,6 January 2014,BBC News,"Image caption Collecting litter on Amsterdams streets is a way to raise money legally Alcoholics are being paid in beer to clean the streets of Amsterdam as part of a project partly funded by the Dutch government - the organisers think other countries should abandon ""old-fashioned political correctness"" and adopt the same approach. Rene scours the streets, grasping at discarded wrappers. His movements are fuelled by a tangible pride. It is an unfamiliar emotion for a man whose alcohol addiction has cost him so much. ""I have four children and three ex-wives, but alcohol has finished everything. I dont see them, they dont know where I am, or if I am alive. Now I have only him. He is there for 30 years, when times are good and bad, he is always there,"" he says, referring to his habit. His affectionate gaze travels downwards. It rests on an aluminium can. Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group. It is a private but primarily government-funded company, which helps those struggling to cope due to homelessness, drug abuse or alcoholism. A gas heater emanates warmth; someone hums along to the theme tune from Armageddon. Rene, 52, has just cracked open his third can of the day. It has just gone 11:30 in the morning. Image caption Rene has four children and three ex-wives but now he is devoted to alcohol He is one of 20 alcoholics who have joined this initiative. They arrive at 09:00 and work until 15:00. They take extended breaks for beer, cigarettes and a hot lunch, all provided free of charge. The distinctive aroma of stamppot, a traditional Dutch vegetable stew, wafts through from the kitchen. The air is hazy with smoke and camaraderie; another pop anthem fills the room with nostalgia. ""They like to cook and you see qualities they didnt even know they had,"" says Janet van de Noord, who runs the Rainbow Groups litter project. Cost-effective ""Its quite difficult to get these people off the alcohol completely. We have tried everything else. Now this is the only thing that works. We might not make them better, but we are giving them a better quality of life and its better for the neighbourhood, theyre giving something back to society."" Inside an oversized garden shed, decorated with Ajax football paraphernalia, about 6,000 cans of beer are stacked in crates. The Rainbow Group is reluctant to say exactly how much the Dutch government pays towards the free beer, cautious of generating any negative publicity that might jeopardise their funding. But Ms van de Noord argues it is a cost-effective way to tackle the impact of alcoholism. ""If people are being arrested, it also costs society a lot of money. So this can only be a good thing. I dont see why other countries wouldnt want to do it."" When I asked other Dutch people about the project they all spoke in favour of it. Ten minutes walk from the now litter-free streets lies Amsterdams Oosterpark. Image caption Oosterpark is no longer strewn with litter but some alcoholics have not been persuaded to give up their park benches Fountains propel shimmering bursts of water; leaves create an autumnal collage on the path. This slice of Dutch life is interrupted by a man staggering towards us. ""Mooooi!"" (""beautiful"") he says, greeting us with a sleazy smile. But he quickly makes it clear that he and his friends do not wish to be interviewed. He is one of the remaining alcoholics who have not been persuaded to abandon their park benches. Since the street-cleaning programme started 12 months ago, local police have received fewer reports of stabbings and muggings in the park. And all of the residents we spoke to said they were happy with the government supporting this unconventional approach. Instead of being ostracised by society, the alcoholics needs appear to have been incorporated into the Dutch healthcare system. The Rainbow Group is optimistic their success so far will attract more funding and help them to reach the unreachable. Other cities in the Netherlands are now considering introducing similar schemes. Floor van Bakkum of Amsterdams Jellinek anti-addiction clinic says the project is a good way to deal with ""a very problematic group - its kind of harm reduction"". She likened it to giving carefully monitored methadone or heroin doses to chronic heroin addicts. ""It might help them to do something else with their life. You always have to monitor such a project, so it shouldnt attract new alcoholics - its not an open invitation to drink in Oosterpark."" She said such a scheme would be inappropriate for alcoholics who still live at home and have a job. Unchangeable reality Back on litter duty, Rene tells me about his past life - expensive cars, extensive travel and some details best not shared. But, he insists, he is happier now, with nothing. He detects our incredulity: ""You dont believe me? Trust me, if I could have my life again I would give it all up for this. ""I know he will never expect anything from me or let me down. Now I am free,"" he says, referring to the drink habit. Some might wonder, how free can an addict be? But the founders of this project treat this addiction as an ""unchangeable reality"" and tackle it using the only device that is guaranteed to connect with the patients. ""I come for the beer. If there was no beer then why would I come?"" says Rene. Regardless of their motivations, Rene and his friends are making a positive difference in a community where they were once despised. ""Its true,"" Rene concedes, acknowledging the irony. ""They used to treat us like garbage - and now we are picking up their garbage, we are not the garbage anymore.""",{},"['paid', 'beer', 'dutch', 'litter', 'collecting', 'rene', 'group', 'alcoholics', 'life', 'project', 'streets', 'rainbow', 'amsterdam']","Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group.

In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith argued that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system. The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a ""hypothetical"" one. One drug charity said such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent"". In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the governments drug strategy but these were not pursued. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits - citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade. The government also says 80% of the UKs 400,000 ""problem drug users"" are claiming out-of-work benefits. Road to recovery In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said ""the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track"". ""We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause. ""We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work."" There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery Martin Barnes, DrugScope Mr Duncan Smith said the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year - more details of which will be published on Thursday - will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants. ""Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,"" he added. ""Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future."" The BBCs political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, hinted that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits. But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to ""track people through the system"" and ensure they get the help they need. ""Hypothetically people could lose benefits,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment."" No evidence Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the governments flagship welfare-to-work programme. One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to ""clarify"" their position on sanctions for refusing treatment. ""We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,"" said its chief executive Martin Barnes ""If accurate, this would be a reversal of the governments publicly stated position."" It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use. ""There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,"" Mr Barnes added. ""Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems."" All those claiming employment and support allowance - which has replaced incapacity benefit - are currently being re-assessed under plans aimed at getting more people into work and reducing the welfare bill. Critics have complained that the medical tests being used are flawed and too many people are being deemed fit to work when they are not.",{},"['benefits', 'benefit', 'help', 'work', 'addicts', 'recovery', 'support', 'drug', 'treatment', 'smith', 'state']","Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crimeThe state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said.

Living in the grip of alcohol,Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has started drinking again. How difficult is it to fight alcohol addiction?,,4 February 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Paul Gascoigne has an ongoing battle with alcohol Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has been struggling with an addiction to alcohol. The 45-year-old was shaking and slurred his words on stage at a charity event in Northampton on Thursday and his agent, Terry Baker, says he now fears for Gascoignes life. Alex Best, widow of football legend and recovering alcoholic George Best who died in 2005, is also concerned. She told The Sun newspaper: ""Seeing Gazza in such a bad way brings back the most horrible memories of George when he was in the grip of the drink that eventually killed him. ""Its heartbreaking to see Paul so deeply gripped by his addiction again."" Relapse can be part of recovery. Thats when they really learn to move on. Ive worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end Julie Rogers, Substance misuse manager Dependency NHS figures suggest nine in every 100 men and four in every 100 women show signs of alcohol dependence. Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day. You dont necessarily have to be rolling around drunk to have a dependency on alcohol - people may be able to hold down a career and drink in a way that is damaging. Dependency mean you are physically and psychologically tied to booze - you feel compelled to drink and this takes its toll on your physical and emotional health. Julie Rogers has been working in the addiction field for 12 years, helping people who are hooked on alcohol. Ms Rogers, who works with the charity Foundation 66, says problem drinking is a complex and incredibly difficult behaviour to break. No two people are the same and there is no single approach that is guaranteed to work. ""Alcohol addiction does not have any boundaries. It affects all types of people alike. It doesnt matter if you are wealthy or poor. Warning signs of alcohol dependence Worrying about where your next drink is coming from and planning social, family and work events around alcohol Finding you have a compulsive need to drink and finding it hard to stop once you start Waking up and drinking - or feeling the need to have a drink in the morning Suffering from withdrawal symptoms, such as sweating, shaking and nausea, which stop once you drink alcohol ""And there are so many different reasons why people drink. But the thing they do have in common is that, for them, alcohol has become more than just a drink. ""It becomes something that you need to do to cope and get through. Thats when it becomes a problem."" For some, the trigger is stress or anxiety - a demanding job or a traumatic divorce, for example. She said for others it is a learned behaviour - something they have been exposed to during their childhood and have grown up to follow the same path. Genetics can also make some people susceptible, experts suspect. Breaking the cycle Regardless of the cause, the first step to tackling addiction is the same. Ms Rogers said: ""Recognising you have a problem and then seeking help is the first step. ""It sounds simple but, in reality its not. It can be hard to admit you have a problem and actually do something about it."" The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player has tried hard to fight his addiction, spending repeated spells in rehab over the last decade. Alcohol harms Short term health risks include alcohol poisoning and accidents and injuries Long term health consequences include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease (which can cause jaundice), pancreatitis and certain cancers Drinking too much can also affect your relationships and your ability to hold down a job It can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings Gazzas drinking problems started during his playing days. In 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl, he was admitted to the The Priory Hospital in Marchwood, near Southampton, to receive treatment for stress and drink problems. In 2001, whilst playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith. Four years after retiring, in 2008, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act and was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead. More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth. Ms Rogers says relapses are incredibly common, and they shouldnt be seen as a failure. ""Its important that we do not judge relapse because that just compounds the shame and guilt people feel about it. Dennis story I took my first drink in my early teens. There were consequences from my drinking from the beginning, very small at first: arguing with friends, turning up late for social appointments, losing keys, urinating in alleyways, and general behaviours I would not engage in when I wasnt drinking. As I reached my 20s I had destroyed a marriage by now, and I was well on that alcoholic slippery downhill slope. I was starting to lose jobs as I could not be trusted to turn up for work. Into my 30s, my drinking very subtly but progressively got worse; the dry spells between my binges got shorter and shorter. I had started too waken up in strange places and also in A&E hospitals and couldnt remember how I got there. The last 10 years of my drinking, I had tried many avenues of escape in order to stop drinking completely and failed every single time. At 40 years old I was truly beaten by alcohol. I had heard and of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and had visited AA meetings in the past but nothing else, I would visit and then leave and eventually always drink again. I did not know what it was to be an alcoholic, and I had not fully admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic. Now, through AAs 12-step recovery programme, I have a productive, contented life with complete abstinence from alcohol. ""Relapse can be part of recovery. Thats when they really learn to move on. Ive worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end. ""Even if it is your thousandth relapse, it can still be the last. Its important not to give up."" She said in order to break the cycle some people need to hit a critical point where its ""stop drinking or die"". Help on hand But for others, abstinence is never an option. Instead, they might work towards curbing their intake, even if it means they are still drinking far too much for good health. ""Some people reduce the harm rather than stop drinking. ""Some relapse every few months but still lead a fulfilling life. Even if you get a month of sobriety at least its a month."" She said there is plenty of help available to anyone struggling to keep their drinking under control. ""Your first port of call should be your GP who can direct you to your local alcohol services."" Support may include home-based and community detoxification programmes, counselling and group work. Friends and family also have a role to play. Friend and former England player Alan Shearer has said: ""It wont be easy, but he [Gazza] needs to dig deep and find the energy and the will to do it. ""What he needs to know most of all is that he is loved.""",{},"['living', 'rogers', 'work', 'stop', 'alcoholic', 'need', 'alcohol', 'thats', 'grip', 'drinking', 'addiction', 'drink']","Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

Sex addiction: 'Five times a day wasn't enough',Two sex addicts speak about the impact it has had on their lives.,,2018-05-01 23:28:50+00:00,BBC News,"Image caption Rebecca Barker said sex addiction took over her life and ruined her relationship Sex addiction divides expert opinion, but for some people it is a very real condition that can be shameful and even ""life-destroying"". As relationship charity Relate calls for help to be made available on the NHS, two sufferers speak about the impact it has had on their lives. ""At its worst, even having sex five times a day wasnt enough."" Mother-of-three Rebecca Barker said the compulsion took over her life in 2014 and ruined her relationship. Her addiction meant she was constantly asking her partner for sex. ""It was literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up, I just couldnt get it off my mind,"" said the 37-year-old, originally from Tadcaster in North Yorkshire. ""I felt like everything reminded me of it. I think it was linked to my depression and the lack of serotonin. I felt like my whole body was craving it. ""It was giving me the instant hit and five minutes later I wanted it again. ""I became a hermit, I stayed at home because I felt ashamed that it was all I could think about. Even though no-one could read my mind, it still felt very uncomfortable for me to be around other people."" Image copyright Rebecca Barker Image caption Ms Barker split with her partner and made lifestyle changes in a bid to control her addiction Ms Barkers addiction caused serious problems in her relationship. Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple. ""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldnt understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from. ""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and thats why I wanted sex with him."" In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother. ""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that. ""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything."" Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France. ""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said. What is sex addiction?

""When you are in full-blown addiction you are obsessed with thinking about it - from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep. ""It was a horrible, gross experience - there is nothing sexy about it. When you wake up in the morning with a dose of chlamydia, it is not sexy. ""It is damaging and life-destroying.""

""What started with one affair at work led to another - but unlike most office affairs which may stem from one partner being unhappily married, mine was an addiction which I had to feed each day. ""You have one affair and then you want another and another one. ""I soon realised that the quickest and most convenient way for me to feed my addiction was to pay for it. I would be seeing escorts, sex workers, three or four times per week. ""It is just like being an alcoholic, its a cycle that builds up in your mind - you feel a high from thinking about how it might happen and then you act it out in the way you planned.

Gazza rehab: Paul Gascoigne reveals US clinic drama,Football star Paul Gascoigne reveals he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab in the US.,,10 March 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Concerns for Gascoignes wellbeing were raised again earlier this year Football star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab. The former England midfielder has flown back to the UK after more than a month at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, that specialises in treating alcoholism. The 45-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he heard three doctors conclude he was going to pass away, before he slipped into a three-day coma. His life was saved, but Gascoigne said: ""I thought I was on my way out."" Fresh fears for the health of Gascoigne, who has battled against alcoholism for several years, emerged at a public appearance in Northampton in January. Total wreck Within days, he had been flown to the private clinic in the US and Gascoigne - nicknamed Gazza - said he begged its doctors at the clinic to save his life as he went through the detox process. Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink Organise their lifestyle around drinking Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol ""Three doctors didnt think I would make it,"" he said. ""It has got to inspire me to never let this happen again. Ive come through that - death. I was dead."" He added: ""I thought I was on my way out. I looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck."" Gascoigne, whose football clubs included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton, has had a long-term battle against alcohol addiction. He said his latest problems started in Dubai last summer when he started drinking alcohol again after 17 months ""dry"". The ex-footballer said he followed that by staying off alcohol for the following six months, but his own despair at his lapse meant that he failed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and isolated himself, barely eating. ""I was living like a dry drunk,"" he said. Eventually, he succumbed and started drinking heavily again, a situation which came to public attention at the Northampton charity event when he broke down sobbing on stage. On his admission to the US treatment centre, Gascoignes management company said he was alcoholic with ""complex issues"" which were being dealt with by professionals. It has since emerged that the public appearance could still raise thousands of pounds for charity. Gascoigne said he had no recollection of being there. Another chance Gascoignes drinking problems started during his playing days - he was admitted to the Priory Hospital, near Southampton, in 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl. Three years later, while playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith.

Peter Holder jailed for 1988 rape of woman,A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago is jailed.,,12 September 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright Police Image caption Peter Holder admitted the charges at Reading Crown Court last month A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago has been jailed for 11 and a half years after a review linked his DNA to the crime. Peter Holder was 22 when he grabbed the 30-year-old woman in Reading and raped her in a car park. He drove her two miles before letting her go. Holder, 48, from Tippett Rise, pleaded guilty in August to rape. Reading Crown Court heard Holder was jailed for three years and four months in 2010 for another historical crime. Holder pleaded guilty to an attempted rape he committed 1987 - five months before the Reading attack - following another cold case review. Frightened to go out Holder, who also admitted indecent assault and kidnap in relation to the 1988 attack, was only arrested in May this year when modern technology identified DNA found on the woman belonged to him. Judge Joanna Cutts said the delay was caused either because of the technology at the time not identifying the DNA or because there had been no match found at the time.

The shocking legacies of Nazi medical research,"Our pick of the week from around the web, including why Hitler's victims still haunt modern science and the video game designer rewriting the rules of chess.",Robert Cottrell,2013-11-09 00:00:00,,"The hidden technology that makes Twitter huge Paul Ford | Business Week | 7 November 2013 Twitter thrives for two main reasons. First, it’s cunningly engineered: The visible Tweet contains up to 140 characters, but each message also has 31 hidden data fields which allow Twitter to analyse and monetise network activity. Second, it has uncovered value in “a latent aspect of human life”, something that humans produce freely and plentifully, but which was previously seen as worthless: trivial chatter. The Nazi anatomists Emily Bazelon | Slate | 6 November 2013 Remarkable – and often repugnant – piece of writing and reporting on the legacies of Nazi medical research. Anatomists accepted the bodies of thousands killed by Hitler’s regime; German, Austrian, Polish universities still hold remains in their collections. Nazi theories recur even now in America’s abortion debate. Half of Germany’s doctors joined the Nazi Party; almost all continued practising after the war. Bitcoin Is broken Emin Gün Sirer & Ittay Eyal | Hacking Distributed | 4 November 2013 Researchers claim to have discovered a fundamental flaw in Bitcoin which could enable dishonest miners to hijack the currency. “The Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. The protocol can be gamed by people with selfish interests. And once the system veers away from the happy mode where everyone is honest, there is no force that opposes the growth of really large pools that command control of the currency.” In praise of the polymath Robert Twigger | Aeon | 4 November 2013 We overvalue specialists in the intellectual world, and undervalue generalists — perhaps because the division of labour has worked well in the business world. But skilled polymaths are happier and more innovative. “Over-specialisation eventually retreats into defending what one has learnt rather than making new connections. The initial spurt of learning gives out, and the expert is left, like an animal, merely defending his territory.” What is theoretical physics, and why do it? Mark Jackson | The Conversation | 4 November 2013 A physicist explains. “Theoretical physicists construct theories of nature. For a theory to be true it must be both consistent with itself and consistent with nature. The first can be verified with mathematics, the second with experiment. Scientific exploration is like geographical exploration. Popular lore can be sometimes dramatically overturned, like the interdiction against sailing too far away, lest you fall off the edge of the world.” Why Russia’s drinkers resist AA Leon Neyfakh | Boston Globe | 3rd November 2013 Russia has a colossal drinking problem. Alcoholics Anonymous has shown the power of mutual support groups to combat alcoholism. Yet AA has made almost no headway in Russia: there are four times as many AA groups in Boston as in the whole of Russia. Why? Because Russians don’t think drinking is wrong, and they have low levels of trust. “The idea that another drunk can help you is asinine to most Russians.” Chess 2: The sequel Christian Donlan | Eurogamer | 3 November 2013 Video-game designer revises the rules of chess to reduce the proportion of draws. “The new victory condition is the simplest, and most immediately satisfying, part of Chess 2. While games still often hinge on good old checkmates, you can now also win if you manage to get your king across the middle of the board. It’s bold stuff when you see it in action: a proper NFL touchdown in the midst of a chess game!” Review: Basic Structures of Reality, by Colin McGinn Kerry McKenzie | Mind | 31 October 2013 Philosopher’s attempt to learn and analyse fundamental physics receives one of the most hostile book reviews ever published: “An impressively inept contribution to the philosophy of physics, and one exemplifying everything that can possibly go wrong with metaphyics; it is mind-numbingly repetitive, toe-curlingly pretentious, and amateurish in the extreme regarding the incorporation of physical fact.” (PDF) Paul Graham and Y Combinator Robert Greene | 30 October 2013 Graham was already wealthy from having built and sold an online commerce start-up, when he gave a talk at Harvard in 2005 and was besieged by students wanting to know how to turn their ideas into businesses. From which came another business plan: he would find ten outstanding start-up ideas by advertising, and invest $15,000 in each. His incubator has since launched companies worth almost $14 billion.

你是不是工作狂？回答几个问题就知道,超时工作和无法控制想要工作的欲望并非一回事，但二者界限何在？怎样才知道自己是不是工作狂？如何确诊“工作成瘾”症状？,,2016年 11月 4日,BBC 英伦网,Image copyright Image caption （图片来源：Alamy） 所有人都喜欢努力工作的员工。 事实上，多工作、多赚钱已经被很多人视作现代社会成功的标志。能被贴上工作狂的标签更是被许多人视为一种荣誉。 但对某些人来说，着迷于工作却需要付出很多代价。健康、人际关系甚至工作质量都会受到影响——代价不可谓不高。 无论如何，强烈的工作欲望多年来已经导致很多人向治疗师和自助团体寻求帮助。这甚至会引发过劳死。日本政府本月早些时候发布的一项研究显示，五分之一的日本职场人士面临过劳死的风险。 过劳死不只是日本的问题。工作狂互戒会（Workaholics Anonymous）效仿嗜酒者互戒会（Alcoholics Anonymous）的做法制定了12步法则，他们于今年6月在英国举行了首届国际大会，吸引了来自世界各地的与会者出席。 关于工作狂的成因，目前还没有太多的相关研究。但这种现状正在改变——最近几年，这种现象开始获得更多关注，人们也不再仅仅把它当成一个流行词来看待。 Image caption “工作狂”并不是一种正式的疾病——但它绝不仅仅是一个流行词（图片来源：Getty Images） 美国精神病学协会的精神疾病诊断与统计手册是诊断精神疾病的黄金法则，但工作狂却并未被其认可为一种疾病。 然而，尽管没有精确的定义，但工作狂对人们产生的影响却有可能与健康、职业和心理问题存在关联，而研究人员也在关注此事。乔治亚大学最近开展的元分析——对现有的工作狂研究文献展开定量总结——显示，与工作态度和工作方法更为健康的同事相比，工作狂的效率反而更低。 挪威卑尔根大学今年5月发布的一项大型研究将工作狂倾向与其他精神病问题关联起来，包括强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症。 工作成瘾 如果努力工作对你产生了负面影响该怎么办？哪些迹象能让人们确认自己“工作成瘾”？北卡罗来纳州精神治疗师布莱恩·罗宾逊（Bryan Robinson）表示，工作狂是一种强烈的冲动——它令人们难以摆脱工作的意愿和想法。罗宾逊曾经对工作成瘾的影响展开过早期研究，还写了一本名为《拴在办公桌上》（Chained to the Desk）的工作狂指导手册。 “工作狂不是根据工作时间来定义的，而是要考虑我们内心的想法。”他说。 “工作狂在滑雪时想着回去工作。而健康的人则是在工作时想着去滑雪。” 罗宾逊的客户里就有一些人因为长时间加班而离婚、失业或者遭遇健康问题。他回忆道，有一位客户曾经骗自己的丈夫说她在健身房，但她实际上却是在工作，之后再换上运动装，用水浸透全身，让自己看上去像是满身是汗。 Image caption 工作冲动强的人未必能比怀有健康态度的人绩效更高（图片来源：Getty Images） 你身边是否也有类似的人？ 但乔治亚大学的元分析显示，与其他同事相比，工作狂的业绩未必最好，在办公室里的活跃度也未必很高。 作为这项研究的负责人，乔治亚大学工业和组织心理学教授玛丽莎·克拉克（Malissa A Clark）表示，工作狂的职场压力更大，工作满意度和生活满意度更低，也更易疲惫。 危险信号 卑尔根工作成瘾量表（Bergen Work Addiction Scale）使用7项基本标准来判断工作成瘾的程度，每个标准有以下5个选项：（1）从不，（2）很少，（3）有时，（4）经常，（5）总是。如果在7项标准中至少有4项选择“经常”或“总是”，你可能就是工作狂。 你心想如何才能多腾出一些时间来工作。 你的实际工作时间远超最初的计划。 你为了降低负罪感、焦虑感、无助感和抑郁感而工作。 别人曾经建议你减少工作时间，但你却置之不理。 如果无法工作，你会感到紧张。你因为工作而放弃业余爱好、休闲活动和体育锻炼。 你工作量太大，甚至连身体健康都受到了负面影响。 Image caption 由于你无法立刻戒掉工作，所以必须制定一项计划，控制好自己与工作之间的关系（图片来源：Getty Images） 这些人的工作与生活之间的冲突更大，身体和心理健康度更低，包括婚姻在内的家庭关系也受到了不利影响。 她补充道，尽管工作狂经常与上进心、竞争欲、有野心和高效率联系在一起，但实际上，“积极影响并不多。” 评估与求助 如果你认为自己可能有问题，可以通过一些方法进行自我评估。 挪威研究人员制作的卑尔根工作成瘾量表可以帮助你对自己工作时的行为、感受和态度进行衡量。工作狂互戒会也会提供一份在线问卷，可以帮助你判断自己是否需要寻求帮助。 专家表示，第一步是承认自己有问题。 罗宾逊自称是一个处在恢复期的工作狂，他的治疗手段包括正念、心理治疗、改变行为和揭露根本问题。“这种情况存在一些根本原因。有的时候是自尊，有的时候是一种调节焦虑的方法。”他说。 Image caption （图片来源：Getty Images） 61岁的鲍勃承认他存在这方面的问题。妻子告诉他，她已经受够了现在的生活：她经常半夜醒来发现丈夫不在身边，而是在办公室里加班。鲍勃是工作狂互戒会的外联主任，这是一项志愿工作。为了避免别人暴露身份，他拒绝在这篇报道中使用自己的全名 “让工作狂上瘾的‘药物’就是肾上腺素。”他说，“紧张、压力、危机、最后期限，这都会使人兴奋，让人分泌肾上腺素，从而拼命地工作。” 鲍勃5岁时就开始工作了——帮助哥哥送报纸、回收易拉罐和玻璃瓶、修剪草坪、铲除积雪。他后来成了一名成功的商人，但健康状况却每况愈下。他表示，如果不向专业人士求助，他的家庭生活就会遭到破坏。他的妻子已经受够了这种生活。 “正是因为她受够了这样的生活，我才下定决心参加这个项目。”鲍勃说。 但跟吃饭一样，工作不可能一下子就完全放弃。既然如此，又该如何控制不停工作的冲动呢？“应该制定一份计划，然后按照计划行事，而不是随时强迫自己处理所有事情。”鲍勃说。这意味着要安排好工作时间，每次只能集中精力做一件事情。如果有其他事情突然出现，不能手忙脚乱地同时处理所有事情，而应该查看计划，并重新确定优先顺序。 其他的治疗方案还包括寻找精通这一领域的治疗师。或者，也可以参加门诊研讨会和门诊项目。而现在还出现了一些住院治疗项目，例如美国俄亥俄州的The Bridge To Recovery就计划为工作狂提供帮助，同时辅以强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症等方面的其他治疗。 但克拉克表示，目前的治疗方案之所以匮乏，主要原因是缺乏相关研究。“关于工作狂起因的研究本身就不多，而关于工作狂与临床症状相互关系的研究更是几乎没有。”挪威的研究算是其中之一。 她表示，现在需要进行更多的研究，“这样才能让这个问题变得更加主流，而不再是小众的流行词。这的确会对人们的生活和幸福构成明确的负面影响。” 访问 BBC Capital 阅读 英文原文。,{},"['caption',

Clark）表示，工作狂的职场压力更大，工作满意度和生活满意度更低，也更易疲惫。危险信号卑尔根工作成瘾量表（Bergen Work Addiction Scale）使用7项基本标准来判断工作成瘾的程度，每个标准有以下5个选项：（1）从不，（2）很少，（3）有时，（4）经常，（5）总是。如果在7项标准中至少有4项选择“经常”或“总是”，你可能就是工作狂。你心想如何才能多腾出一些时间来工作。你的实际工作时间远超最初的计划。你为了降低负罪感、焦虑感、无助感和抑郁感而工作。别人曾经建议你减少工作时间，但你却置之不理。如果无法工作，你会感到紧张。你因为工作而放弃业余爱好、休闲活动和体育锻炼。你工作量太大，甚至连身体健康都受到了负面影响。Image

Bridge To Recovery就计划为工作狂提供帮助，同时辅以强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症等方面的其他治疗。但克拉克表示，目前的治疗方案之所以匮乏，主要原因是缺乏相关研究。“关于工作狂起因的研究本身就不多，而关于工作狂与临床症状相互关系的研究更是几乎没有。”挪威的研究算是其中之一。她表示，现在需要进行更多的研究，“这样才能让这个问题变得更加主流，而不再是小众的流行词。这的确会对人们的生活和幸福构成明确的负面影响。”访问

'Why I drink 100 units of alcohol a week',Heavy drinkers share their boozing habits - including spending £500 a month on wine.,,2018-08-21 16:26:29+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images How much alcohol do you drink? People have been sharing their drinking habits after presenter Adrian Chiles revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week - more than seven times the recommended limit. He said drinking never affects his life and he considers himself a social drinker, not an alcoholic. Other heavy drinkers have been speaking about their alcohol consumption. Do I want to stop? No Paul Tomlinson, 48, from Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire says it is ""easy to rack up drinking when youre sat at home"". ""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday. ""On each night I will usually have two or three beers - sometimes alcohol free now actually - followed by a bottle of wine and then two or three large gin and tonics. ""This is roughly 16 to 18 units a night for three consecutive nights. I will then do at least two or three more bottles of wine in the week with a couple of gin and tonics again. Image copyright Paul Tomlinson Image caption Paul Tomlinson says society primes people to drink alcohol ""Do I consider myself an alcoholic? No! Do I want to stop drinking at the level I do? Not really. ""I have a disabled son who is 24 so dont go out often and as a result drink more at home. ""I dont go to bed feeling outrageously drunk and I dont black out on the sofa."" £500 a month on wine One man, who chose to remain anonymous, says his father was an ""old fashioned"" alcoholic who started drinking in the morning - but that he is not an alcoholic. ""I find myself in the habit of putting away one and a half to two bottles of white wine every night, unless Im really thirsty in which case it might be two and a half bottles. ""I start at 6 or 7pm, couple of glasses whilst preparing family supper, continue through PS4 ""wind down"" time, another couple of glasses. ""Then usually finish off the second bottle whilst listening to music. Tada! £500 a month on wine. ""Im in a strange position, as I can (and do) stop when I want to - sometimes for a month or two just to prove to myself Im not an alcoholic like my dad. ""Ill go out with my mates and not touch a drop, again - just to prove a point to myself. And yet I still drink far, far too much. Image copyright Getty Images ""Im rarely drunk nowadays, although obviously I still dont drive. I just wish someone would make a drink that tastes as nice as wine, without the alcohol. ""Im currently losing weight and so have ""limited"" myself to a half to one bottle of wine a night. ""I find that the problem is the habit more than alcohol. I smoked 20 plus a day for 20 years then quit five years ago, with no patches etc. ""Never felt like a relapse, never been tempted to have just one. I think alcohol is in the same category. ""Although, as I can testify with my father, the drug is insidious and rather than just kill your body, if you let it, it will kill your personality first."" Im all or nothing Adrian Chiles account of his alcohol consumption ""mirrors almost exactly"" how Mark Baker, 58, from North Somerset, says he drinks. ""Like him I drink about 80 to 100 units a week and have done so for many years. ""I have a slight fatty liver (as does he) but otherwise perfectly OK. I have never suffered from depression or anxiety. ""I drink mostly out of habit. I never get drunk, drink and drive, I never drink in the mornings or at lunchtime, I just like a drink in the evening to wind down and relax. ""I am an export manager so drinking is part of the territory. Image copyright Getty Images ""Last year in October I stopped drinking for a month. I was worried that I was dependent on it. ""I found it easy to do especially as there are so many products on the market with low or no alcohol. I could still have a beer, glass of wine or even a gin and tonic. Yes, there is low alcohol spirit. ""Like Adrian, I will probably give up drinking rather than rationing it as when I have tried that in the past it never seems to work. I am definitely an all or nothing person."" I will try and cut down Annemarie McAleese, 48, from Belfast, owns her own restaurant and says she starts drinking wine when she gets home as she ""potters about"". ""On average I would drink two bottles of white wine each night, and have done for the last seven years. ""I have my own business, and work in it five or six days per week. ""After reading this article, I think now is the time to rethink my drinking habits. ""Its a very bad habit. I think I will try to cut down. I think I use owning my business as an excuse because it can be quite stressful. ""I wont watch the programme with my husband because I dont need somebody yapping in my ear you need to stop, I need to do this for myself."" High functioning alcoholic John, from Essex, says he considered himself a ""moderate social drinker"" until he developed liver disease. ""Then I gave up drinking altogether but the liver disease worsened leading to many hospital visits and the need for a liver transplant. ""I had never missed work or put drink ahead of all else but when I detailed out my daily drinking to numerous doctors over a nine-month period I was embarrassed to realise that I was effectively a high-functioning alcoholic. ""I am pleased to say that thanks to my organ donor I have led a healthy, happy life for the last eight years and become a grandfather three times. ""Something I would have missed if I had carried on as before. Image caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week. ""If Adrians show makes anyone seriously look at the amount they drink and reduce it then he is doing a great job. ""On the subject of giving up alcohol I feel sometimes too much is made of how difficult this is, rather than concentrating on the benefits of being sober. ""Better health, better sleep, no hangovers, higher alertness and an ability to enjoy things with a clear head."" Alcohol and health The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week. If you do drink that much, it is best to spread it over three or more days. One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units. Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.

The girl who's banned from buying booze,"She's been called everything from a menace to a hellraiser. She's been followed around by camera crews, the tabloid press and groups have been started about her on Facebook.",,None,,"Shes been called everything from a menace to a hellraiser. Shes been followed around by camera crews, the tabloid press and groups have been started about her on Facebook. Laura Hall from Bromsgrove in the Midlands is not the latest X Factor wannabe or a World Cup WAG. The 20-year-old is famous for being the first person to be banned from buying alcohol anywhere in England and Wales. ""I am terrible when Ive had a drink,"" she told Newsbeat. ""Alcohol is my best friend and my worst enemy."" Laura had a lot going for her when she left school in 2006; a good group of friends, a supportive family and a batch of GCSEs. Five years later shes had just one real job as a shop assistant. It fell through and shes still living in her parents large detached house outside Birmingham and claiming unemployment benefit. ""I would never dream of going out for the evening without a drink,"" she said. ""The first time I got arrested I was drinking down the park with my friends when a policeman came over and took the alcohol off us. ""We saw him later in the night and nicked his helmet from the police car."" Since then she has been arrested dozens of times for alcohol-related offences and spent time in a young offenders centre in Bristol. Cant go on In April a judge, frustrated at Lauras 25th appearance in court, gave her the UKs first Drinking Banning Order. ""You are going to drink yourself to death before long,"" he said at the time. ""You cant go on behaving like this in public."" I am getting help on probation and I really want to try Alcoholics Anonymous again. It makes me feel really guilty Laura Hall Drinking Banning Orders, or Booze Asbos as they are nicknamed by the tabloid press, were brought in by the old Labour government last year. If Laura buys alcohol from any bar, club or off licence in England and Wales, or carries open bottles around on the street she is now breaking the law. Not that the ban has really curbed Lauras drinking. She spent last weekend in custody after knocking back vodka, lying in the middle of the road and abusing the police and ambulance staff who came to help her. Getting help ""I think it has made me cut down a bit but it hasnt stopped me,"" she said. ""Something absolutely major would have to happen to make me give up."" Laura now admits she needs help. Theres talk of rehab paid for by a tabloid newspaper or by the camera crew which is now following her about for a television documentary. ""I am getting help on probation and I really want to try Alcoholics Anonymous again,"" she said. ""It makes me feel really guilty. I have put alcohol before everything and everybody in my life."" But with Lauras 21st birthday just a few weeks away there is little of chance of her quitting just yet. She is already planning a trip away to Crete with her mates next month. ""I am going on holiday and, Im not going to lie, its not going to be an orange juice holiday,"" she said. ""But its not going to be a massive bender, its going to be one night out and the rest of it will be a quiet holiday. ""And after that Im going to get serious.""",{},"['really', 'whos', 'shes', 'help', 'buying', 'tabloid', 'alcohol', 'banned', 'girl', 'lauras', 'try', 'going', 'drinking', 'booze', 'drink']","She's been followed around by camera crews, the tabloid press and groups have been started about her on Facebook.

9/11: The 73 minutes that changed my life,"Like thousands of others, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes has changed his life in a profound way and will, he believes, continue to affect him until the day he dies.",,5 September 2011,BBC News,"Like thousands of other New Yorkers, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies. The moment he walked through the revolving doors of his office building and stepped on to the street on that sunny September morning, Artie Van Whys world shifted a few degrees on its axis. It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world His life from that instant took a different course, propelled by the mayhem that enveloped him that day, events the world later identified by two numbers, nine and 11. Millions of people watched on television as four hijacked planes crashed in the US, two of them into one famous New York landmark. But Van Why was in the thick of it. The experience forced him to leave New York, his home for 26 years, and move more than 100 miles west to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, deep in Amish country. Download the tablet version PDF download The 73 minutes that changed my life [655 KB] Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Ten years after the atrocities, sitting in the corner of a humble one-bedroom apartment located above a funeral home, his face is a picture of concentration as he recalls the days events. ""I remember it was a beautiful day. Whenever I see a really beautiful blue sky, it takes me back to that morning."" He was working as a clerical assistant at law firm Holland & Knight, and his office was on the 23rd floor of a building separated from the World Trade Center site only by Church Street and the Millennium Hilton hotel. At 08:46, a loud boom shook the building. A colleague asked if it was thunder, then someone screamed for everyone to get out of the building, because a plane had hit one of the twin towers. Expecting to see a small aircraft sticking out of the famous skyscraper, Van Why took the lift to the ground floor and exited through a revolving door. ""It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world. It seemed as everything slowed down and it was going frame by frame as if in slow motion. ""All these white paper sheets were covering the ground like snow and coming down. I remember thinking that Id never seen so much paper. ""I walked a short distance to Church Street where the towers were and thats when I saw the North Tower for the first time. I was dumbstruck. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing. ""There was a huge black hole, the flames were bright orange and the smoke was billowing out of the tower."" More people were arriving on the streets, he says, and sirens could be heard in the background. As his recollections become more vivid, the 58-year-old closes his eyes and rocks back and forth in his orange armchair, his right foot tapping the carpet vigorously. His rented apartment is full of reminders of what he went through. A photo of the World Trade Center is on the fridge, and other photographs featuring the famous Manhattan skyline adorn the living room, like pictures of a deceased member of the family. Image caption Reminders of the life left behind fill his apartment One wall is full of framed newspaper cuttings, reviews of the play that Van Why - a former actor - wrote and performed about 9/11. And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real. ""I dont know how long I was looking at the North Tower, trying to take it all in. I was transfixed. What broke it was when I realised there were other things falling, there were people falling and everyone realised at the same time. ""People started screaming and my reaction was to scream No, No, No! at the thought that people were falling down. And thats when - I dont know why I reacted in this way - but my instinct was to run towards them. I remember shouting out God, save us all! ""I ran to the plaza where they were falling. I didnt have a moments thought, I just ran towards the tower, thinking Can I help these people? I imagined them laying there and the thought of being able to hold their hand or sit and be with them, comfort them."" Another man was running with him, and for a moment, the two stopped and stood side by side, taking in the enormity of what they were seeing - human beings jumping to their deaths. Van Why recalls seeing bodies piling up on the ground. ""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling. Somehow I had thought that if you ever jumped from a high place, you would be dead before you hit the ground. ""But I remember seeing how very much alive he was and I can still see his arms and legs moving as if to brace himself. Fortunately I didnt see him hit."" Some guards shouted for the two men to come to safety through another World Trade Center Building, number 5. They went down a lift and out of the site on to Church Street, from where Van Why saw the second plane hit the South Tower, only 17 minutes after the first. Pandemonium broke out. Debris was raining down, he says, as he ran towards Fulton Street, at one point falling to the ground. ""People started to run over the top of me and I thought I was going to be trampled to death but I managed to get up. I remember shouting out God, save us all!"" He recalls an African-American woman tripping and being helped to her feet by a businessman. Then he ran past a large man who was lying face down in the street. Getting down on his knees, Van Why saw that the man had a serious head injury. He appeared to have been hit by a putty knife that had fallen from one of the buildings and was lying nearby stained with blood. ""Another man stopped and gave me a denim jacket which we put over the open wound and then I remember seeing his watch on the street beside him and I put it in his pants [trouser] pocket. We turned him over and he had a work tag with a name."" With tears falling and his voice cracking, Van Why goes on: ""My biggest regret is that I didnt look to his tag to see what the name was. I could have found his family and told them that there were people with him."" An ambulance arrived and it required several people to lift the man on to the stretcher. Van Why stroked his arm and told him he would be fine. Realising he had left his mobile phone in the office, he began asking strangers if he could borrow one to get the message through to his parents that he was OK. But none of the phones were working, so he went into a cafe and used a telephone there. When he emerged, he heard a deafening sound. He looked to his left and saw a wall of grey smoke coming towards him. The South Tower was collapsing. For the second time that morning, he started running. The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower. By the time he got to his apartment on 43rd Street, after deliberately avoiding the area around the Empire State Building, it was approaching noon. The North Tower had also collapsed, but Van Why had been far enough away to not hear it. To see the enhanced content on this page, you need to have JavaScript enabled and Adobe Flash installed. In the days that followed, he slept only fitfully and always with the bedroom light on. ""I was afraid of the dark. It never happened before 9/11. It was a sense of security having that light on. ""For that first week I would wake up early and call my parents first thing. I would be on the phone crying with them. There was a lot of crying that week.

And still an incomprehension, trying to understand what had happened."" He avoided watching television or reading newspapers because he could not bear to see replays or photos of the planes striking the towers. He had his own images, pictures inside his head, sometimes appearing with a clarity that transported him back to the mayhem. He discovered that two men who lived in his apartment building were missing and a lawyer at work who was last seen running towards the towers was also presumed dead. Van Why had done exactly the same and survived. As a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for two years, he already had a therapist, and in the weeks following 9/11 he saw him daily. Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were also an opportunity to share his feelings with others, but he lived alone and had no partner to provide constant support. Before long he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Holland & Knight opened makeshift offices at a hotel in Midtown but he did not feel able to go back to work until two or three weeks after the attacks. When he did, it was the first time he had ventured outside his neighbourhood. A few days later, he rented a car and drove to Maryland, for a 30-year high school reunion. The sight of an aeroplane coming into land caused him to burst into tears. At the event, when he introduced himself by saying: ""Im from the greatest city in the world, New York City,"" people stood up and applauded. His old offices near Ground Zero were soon ready again, but Van Why found returning to the scene too harrowing to endure. The smell of smoke from the still-smouldering site would fill his nostrils as he emerged from the subway. The WTC plaza - once his lunchtime sanctuary - now resembled to him a grave. One morning, the police allowed him to enter the site so he could lay six roses on what he regarded as ""hallowed ground"". In November 2001, he resigned from work after 13 years of service. It was too painful to continue. He instead focused on his new project - writing his own story about his experience. I was out of the country and didnt get back to New York City until the end of October. I was in touch with Artie, aware of his proximity, but didnt fully understand the impact on him until I got home. It was unravelling. It could only be unravelling. No-one should have to witness something like that. In survival mode, he knew he no longer could stay in NYC. His family, which had always been a strong connection in his life, would provide a sense of comfort and familiarity he desperately needed. He moved out of the city and regrouped. It took time. Through his grief and pain he also found a creative outlet. He was able to process his grief by writing about it. He had written emails to family and friends following the attacks, to explain what happened, and they forwarded his story to other people. Soon he began to receive appreciative emails from strangers. Encouraged, he began to develop his story into a script, convinced it was his mission to keep the memory alive. It became a one-man play that he performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles. ""The play gave me a sense of purpose. Those two years after 9/11, when I was really focused on my play, that is the only time in my life I felt fulfilled, because I had a purpose and I thought I was doing something important and something selfless, because I was doing it for the memory of the people I saw die."" After each performance, some people would tell him their own story of where they were, making him realise, he says, that people across the US had a story of 9/11. He was hoping he could continue performing the show for at least five years. ""I wanted to dedicate my life to it. But it closed in New York earlier than planned, the major papers ignored it and some reviews were critical, saying I was trying to profit out of it."" It seemed to him like the city was ready to move on and he was not. The spirit that defined New York in the days, weeks and months afterwards had gone, he says, and he felt a bit like a ""lone crusader"". Image caption Van Why performed his play in 2003 ""It still weighed so heavily on my emotions and who I was, so to see other people werent doing that and moving on, it was like How can they be doing that? ""There was anger and a feeling of isolation. In the month after 9/11, it was all you talked about with strangers, but two years afterwards, there was a sense that OK, you dont need to talk about this any more."" Immersing himself for years in writing and performing the play probably held him back, he admits, because he was dwelling on the events and re-living them, but not dealing with the emotions. That process did not begin until he moved. In September 2003, he started a new life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because he wanted to be near his parents. ""I never thought I would leave New York, I envisaged my last days would be in New York but it just seemed like the right thing to do."" He felt guilty about leaving, but the pull of family was overwhelming and he felt like he had nowhere else to go. ""All of a sudden I just needed to be closer to them, I wanted it and needed it. For me and my parents, the reality that 9/11 was a day that I could have died brought the importance of being with my family to me. ""Though I was in my 50s, there was a sense that I needed mummy and daddy, that sense of security and that sense of home."" Growing up, home was Gaithersburg in Maryland, where the young Van Why was a quiet boy, according to his parents. Thelma and Art Van Why His parents endured a terrifying few hours on 11 Sept 2001 while they waited for news Relief at hearing he was OK turned to despair as they watched their son spiral into depression But in 2003, he moved to be near to them both ""Were so happy that hes moved because we became closer. Its a big change,"" says Thelma. ""But to see your own child go through that, you wonder what you can do to help."" ""He was in his own little shell, his own little world and we would try to comfort him as much as we could,"" says Art. ""We just told him we were here for him. So its really helped me to know hes starting to come round."" He says he felt different from other children - he later realised he was gay - and was bullied. After high school, he attended a small, conservative Christian college, where he majored first in Bible studies, then in drama. He moved to New York in 1977 with the dream of becoming an actor but after struggling for 10 years to get sustained work in the theatre, he gave it up. The clerical work that had been a supplement to his income became his main and only job. As a young man, hed had a difficult relationship with his parents and throughout his adult life he had seen them only three or four times a year. It was not until he moved to Pennsylvania, two years after the attacks, that his relationship with them, in his own words, ""fully healed"". ""I didnt know what it would entail, moving here, but eight years later, my relationship with my parents is incredible. It has a depth and appreciation it has never had before."" When he arrived in 2003, he didnt have a job, an apartment or a car, and he left many long-standing friendships behind in New York. And there was no-one who could relate to what he had been through. After the bright lights of Manhattan, the small city of Lancaster - with fewer than 60,000 residents and a homespun, rural charm - struck a tranquil note. Van Why withdrew socially, spending a lot of time in what he calls his ""cave"", a room where he would just watch television endlessly at weekends. Even when he was coaxed out of his isolation by colleagues for a coffee, he was lost and distracted. A low period at the end of last year, when he was often breaking down, was his grief finally being released, he believes. ""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it. The person I was on September 10th, that person is no longer. I had to go through a very emotional period which enabled me to go and face Ground Zero."" In the last few months he has started to come out of his metaphorical cave. The first step on the road to recovery was going back to New York in April, for the first time since he left in 2003. With his parents and sister Sue by his side, he visited the place that had haunted him for nearly a decade. ""That was a huge step for me. It was very emotional but it helped to put an end to that chapter of my life. Even though I had been away for eight years, there was guilt that I had left my city when it was still healing."" Only having closed that door, could he start to regard Lancaster as home, he says. Shortly after that trip, he met someone and began a relationship. ""Being with him, I realised that I had forgotten what it was like to be happy. Its like I am stepping back into life. Im finally moving past mourning."" But there are other struggles. He has two jobs, one in the box office of the Fulton Theatre in Lancaster, and another as a cashier in a Weis supermarket. The two incomes combined earn him about $20,000 (£12,196) a year, about $50,000 (£30,494) less than he was earning in New York. I witnessed the goodness of man ""I dont believe I had witnessed the wrath of anyones God that morning. What I had been a witness to when I looked up at those burning towers was the ultimate evil that man is capable of. The evidence of just how deep hatred could run, how far it could go. But I had also been a witness to something else that day - down on the ground. I witnessed the ultimate goodness of man, the evidence of how strong courage could be, to what lengths it would go. I believe God was in the hands of everyone who reached out to someone else. He was in the arms of people on the streets as they embraced one another. He was in the tears of strangers who cried together. He was in all the lives that were given in the line of duty, in the acts of heroism. He was in the hearts of the people across the country who, as they watched the horror from afar, felt compassion."" That Day In September Its a thorn in his side, he says. ""I have debts and try to pay them off when I can and meet my basic expenses. So far, Ive been lucky to just get by."" If he had been told in 2001 that in 10 years he would be living in Pennsylvania and working in a theatre and a supermarket, he would have been shocked. ""I liked my job. I liked working down there. And, yes, I was making a good salary. I would like to think I might have developed a relationship with someone. ""At the time of 9/11, I was in the best place I had been for a long time - sober and happy. Perhaps I would have been able to take vacations and travel, things Im unable to do now."" And the images are still there every day, sometimes popping into his head without warning, with such force that he zones out while his mind revisits the carnage. ""They are like snippets of a movie. I will replay watching this one man who I saw falling, watching him. I will flash to the injured man I saw laying in the streets. Its a series of vignettes that my mind just goes back to."" A siren is enough to take him back there and its a sound that makes his body tighten. He still has not boarded a plane, although tall buildings dont instil in him the same fear they once did. A study by Cornell University suggests that the trauma suffered by witnesses like Van Why may have physically altered their brains, damaging their ability to process emotions. He says 9/11 survivors and witnesses like himself are the ""forgotten majority"", never considered among the victims. What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was ""Theyre not letting any survivors to the [10th anniversary] ceremony in New York, its just bereaved family members. ""Theres a sense that you dont count. Some people are still struggling terribly, far worse than I am. Everyone who was there is still affected to a degree, but people dont remember us. ""Were not suffering physically and werent injured that day and didnt lose a family member. Its like we dont count."" Despite the financial and mental strains, he is now looking to the future with a new optimism. ""Its my life now and Ive never accepted that before. Thats another change in the past months. Not that I was fighting it before, but theres an acceptance, Im moving out of the mourning stage and back to life again."" Its comparable to losing a partner, he says, with the memory of that loved one never disappearing but gradually losing its hold. ""I cant imagine a day going by when I dont think about it, even as a passing thought. ""What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was and I think Im getting away from that now. My experience of 9/11 is part of who I am but not all of me."" Photographs by Adam Blenford",{},"['73', 'man', 'work', 'changed', 'play', 'life', 'york', 'saw', 'world', 'van', '911', 'day', 'minutes']","What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies.
And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real.
""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling.
The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower.
""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14439342

Chris Bevan: Andy Morrison's biggest battle,"I am halfway through my interview with Andy Morrison when I notice the mass of scars on his knuckles for the first time, testimony to the scrapes he was involved...",,None,,"I am halfway through my interview with Andy Morrison when I notice the mass of scars on his knuckles for the first time, testimony to the scrapes he was involved in during his colourful career. ""I had too many fights to put into my book,"" the former Manchester City, Huddersfield, Blackpool and Plymouth centre-back tells me of some of the brutal off-pitch tales which litter his new autobiography. ""So I just mentioned the ones which helped shape my career for better or worse."" An unashamed bruiser he may be, but Morrison does not glorify his violent past. In any case, his biggest battles have been psychological, not physical. In a week during which footballers mental health has been in the spotlight following Gary Speeds death, Morrisons story, which was published last month, makes poignant reading. Andy Morrison battled demons during and after his playing career. Photo: Getty Images As a player, he battled alcoholism and, at his lowest ebb in 1999, which actually coincided with some of his best times on the field with City, he considered taking his own life before vowing instead to ditch the drink. Morrison was the inspiration behind Citys promotion that year from what is now League One - a time when this weeks Champions League tie with Bayern Munich would have been unthinkable for his old club and one that seems light years away from their current status as mega-rich Premier League leaders. He has been on quite a journey himself. ""Its said that when you reach the pits of despair you turn within and ask for help,"" Morrison reflects. ""I was on my hands and knees when I looked at the sky and said please can you help me, I cannot take any more of this pain. Thankfully I got the support I needed from Alcoholics Anonymous and for almost 13 years I have not touched a drop."" But that was not the end of his problems. After injury curtailed his career in 2002 at the age of 32, Morrison faced financial ruin, while the chronic depression he has battled since hanging up his boots came because he missed the buzz of matchdays that had been part of his life since he was a young teenager. ""When you retire, there is a part of you where you keep a stiff upper lip,"" Morrison, now assistant manager at Evo-Stik League Premier Division side Northwich Victoria, explained over coffee in a leafy Cheshire village near his home. ""I was saying this is the next stage of my life, Im going to be positive. Im going to move on and get my coaching badges and all that sort of stuff. ""But I wasnt prepared in any way to deal with that huge void in my life. Id been a footballer from the age of 15 and I couldnt have been more institutionalised if I had been in the army. I loved competing. ""When I finished I went through a period of desolation. I had a desperate period of absolute uselessness for anything. Your confidence is affected and it is a downward spiral from there. I had absolutely nothing to look forward to. ""Its hard for footballers because, in so many aspects of your life, you are so much better off than other people but it is where you are in your head at that time that matters. I remember Stan Collymore being ridiculed for suffering from depression. John Gregory, his manager at Aston Villa, said how could someone earning £20,000 a week have it? ""But when you are suffering from chronic depression you dont go to a hole in the wall, stick your card in, look at your balance and see you have £200,000 in the bank and go thats it, I feel brilliant. Its much deeper than that. ""I think people are coming round to understanding it a bit more and hopefully there is no shame attached to it anymore. ""Thankfully for me, I dealt with my drinking problem and my addictive alcoholism before I retired. God only help me if I hadnt, because I only know for sure that I wouldnt be sat here with you talking because it would have just got darker and worse."" Morrison inspired Citys promotion from League One in 1999. Photo: Getty Images The good news for Morrison, and for those with similar problems, is that there was help out there then, and there still is now. We do not know the reasons for Speeds death but the debate over mental health in football has been ongoing since Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke took his own life in 2009 and Rushden & Diamonds goalkeeper Dale Roberts killed himself a year later. And despite the claims of Susannah Strong - author of a booklet on handling depression which the Professional Footballers Association sent out to ex-players in the wake of Speeds death - that ""there is no attention paid whatsoever to the mental health of footballers"", the reality is that there has been a support system in place for some time. Morrison, who was a warrior of a player known for inspiring team-mates and fans alike, feels Strong was right when she spoke of his condition being a taboo subject in football but says he was not left high and dry when he did reveal it and hopes others have the strength to do the same. ""There is a lot of support out there for footballers if they want to ask for it but when you are in such a desperate place it is hard to say Im really struggling with life and lower all your barriers and let your ego go,"" he added. ""I was the captain of every club I played for and I felt it was out of character to say I was struggling. ""When I did, I spoke to counsellors from Sporting Chance Clinic. They offered great help. I was given anti-depression tablets but there is no quick cure. For me, and I can only speak for me, there were no innate words of wisdom which were going to help me through it. Its a process and you have to be strong. You need all the help you can get. ""Anyone who suffers from it has to be brave enough to first recognise it - because that is the hardest thing - and then be willing to ask for help."" Morrison is in a better place now. Professionally, he is enjoying his job with Northwich and dreaming of coaching in the Premier League. Personally, he savours life with wife Paula and their three children. He has still not conquered all his demons, however. ""There are days when the black dog is at the bottom of the bed when I wake up,"" Morrison adds. ""He says good morning, Ive been waiting for you. There is nothing I can do to stop it happening, but now I know what to do when it does.""

Lars von Trier unsure over film future,Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.,,1 December 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright AP Image caption Born Lars Trier, he added the Von while at the National Film School of Denmark Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol. The controversial film-maker, whose films include Nymphomaniac and Breaking the Waves, revealed his concerns in an interview with Danish paper Politiken. He told the broadsheet he no longer drank a bottle of vodka a day or took ""narcotics"". ""I dont know whether I can make more films. And that haunts me,"" he said. ""No creative expression of artistic value has ever been carried out by former alcoholics and drug addicts,"" Von Trier told the newspaper. It was his first interview since Cannes Film Festival organisers banned him from their event in 2011 after he joked he was a Nazi at a news conference to promote his science fiction film Melancholia. Von Trier said he was 90 days sober on Sunday, adding he attended meetings at Alcoholics Anonymous every day. Palme dOr He was quoted by the newspaper as saying he used to drink a bottle of vodka every day but to be creative he combined the alcohol with different kinds of drugs. ""I cant recommend anyone to do the same. It is very dangerous and stupid in every way,"" he said. The director is perhaps best known as a co-signatory of the Dogme 95 manifesto - a ""vow of chastity"" he made with three fellow Danish film-makers. Their films, they declared, would strip away artifice by being shot on location using natural light and handheld cameras. In 2000 Von Trier won the Palme dOr with Dancer in the Dark, a musical starring Icelandic pop star Bjork as a woman who ends up on Death Row. His other films include Dogville, Manderlay and 2009s Antichrist, which whipped up a furore at Cannes with its explicit sex scenes and graphic violence. Von Triers most recent effort, the lengthy and sexually-explicit Nymphomaniac Directors Cut - Volume I and II, has been nominated for best film at the European Film Awards. The awards will be handed out on 13 December in Riga, Latvia, this years European Capital of Culture.

Activities offer hope to recovering addicts,People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.,,3 March 2011,BBC News,"Image caption More than 70 people have contacted AGRO at Holyhead and Bangor since last September People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night. The Anglesey and Gwynedd Recovery Organisation (AGRO) uses activities like gardening and group sessions to support people in their bid to give up drink and drugs. More than 70 people have already approached AGROs Holyhead and Bangor groups for help since it was set up last September, just through word of mouth recommendation. Its founders are now starting to publicise their work and have secured funding from the Safer Anglesey and Gwynedd partnerships to set up groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon. Huw Harries, who is a support worker for the dug and alcohol rehabilitation organisation CAIS by day, co-founded the charity in his spare time using his own funds. Image caption AGRO hope to soon launch groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon As a former alcoholic himself, Huw feels able to reach out to those who are also fighting to get sober. He said: ""I havent had a drink in 15 years. I used to be a nightclub manager and I suppose Im on the other side of the fence now. ""I gave up because my wife gave me an ultimatum, saying shed go back to Scotland if I didnt. Im so glad I did because she died of cancer two years later and I was able to nurse her with a clear head."" But after working for CAIS for eight years, Huw realised that those in need had nowhere to turn to in the evenings or weekends. Now AGRO offer 24-hour phone support to help an addict avoid having another drink or talk them through a period of anxiety. But AGROs other aim is to help people to recover through getting involved in new activities. They have already turned a piece of Holyhead waste ground into a productive vegetable garden and have future plans to acquire more allotments and open a shop to sell their produce. They will plough any profit back into the community. They also organise walks, kayaking sessions and fishing at weekends to help people get active and have something else to think about. ""It gives people something else to do when they come out of rehab after three or six months,"" explained Huw. ""And people really want to do it. It isnt often you have alcohol and drug addicts working on something together."" He was spurred on to start the groups on Anglesey after figures suggested more people from the island were admitted into Bangors Ysbyty Gwynedd with alcohol-related problems than from anywhere in Gwynedd. But from small beginnings, he see big demand for AGROs work. ""We have all sorts of members,"" said Huw. ""Students, people who own their own businesses, housewives, unemployed people. ""The days of people drinking all day havent completely gone, but mostly now people binge-drink when they get stressed, or have a glass or two, or a bottle every night. ""And the price of alcohol doesnt matter. If you want a drink youll get it, even if there are no buses and you have to walk a long way. ""Its easier to get some alcohol than call a doctor for help at night."" Although Huw is happy to help those who want to recover, he thinks that educating those who are yet to find themselves in trouble is ultimately the way forward. ""We want to go into schools or go to the WI to educate people about the side-effects of alcohol,"" he said. ""If you catch people early enough, then youll avoid spending money on A&E or on unemployment, divorce or sorting out the effect on the kids."" ""Ive seen the suffering it can cause and want to help people early on.""

'Take my brain out': The artists awakened by brain injuries,"Thirty artists are exhibiting their work, many for the first time. The collective has only one thing in common - they all survived severe brain injuries.",,2016-12-07 02:22:29+00:00,BBC News,"Image copyright Phil Thirty extraordinary artists who survived brain injuries, but found a new craft, are exhibiting their work in London this month, many for the first time. For five days a week the art studio at Headway East London, set within a railway arch in Hackney, comes to life with people acquiring new skills and producing artwork. Many had shown little or no interest in art until they were injured and invited into the studio. Each member of Headway East London acquired their injuries as an adult. Some as a result of violent assaults, car crashes or meningitis, while others are from less common causes including hypoxia - a suffocation injury. Ben Graham from the Headway charity says: ""Quite a few of the people were tending to see cant do their former jobs, or their relationships have broken down or maybe theyre the parent but need caring for themselves. Sandra Lott worked in banking in the City of London and would often travel to Europe and America on business. She suffered head trauma in 2013. The resulting injury means she walks with a stick, has cognitive fatigue and aphasia - a communication disorder. Image copyright Headway East London ""When I was at work, I fell over and security got me to the hospital. I was there for three days and then I was okay, but then I fell over on the stairs. Me and my friend we just had a coffee. I was walking around Liverpool Street and there were loads of steps, and thats when I fell on them. ""I was sick for a year. But then, when I came to Headway I just loved it."" Sandra enjoyed art as a child, but gave up as a teenager. One of the pieces she is exhibiting, Witches and Buildings, was inspired by 9/11. She had been working in New York shortly before. Image copyright Sandra Lott ""I had crabs and lizards and there was a man who was going into a helicopter - they were helping them after the World Trade Centre. That was because three weeks before, I went to the city. All the people who died, it was awful."" Sandra says her family has been very supportive of her art. ""My husbands going to come to the exhibition. He loves it. My husband is a photographer. I used to help him. I think in 2017 I would like to help his photography - I really want to do it."" Headway East London started in 1997 with one therapist and a single client. Its since grown and offers a variety of services. Rather than short-term rehabilitation with a discharge date it hopes to offer support as long as is needed; helping to redefine the person and giving them a positive outlook and productive use of their time. Many of the 40 members who use the studio now consider art their job. Graham says ""Therapy is about making yourself better, but what theyre doing is about making something, selling it to people, engaging with the public and forming an identity they feel comfortable and happy with. Image copyright Headway East London ""Essentially theyre no longer unemployed, which affects their self-worth, and gives people that root to self-expression."" Headway is based in a unit complete with a kitchen, gym and therapy rooms with the Submit To Love Studio next door providing a bespoke space for painting, sculpting and ceramics. When it first opened Graham says it led to an ""explosion"" of artwork and an ""astonishing uptake"" which they hope to continue nurturing. Nick Mayers, 56, had spent 16 years in the Parachute Regiment before he had two strokes in one year. The second resulted in a haemorrhage which has affected his speech, memory and mobility. Nick will often paint images he sees in books. Image copyright Nick Mayers ""I was born, Nicholas Mayers. I was born 4th January, Battersea Park. When I was four-years-old I first started to paint."" Nicks strokes meant he has had to teach himself how to draw using his left hand, despite having grown up right-handed."" For anyone thinking of taking up art Nick has some advice: ""Make it up as you go along. When I finish painting I never look back. Dont get attached."" Some of the artists have exhibited before but for many it will be the first time the public has a chance to see and buy the pieces with any profits split 50/50 between the artist and charity. Image copyright Nick Mayers Graham says Headway East London is ""not in a hurry to make it a commercial enterprise"" but already prices have increased. Drawings used to go for about £20, but one artist has sold a piece for £1,600 and has a further eight chosen for £2,400. ""I dont think financial gain is the priority. Feeling valuable and engaged and pursuing something meaningful to them is the most important thing, and in a setting where theyre connecting with others,"" Graham says. ""Theyre doing art for its own sake. Its a really exciting time for us and we all share that sense of pride together as a community."" Phil, a 44 year old father-of-two, was a pedestrian in a road traffic accident in 2015. He has problems with physical and cognitive fatigue, memory and concentration. Image copyright Phil ""I used to draw for my kids. I suppose I did have an eye but it didnt connect to how I would normally do things. ""I was really confused that I couldnt draw a line. Before the accident I would have been fine."" He said he struggled at first spending whole days working on it before declaring ""Ive failed"" but after taking a more relaxed approach art has become his release. ""The piece Im doing now - its massive. Its a painting collage. Its a bit to do with me - the dark to the light. I think its like my journey of this accident."" Image copyright Brian Searle He says before he started at Headway he wasnt sure what to expect. ""People think its like AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] - where you sit around in a circle and give out your feelings. This is totally different. This is my space from 10 til 3, I take my brain out and recharge it. ""Its a wonderful place to recharge my brain and Im allowed to be myself.""

Can a parent save their child from addiction?,The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. The struggles of Mitch and Janis Winehouse to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of couples up and down the country.,,26 July 2011,BBC News,"Image caption In the film Trainspotting, Renton (Ewan McGregor) is put through ""cold turkey"" by his parents The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. Mitch and Janis Winehouses battles to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of parents up and down the country. Many parents reading of the death at the weekend of singer Amy Winehouse will have thought to themselves: ""What would I do if my son or daughter was an addict?"" Some people, like Tom Methven, know only too well what they would do and whether it would work. His son, Jason, 29, is an alcoholic. Mr Methven, from Surrey, said: ""When I heard about Amy Winehouse I thought, Its finally got her. Slave to the addiction ""Drugs and alcohol damage a receptor in the brain. You become a slave. Why else would she have kept taking it? She was a very similar age to my son."" Hannah Meredith was 17 when she died of a heroin overdose in October 2009. Image caption Teenager Hannah Meredith wrote a ""letter to heroin"" a month before her death in 2009 A month before she died, she wrote a ""letter to heroin"". Her aunt, Lisa Moore, read out excerpts from the letter on BBC Radio Five Live last year. Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It takes years to recover but it only takes seconds to relapse."" She said: ""We heard about Amy Winehouses death on Saturday and it brought back feelings of what happened to Hannah. It was two years ago, but its still raw."" Ms Moore said: ""Ive read stuff on Facebook about Amy like one less junkie, and it is so ignorant and insensitive. Families feel helpless, they feel like failures, they think, How can we fix it when that person is choosing to do it?"" ""What people dont realise is that no matter how badly someone is on drugs nothing ever prepares you for the knock on the door or the phone call, nothing prepares you for their death."" She said Hannah had been given an ecstasy tablet on her 14th birthday, ""liked the feeling"" and by the age of 15 was on heroin. Two years later she was ""clean"" but then had her fatal relapse. ""She had been in recovery for four months and was sure she was in control of heroin. She might have thought she would try it one more time,"" said Ms Moore. Both Ms Moore and Mr Methven said there was a lot of ignorance about substance abuse. Tough love They said many people thought they could just lock their son or daughter in a room and make them go ""cold turkey"" - completely denying them drink or drugs - to exorcise their demons. The cold turkey scene has cropped up in films like Trainspotting and soap operas like EastEnders, where a parent uses so-called ""tough love"". But Mr Methven says the reality is that it very rarely works. He has tried almost everything to rescue his son from his alcoholism: Rehab - two sessions in a £500-a-day private clinic. Medication - Antabuse, or disulfiram, a tablet which makes the taker sick if he or she drinks alcohol. Sectioning - a compulsory week in a mental health unit. Psychiatry - several sessions with a top specialist. Image caption Mitch and Janis Winehouse had to deal with their daughters addiction amid the publics gaze At his worst point Jason, who weighs 19 stone (120kg), was drinking huge quantities of vodka and would become violent and aggressive. ""One time he smashed a piece of glass at his girlfriends house and cut an artery. I had to follow the trail of blood to find him. They broke up about a month later. She couldnt cope with it,"" said Mr Methven. He said: ""Another time he was self-harming. He burned himself with an iron and was then banging his head against a table. ""He tried to cut his wrists once with a knife. The police were called and he was taken to hospital. ""He was so drunk he was fighting with the security guards and he got one of them, a big guy, on the floor. Eventually he was given a very strong tranquilliser."" Mr Methven said his son, who is an only child, had a normal childhood and was very intelligent. He went to university and got a first with honours before embarking on a PhD. Out of control But his drinking, which had started as a teenager, got out of control and he never completed it. Jason is now unemployed and gets £20 a week in Disability Living Allowance. ""That is supposed to be given to his mum for laundry and shopping but it is in many respects money for alcohol,"" said his father. Mr Methven said: ""He was about 24 when we realised he had a real problem. We went to the doctor and got a referral. ""We wanted to get him into rehab but it took so long on the NHS that we panicked and went private."" Jason has been into rehab twice. There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it John Methven, Father of an alcoholic On one occasion Mr Methven spent £18,000 and he said: ""Before the cheque was even dry he was back on the drink."" He said: ""There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good-quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it."" Mr Methven said his son had stolen money from him and his wife and had also taken DVDs and other property and sold it at cash converter shops to provide drinking money. Secretive drinking ""Its always secretive drinking. He doesnt go to the pub. He just drinks in his room. He hid it in rucksacks or under the hedge in the garden,"" he said. Jason has now joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has a sponsor, but he is still drinking. ""He is trying to take it down. Yesterday he had six cans (of beer) and today its four. He is still drinking but its far less,"" said Mr Methven. But he said the crucial thing was that Jason has now said he wants to stop. Image caption Nicholas Mills (pictured) hanged himself after a drug-fuelled argument but his twin brother survived and is now clean ""If they are going to get well they have got to go to AA or NA (Narcotics Anonymous). The individual is powerless, but collectively they can do it. Its a spiritual thing. AA is about giving it up altogether. ""Once you are an alcoholic or an addict one is too many and 100 is not enough."" Asked how he feels about his son now, he said: ""Its not so much shame as disappointment about what he could have done with his life."" While Mr Methven can understand the addiction, Elizabeth Burton-Phillips knows the heartbreak of what she calls the ""double whammy"" of addiction and death. Her twin sons, Nicholas and Simon, both became heroin addicts. Nicholas died in 2004 but Simon survived and has kicked the habit. Mrs Burton-Phillips, from Buckinghamshire, has since set up a charity, DrugFam, and she told the BBC: ""We are trying to help families who are struggling to cope with the addiction of their loved ones, like Amy and my son."" She said she met Amys mother in 2008 and added: ""I have been in text contact with her since Amy passed and they are obviously going to be terribly badly affected."" Mrs Burton-Phillips travelled to Llanelli on Monday to give her moral support to the Hannah Meredith Foundation, which launched a support group for the families of those in the Carmarthenshire area coping with substance abuse.

The Department of Health says a final decision will not be made until later this year. Bosence Farm has been providing residential help for people with drug and alcohol dependence since 1995. Mr Mace said: ""Those people who stay around for nine or 10 months are the ones who are best equipped to engage properly with the wider society and stay off drink and drugs on a permanent basis."" The addiction recovery programme includes psychotherapy, yoga, meditation and relaxation. Staff use a 12-step programme recommended by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Amazing benefits Jack, who has been a patient at the farm for nine months, said: ""I came to save my life really. I would be dead otherwise, I took heroin, alcohol, pills, anything really. ""This is the first 12-step programme I have ever tried. The benefits I am getting from it now are amazing. If I left after six months it would have been a complete waste of time. Youre going straight back into the lions den."" Bob Crossland, of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Drug and Alcohol Action Team said, he was more optimistic about funding. ""Payment by results is a worry for a lot of people for lots of reasons, but its also a potential opportunity to get more money in the future."" A spokesman for the Department of Health said a number of pilots would be run throughout 2011.",{},"['stay', 'fears', 'months', 'funding', 'mace', 'bosence', 'farm', 'alcohol', 'dependence', 'drug', 'unit', 'programme', 'health', 'future']","Image caption Bosence Farm has been helping people with drug and alcohol dependence for 16 yearsThe head of a Cornish drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit says he fears changes in government funding could threaten its future.

Belfast court: Woman jailed for drink driving crash,"A woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.",,7 July 2014,BBC News,"Image caption Laganside Court was told that OHara caused the crash whilst on her way to an AA meeting A woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard. Briege OHara, 61, from Antrim Road, Belfast, was jailed for nine months on Monday. She was driving on the wrong side of the road on 27 August 2013, when she hit another motorist and injured him. The court was told that she knew the man whom she injured and was ""entirely remorseful"". A prosecuting lawyer said the crash happened at 11:30 BST on the Antrim Road. OHara had driven around a bend on the wrong side of the road and the van ""didnt have a chance"" to move out of her way. She was arrested and tests showed she had been driving whilst over the limit. OHara said she could not remember the crash. She said she had taken a glass of wine and 5mgs of Diazepam before leaving the house. She pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving and also driving with excess alcohol. The van driver, a man in his mid 60s, broke his sternum and left hand in the collision and lost his job as a delivery driver as a result. He was treated in hospital for his injuries. A defence lawyer said that while the incident was ""utterly disgraceful"", his client was ""entirely remorseful"". He said that she had spent 12 weeks in residential care for alcohol addiction problems almost immediately after causing the crash and had not taken alcohol since then. Her lawyer said she had had a very difficult life and was emotionally fragile. OHara was sentenced to 18 months. She will spend half of this time in prison, with the remaining nine months spent on supervised licence. She was also banned from driving for three years.",{},"['whilst', 'wrong', 'way', 'van', 'crash', 'lawyer', 'woman', 'jailed', 'court', 'belfast', 'road', 'driving', 'drink', 'months']","Image caption Laganside Court was told that O'Hara caused the crash whilst on her way to an AA meetingA woman who caused a head-on collision whilst drunk driving was on her way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Belfast Crown Court has heard.

Production halted on Charlie Sheen sitcom after remarks,"Production of Two and A Half Men is halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.",,25 February 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon Production of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series star, Charlie Sheen. Sheen slammed the programmes producer in a radio interview on Thursday. The decision was based on the ""totality of Charlie Sheens statements, conduct and condition"", Warner Bros Television studio and the CBS network said in a joint statement. The 45-year-old actor has also appeared in the films Wall Street and Platoon. Production of the show had been postponed since late January after Charlie Sheen, the son of Hollywood actor Martin Sheen, entered rehabilitation for reported drug and alcohol abuse. The actors publicist had said earlier on Thursday that Two and a Half Men would resume production next week when Sheen had finished his rehabilitation. But the statement by CBS and Warner Bros Television was issued after Sheen phoned into a US radio programme to criticise the programmes co-creator Chuck Lorre, as well as Alcoholics Anonymous. The actor - one of Americas highest-paid stars - was taken to hospital in Los Angeles with severe abdominal pains late last month before entering rehab. He filed for divorce from his third wife, Brooke Mueller, in November, citing irreconcilable differences. In late October 2009, Sheen was accused of causing damage to a hotel room in New York. After hotel security reported he was disorderly, the actor voluntarily went with authorities for a psychiatric evaluation.",{},"['actor', 'street', 'production', 'halted', 'reported', 'television', 'charlie', 'radio', 'sheen', 'warner', 'wall', 'late', 'remarks', 'sitcom']","Image caption Sheen has also appeared in the films Wall Street and PlatoonProduction of Two and A Half Men has been halted after remarks by the hit US series' star, Charlie Sheen.

Listen to the interview here or read the transcript below. What sent you to the drink and drugs in the first place? Is it because they were readily available? ""Probably at the start. ""I had stuff from my childhood that had tormented me for a load of years, and the drink and the drugs was a symptom of that. I used them because I didnt feel very good about Andy McLaren. ""I used them as a mechanism to blot out these kind of feelings."" Andy McLaren in 1997 And how bad did it get? ""Pretty bad, at certain parts of my life I contemplated taking my own life because of the pain and I didnt like the person I became with the drink and the drugs, or the way I was treating my family."" Was there any one thing that caused you to stop and seek help? ""Well failing a drug test at Reading was a major turning point in my life. The stuff I was doing didnt sit right with me, I wanted to stop but I didnt know how to stop. ""I could stop drink for maybe a week or two but I couldnt stay stopped. ""The Priory introduced me to Alcoholics Anonymous and to helping myself. Youve got to want to stop. ""Alcoholism had just taken over, it was the most important thing in my life.

""Id make them aware of the pitfalls, thats something Id really like to go and do is speak to the youngsters at clubs and warn them of the dangers. ""Im not saying for a minute that theres a problem with drugs in football but there is a drug problem in society so I think its naive to think that people arent getting offered them in football."" Theres so much money in football, do you think clubs do enough to protect the younger players? ""I think theres a lot more now then what there used to be. Its become silly the money in football. And young football players have lots of money and lots of time on their hands, which isnt a very good cocktail."" What are you doing to earn a living now? ""Im still playing - with Ayr United in the 2nd Division in Scotland. ""Ive enjoyed the last seven years.

Recovering Durham alcoholic starts blog to help others,A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his experiences in beating his addiction in an online blog designed to help others.,,5 May 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Martin Prest drank 83 units in two days A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his thoughts and experiences in an online blog to help others beat the addiction. Martin Prest has been sober for 18 months following his daily battle with drink for the past eight years. He regularly used to drink about 18 pints a day. He has now set up the informative blog, Open Alcoholic, to catalogue his experience battling alcohol addiction. ""I thought that alcoholism is so difficult sometimes to understand from the outside if you havent lived it, and after speaking to people over my 18 months sobriety... family members or people who care about them, they cant necessarily understand,"" Mr Prest said. ""Theyve asked me what its like and to try an explain this process, this mindset, that theyve watched destroy someone and I really wanted to use the website to try and explain it better."" My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking Martin Prest The 26-year-old uses his blog to explain how he came to terms with his addiction and overcame it, but how it still troubles him. Mr Prest unknowingly had his first taste of alcohol when he was just seven-years-old. ""It was funny because I didnt know it was alcoholic and I knew I wasnt allowed to drink it,"" he said. ""I started stealing sips of it in the morning when I was seven, it was on a top shelf on a cupboard and I could nip up and get it and have a sip, just because I liked the taste of it, I didnt know what it was or anything."" Following this early taste his drinking habits became out of control from the age of 18 and he went from being a social drinker to drinking alone and getting drunk. ""I drank until I was drunk and could finally fall asleep, everyday for years. The only time I actually noted down how much I drank was my last weekend drinking,"" he said. ""I knew I was going to stop drinking, I was sort of saying farewell to it and I drank through 83 units in two days, I was drinking mostly bitters and real ale and thats 18 pints and I wasnt drunk - I could still walk straight and I was still holding conversations and stuff, I mean how much I drank when I did get drunk I have no idea, more than that."" Spontaneously haemorrhaging After years of destroying his body through drink, his health problems became visible. ""My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking,"" he said. ""I was spontaneously haemorrhaging, I was bleeding out of my face from the damage that was being done, my head was just exploding in pain constantly my body was just wrecked. I knew I had to stop drinking."" Mike Scott, a GP in Newcastle, said: ""Liver disease can lose the bloods ability to clot, so therefore you tend to bleed more easily. ""A cut or damage to the skin is arguably going to bleed more with an unhealthy liver."" Mr Prest, added: ""Its such an insane process because you lose everything and it ruins your life essentially, I mean Ive obviously picked back up again but you still want to drink you still want to get drunk, it never ever goes away, its just engrained in your personality.""

Former alcoholic 'scared' by rise in young drinkers,"A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems.",,30 December 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is scared by the rise in the number of young drinkers A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group. Patrick Martin, 64, once drank a litre of vodka a day at the height of his alcohol addiction. Mr Martin, who has been sober for three years, has lost two partners to alcohol-related illnesses. Now he is worried by the rise in the number of young people at his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. ""We are getting more young people at meetings, particularly young women,"" he said. ""They are getting really ill through drinking and it scares me for future generations. ""My heart goes out to them. I wish I could tell them what Ive been through."" Wallowed in sadness Mr Martin, who lives in Norwich, said he has seen a sharp rise in young people aged between 22 to 28 coming to the group. I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness Patrick Martin Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of alcohol-related deaths for 15 to 34-year-olds in the UK has almost doubled in nearly 20 years. In 1991, 137 young people aged between 15 and 34 died of alcohol-related problems. Of those, 48 were women. By 2009, the total number of alcohol-related deaths had risen to 261, of which 94 were women. ""The stories we hear from these young people are harrowing to say the least,"" Mr Martin said. ""They let their hair down at weekends but these weekends tend to get out of hand for a lot of them."" Mr Martin said his drink problem started to escalate in his late 20s, when he drank as a way to escape the pressure he felt in his work as a pottery designer. At the height of his addiction, Mr Martin said would sometimes go without eating for two weeks when on a drinking binge. ""I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness,"" he said. ""When you are drinking, your only thoughts from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out is where you can get your next drink from. Nothing else matters."" Rock bottom Mr Martin said his alcohol problem has shortened his life and robbed him of his marriage and his relationship with his son. Two former partners have also died of alcohol-related illnesses in the past six years, he added. Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for almost 30 years, Mr Martin said he decided to stop drinking quite suddenly three-and-a-half years ago. ""I just put the drink down one day,"" he said. ""I had reached my rock bottom and climbed back up but a lot of people dont."" Mr Martin, who has now retired for health reasons, is calling for better education to help stem the rising tide of young drinkers. ""You are not going to stop people drinking by putting alcohol prices up,"" he said. ""If you are desperate for alcohol, you will steal to get it. ""I dont think the health services or Government take the problem seriously enough or realise how serious it will be in a few years. ""If they carry on drinking, a lot of these young people will be in the same boat as me in 10 years time.""",{},"['young', 'scared', 'alcoholrelated', 'alcoholic', 'alcohol', 'rise', 'drinkers', 'mr', 'number', 'martin', 'drinking', 'problem', 'drink']","Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkersA recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Sadie Frost says Mirror hacking caused 'living hell',"Actress Sadie Frost tells a hearing phone hacking by Mirror Group journalists made her life ""a living hell"" for many years.",,12 March 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Frost said hacking by Mirror journalists affected her relationship with fellow actor Jude Law Actress Sadie Frost has told the High Court that having her phone hacked by Mirror Group journalists made her life a ""living hell"". Describing the experience as the ""lowest of the low"", the 49-year-old actress and businesswoman said she did not know who to trust. In 2003, she had a breakdown and went into hospital, which was a ""terrible"" incident but ended up in the papers. Ms Frost is among eight high-profile figures claiming damages for hacking. She told the court: ""Your father is dying, you are going through divorce, you have postnatal depression, you are in and out of hospital, my baby was ill, he was born premature. ""I was at breaking point, I could not sleep, or eat, and I did not know who to trust as information kept getting into the media. ""I needed my loved ones around me. I was very upset, I was a very, very unhappy person. ""Every time I turned to someone to confide in them, it ended up in the newspapers, which added to my distress and trauma."" ""I couldnt go and sit with my mum and have a cup of tea because I thought she was selling stories. I didnt trust my own mother."" Panic attacks Ms Frost said her separation from fellow actor Jude Law was very difficult. ""I thought it might be Jude, trying to make me look bad for custody reasons, or my friends or family using me for their own gains. Either thought was heartbreaking. ""This was a deeply stressful time in my life and the fact my insecurities were being publicised obviously made it worse."" She described how friends, particularly model Kate Moss, questioned whether they could trust her. ""Even worse than that, Jude, the father of my children, thought for years that I was selling stories which created an animosity between us that has only really disappeared since the revelations about phone hacking."" Image caption Sadie Frost said she was humiliated when a story emerged about her attending an AA meeting Ms Frost said: ""I couldnt take my youngest son to the park for two years because he was photographed. He would cry and I would get panic attacks. ""I lost two to three years of my life, they wanted me to fail. She told the hearing that it felt like she and those closest to her were ""being monitored and hunted down by a sort of secret police"". ""Every area of my life was affected. There was nowhere I could go that was safe."" ""If I went to the doctor or gynaecologist, details would be in the newspaper."" Embarrassed and humiliated Ms Frost said she was left ""incredibly embarrassed and humiliated"" when a story emerged about her attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. She said she had been advised to go a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous ""because it was a safe place"". ""Someone quite high-profile took me there and I went there after everyone said it would be safe and anonymous,"" she told the court. ""I was portrayed as troubled, sad, as a party-girl. Thats not why people go to AA, they go there to get help and be in a safe place.""

Traci My Brother has been an alcoholic for over 15 years now, coupled with scar tissue from a head injury which is inoperable and cannot be treated but would be manageable without the presence of alcohol. In our opinion he is not safe nor capable of living on his own and carrying out normal daily tasks. He suffers from siezures and we often find him in hospital. He has been admitted to a psychiatic ward for his alcohol abuse, dried out and sent home. He wasnt offered any rehabilitation afterwards because there was no room for him. It has long been our opinion that Mark has been cheated of the chance to beat his addiction because no after care is ever given. Try telling an alcoholic to go home after 10 days in a clinic and dont do it again. How is it that other people get onto programmes such as James Kingham but Mark has been overlooked for years now. We are all trudging a very long emotional road which has, in particular, made my Mother very sick. Mark has on several occassions been ready to quit but hasnt been given the support he so desperately deserves and needs.

Manchester riots: Doughnut thief jailed for 16 months,A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre is jailed for 16 months.,,18 August 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Thomas Downey had spent his only £4 on tobacco A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre has been jailed for 16 months. Thomas Downey, 48, was released from HMP Manchester on 9 August shortly before getting caught up in the riots. The serial offender went to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous before downing a bottle of sherry and stumbling into Krispy Kreme in Piccadilly Gardens. He was caught with a box of doughnuts when 20 riot officers arrived. Downey admitted burglary and breach of an Asbo by entering part of the city centre from which he is prohibited. Judge Robert Atherton, sentencing at Manchester Crown Court, told him: ""You drink too much, too regularly and when in drink become threatening and abusive."" Expressed remorse The total cost of damage to the shop - which was unsecured before Downey went in for the doughnuts - was about £17,000, prosecutors said. The court heard he had more than 100 convictions for 233 offences and had been released from prison at 19:30 BST that day. Zoe Nield, for Downey, said her client had left jail with only £4 in his pocket. He was not involved in rioting but took the doughnuts because he was hungry, having spent his money on tobacco, she said. She added: ""He cant recall the events because he was drunk but he has expressed remorse."" Among the others to be sentenced was David Swarbrick, 25, was jailed for two years after he stole £25 worth of Oil of Olay from a Quality Save store in Parker Street, which was unsecured after an earlier attack. Thrown away Swarbrick, of Aston Old Road, Openshaw, admitted burglary and breach of a suspended sentence order. Father-of-four Anthony Winder, 38, looted the Swarovski Crystal store and smashed a display cabinet to get an ornamental dog, the court heard. He was also jailed for two years. The judge told him he had ""made a highly respectable life"" for himself and his family, despite a difficult childhood. ""You should have been at the forefront of leading people away from such activities but you became involved,"" the judge said. ""Now you have thrown so much away.""",{},"['riots', '16', 'downey', 'thief', 'doughnuts', 'told', 'store', 'manchester', 'jailed', 'doughnut', 'court', 'went', 'unsecured', 'spent', 'months']","Image caption Thomas Downey had spent his only £4 on tobaccoA man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre has been jailed for 16 months.

Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is taking the devolved government in Belfast to the high court over its refusal to reform the abortion law. The Commission wants a change in the law so that women and girls in Northern Ireland have the choice of accessing a termination of pregnancy in circumstances of serious foetal abnormality, rape or incest. What is the basis for their legal challenge? Are you among the thousands of women who resolved to cut down or stop drinking for January? Or perhaps youre among those whore hoping to give up the booze for good? A new wave of clubs and websites is springing up to support the growing numbers of women who are worried about their alcohol intake, but how do they differ from Alcoholics Anonymous and can they really help? This weekend a new exhibition exploring the legacy of one of the most important and controversial artists of modern times opens at the Norwich Castle art gallery. The French artist, Edouard Manets provocative paintings of women scandalised the Paris art world, but they challenged traditional depictions of women, and paved the way for professional female artists of the early 20th century. We discuss the impact of his work. Australian Author, Colleen McCullough, has died at the age of 77. Her most famous novel, The Thorn Birds, a story of an unlikely affair between a young woman and a priest, sold more than 30 million copies and became a successful mini-series. But how did she come to give up a promising career in neurophysiology to become one of Australia most famous and loved authors?

'How I lost my dad to alcohol addiction',When Charlotte's dad was taken to hospital he couldn't open his mouth any more.,,None,,"When Charlottes dad was taken to hospital he couldnt open his mouth any more. His face was paralysed and his heart and liver had become enlarged after years of drinking far too much alcohol. Then one by one, his internal organs shut down. He died just before Christmas last year, aged 59. But Charlotte, 27, tells Newsbeat she feels like she lost him to alcohol addiction years ago. ""In your teenage years you become more aware of your parents behaviour,"" she says. ""Id realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isnt normal. Finding dad passed out in front of the television at two oclock in the morning isnt normal."" Id realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isnt normal Hiding it Charlotte was about 15 when she realised her dad, Iain Hayman, was having problems with alcohol. ""The older I got the more I realised his relationship with alcohol was incredibly unhealthy because he was hiding it. Hed lie to mum and say, I havent had a drink today and youd think, I saw you earlier. Yes you did. ""We never knew how much he was drinking. It started off with a bottle of wine a night and then it would go up to three or four. ""Every time you find a bottle of wine you struggle with Do I dob him in and cause an argument or do I lie to my mum? ""The more you tidied, the more you found out about dad."" Its quite an embarrassing illness Charlotte explains how her father was effectively ""living two lives"". ""Id come home from school and hed be asleep in bed. Hed be really down,"" she says. ""It was a slow deterioration. Every time he felt positive you really wanted to get behind him and support him, which is what he needed.. Ill have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories ""But the more it happened and the more he failed, it became difficult to put that aside. ""He was living two lives because until I was 18 it didnt really come out that he was an alcoholic ""He hid very well that he wasnt paying the mortgage [on our house]. ""It came out that we were really close to losing the house. We had bailiffs knocking on the door. ""I was working in the village pub and youd often be told stories like Charlotte, I saw your dad passed out on the path and I almost tripped over him. ""Its quite an embarrassing illness for your parent to have because they lose their inhibitions and dont care what people think of them."" Daddys girl ""I was a proper daddys girl. We were very close. Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just dont need it. ""I have so many nice memories of him. Ill have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories and I think of him drunk, and I think of him not able to stop for us. ""Its a mixed bag of emotions because you have the anger that he did this to himself."" Role reversal ""It was a role reversal because you end up looking out for him and making sure he gets ready for the day. And then always worrying about what he was doing. ""Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just dont need it. ""You should be able to rely on your parents to help you and support you, and it just wasnt there [from him]. Emotionally its very difficult."" I distanced myself from him After years of struggling with the effects of Iains addiction, Charlottes mum decided she couldnt take any more. She asked him to move out of their home last year. Sadly, thats when his drinking increased. Hed lost his job and even began stealing alcohol. ""In the last year I distanced myself from him because I found it too difficult. You really wanted to get behind him and support him, but the more he failed [to stop drinking] it became difficult to put that aside. ""He was in a bad way again, he was out of breath. And then he ended up fainting, got an ambulance to the hospital, and then he never came out. ""He couldnt even talk for the last three weeks of his life. ""You have this anger that hes done this to himself. But we all just had to put it to one side and we just had to be forgiving. ""Now we can grieve the man we lost when I was a teenager.""

Food addiction: could overeating be compulsive?,Alcoholism researcher Sally Marlow examines whether food addiction could be fuelling a rise in obesity,,30 April 2013,BBC News,"Image copyright Science Photo Library Scientists are divided over whether or not addiction could be contributing to rising global obesity. Does food addiction really exist and - if it does - how can it be treated? Getting a grip on addiction can be incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to give up smoking, alcohol or even caffeine will testify. A tried and tested tactic is to avoid the thing youre addicted to - giving up going to pubs for a while, or not to have cigarettes in the house. Even with these measures people often struggle and fail repeatedly. But what if the thing you are addicted to has to be kept in the house, and worse, has to be something you sit down in front of three times a day? As obesity levels continue to rise, the scientific community is starting to look for similarities between overeating and addiction. The EU has funded a project called NeuroFAST to bring all the evidence together. About the author Sally Marlow is an alcohol addiction researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London. She has reported on alcohol for Radio 4s Today programme and for Inside Health Researchers are cautious. So far there is only one type of eating disorder where it is thought addiction plays a role: Binge Eating Disorder, a side effect of which is often obesity. Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip. It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction. One of the people I spoke to as part of my research, Michael, is an articulate, educated professional and a former overeater. He said: ""Its difficult for others to understand. Everyone overeats and they think its just a bigger version of that. ""Its a completely different experience - a constant, daily minute-to-minute obsession about getting the substance, food. ""It is hell being there in that place."" Louise, another of those I met, provides a compelling testimony for addiction being at work in overeating. She also had a serious alcohol problem and understands addiction more than most. ""I think whats most interesting is the similarities in behaviour,"" she says. What is Binge Eating Disorder? A feeling of compulsion to overeat on a regular basis, sometimes including pre-planned binges Those affected consume large amounts of food in a short time, often when they are not hungry Overeating usually happens in private, leaving the person feeling out of control or guilty The disorder is linked to obesity and conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease Treatments include anti-depressants and cognitive therapies Source: NHS ""As an alcoholic I would go to different off-licences to buy my alcohol so people wouldnt recognise me, but Id also go to different newsagents to buy chocolate so they wouldnt recognise me. ""Sneaking it into the house, not wanting people to see, hiding food, like an alcoholic hiding bottles, hiding empties."" Dr Nora Volkow, a prominent neuroscientist and head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, is clear in her mind that there are biological processes underpinning what Michael and Louise describe. She has found that a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is known to be involved in addiction, behaves in the brain in the same way in those who are heavily addicted to drugs and those who are obese. For her this is strong evidence that food, or eating, can be addictive. Not everybody agrees. Professor Jane Ogden, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, believes the label of addiction can be unhelpful for those who overeat - it removes personal responsibility and hinders recovery. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of obese people in the UK has more than trebled in 25 years ""The addiction world has given us a strong narrative that says you have no control - things in your brain are wanting more sugar or chocolate"" she says. But if food is like other addictions, we should theoretically see overlaps in successful treatments. Addiction treatment has a goal of either complete abstinence or reducing harm - for example by prescribing methadone or nicotine gum. For those working towards abstinence, one tried and tested model is the 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, with versions for drugs used by Narcotics Anonymous and gambling by Gamblers Anonymous. Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea Michael and Louise are both members of Overeaters Anonymous. It works in much the same way as the other 12-step programmes with peer-led group confidential meetings, personal mentors, and a structured programme of steps to work through. There is no doubt that for some its highly successful, just like Alcoholics Anonymous can be. Its not possible to abstain from eating, of course, but it is possible to abstain from overeating. For Louise, abstinence is three healthy meals a day, no wheat and no chocolate. For Michael his abstinence food plan is determined by his sponsor - he is told by someone else what he is allowed to eat. Other treatments are more radical. In alcohol addiction, the body can be altered so that it rejects alcohol by implanting a drug known as antabuse. If alcohol is consumed, the body reacts with nausea. Similarly in overeating, the body can be altered by bariatric surgery - a gastric band, bypass or sleeve, which restricts the volume of the stomach available for food. It sounds extreme but it works for most people, and the evidence shows the risks of surgery are far outweighed by the health benefits of losing excess weight. People live longer, and have fewer heart and mobility problems. Diabetes is even reversed in some cases, and people report a massively improved quality of life. The possible relationships between food and addiction are incredibly complicated, and there is a lot we do not yet understand. Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea, and good evidence to support it. Are we at the same place with food - waiting for the evidence and attitudes to change? Nicola Schlesinger, a counsellor, works with women who have addiction problems and eating disorders. What would she say to those scientists who do not believe food can be addictive? ""They dont necessarily have the people sitting in front of them that I have on a daily basis in tears, in pain, hating themselves, feeling suicidal,"" she says. ""They can say what they like but in the end we still have to deal with the reality of the situation as it presents itself."" Hopefully NeuroFAST and others will move us closer to narrowing the gap between scientists on both sides of the debate, and find solutions for people who do feel a compulsion to overeat.

Thousands of dangerous drink-drivers are reoffenders,"Almost one in five motorists listed on an official register of the most dangerous drink-drivers has been on it before, the BBC learns through a Freedom of Information request.",,27 September 2013,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anish Patel, whose wife was killed by a drink driver: ""Something has to be done"" As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders. A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before. There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences. The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent. Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"". Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLAs scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before. Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired. But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent. However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence. Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754. Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined. Bitter experience Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"". He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem. ""I suspect from the people that Ive dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it wont effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent."" In 2009, Anish Patels wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London. Image caption The driver of this lorry who killed Catriona Patel had been on a drinking binge the night before. He was jailed for seven years. The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving. Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together."" He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the drivers previous convictions. ""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldnt have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London. ""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. "" Get carried away Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks. He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again. He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably Id end up drink-driving. ""Im not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? Youre going to lose your liberty, youre going to lose your job, youre going to lose your home. Youre going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving."" Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests. ""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently. ""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it."" Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road. ""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive.""

Fact + Comment = NEWS,,,None,,"Sometimes reading a days collection of pop news is like watching one great big lumbering elephant lollop about while lots of tiny little mice run about underneath, dragging their (cough) TALES behind them. Sometimes it is like a team of gossip dolphins all fighting over one whisperfish. Today, the individual news stories have all fused together to become one long snake, and, as our second little anecdote reveals, it seems to be a pretty venomous one... THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE Britney Spears has been overheard begging someone to come with her to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. The man she was overheard speaking to is called Justin, and this therefore MEANS that she is DEFINITELY talking to Justin Timberlake. It has been reported in the US magazine Star that she said this: ""Come on Justin, please, please, please come!"" CHARTBLOG SAYS: Captain Sexyback isnt the only Justin in the world. Maybe Britney is a secret Eurovision fan, and was showing support for her favourite would-be entry... ==================================== THE NECK OF THE SNAKE Speak of the devil....Justin Hawkins has offered the entire British public out for a fight, possibly to cover up his embarrassment at not being chosen as this years Eurovision entry. Possibly not. He put a posting up on his MySpace page saying: ""Why didnt Big Brovas make it to the sing off? They were amazing! Perhaps the UK is racist. Or stupid. Or both."" Only it seems he has NOT offered everyone out after all, as hes now saying it was all a big fuss over nothing: ""I congratulated Scooch on the night, just like every other contestant. There was no storming into dressing rooms or any of the other bulls*** Ive read today."" CHARTBLOG SAYS: World, calm down! Hes Justin Hawkins, he SAYS STUFF. This is what he do. ==================================== THE SHOULDERS OF THE SNAKE While were on TV talent contests, Louis Walsh has apparently been signed up to be one of the judges on the new all-male version of the BBCs How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria, which is to be called Any Dream Will Do. If its true, this is odd, because Louis claimed to be keen to get back to his day job of band management, once the X-Factor went sour on him too (just like it did for Michelle, Steve, Shayne...blahblahblah). CHARTBLOG SAYS: Is it possible the only person involved in Louis former TV show who really has The X-Factor is Simon Cowell? Everyone else seems to be disappearing like beer in a sieve. ==================================== THE BODY OF THE SNAKE And in his capacity as manager of Girls Aloud, Louis has been hinting at the final days of Girls Aloud. Or hinting at the final days of Girls Alouds record contract, at the very least. He told Now magazine: ""Theyre doing one more album for Polydor. I think rumours about the band splitting started because Nadine is in Los Angeles, but shes only in Los Angeles because shes going out with a guy there, Jesse Metcalfe."" CHARTBLOG SAYS: Hold on to those pop obituaries just yet. ==================================== THE END OF THE TAIL... Although, having said that, Sarah Aloud might be looking to pastures new, especially as shes been given a firm job offer from a rival act. Well, I say firm...I think the correct word is probably infirm or even jokey. Alex Turner from the Arctic Monkeys told the NME: ""Im finding less and less to say. Im wilting as a frontman, right, so Im thinking, third album, well just get Sarah Harding to front the band. Ill sing some of the old songs to keep the hardcore happy and then all the new tunes can just be her."" CHARTBLOG SAYS: OMG! REALLY?? REALLY REALLY??

Leala Padmanabhan investigates, telling the story of her late father, who became alcoholic in his 70s. Heavy drinking by older people is causing a major public health risk in the UK, yet the issue often falls below the radar. While alcohol consumption among the young is falling, the over 60s are drinking more, and more harmfully, with one in three developing problems with alcohol for the first time in later life and alcohol-related hospital admissions among the old rising alarmingly.

Despite his background as a doctor and his long experience of witnessing his wifes alcoholism, Lealas father was unable to rehabilitate himself, and his drink problem helped contribute to his death in 2010. Lealas family is the starting point for a programme telling her own and similar stories. A large number of people are developing problems in later life, partly because of social factors associated with their age, such as loneliness, bereavement, depression and boredom. In addition to these late-onset drinkers there is a large number of ""baby boomers"" who are carrying heavy drinking patterns into old age.

Boy George named patron of Focus 12,,,2011-08-10 10:18:02,,"Boy George has become a patron of Focus 12, the drug and alcohol rehabilitation charity based in Suffolk.

Russell Brand and Davina McCall are also patrons of Focus 12.

He said the support and publicity provided by the patrons had kept Focus 12 running. Boy George, whose real name is George ODowd, made his name with Culture Club and has himself battled with drug addiction. ""It did used to be something that was associated with music and celebrities, but nowadays its so widespread,"" he said.

Lou Vincent: The most brutal form of apology,Cricketer Lou Vincent this week admitted he was a cheat. His apology came in stark style.,,5 July 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lou Vincent The cricketer Lou Vincent has admitted attempting to fix matches. His apology came in stark style. He exhales loudly. Then he begins his statement: ""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat."" The former New Zealand cricketer, in 10 words, admits what he has done, how he has contravened and undermined his own sport by accepting money for match-fixing. Viewers are left in no doubt. Vincent, at the age of 35, has been banned for life from playing, coaching or participating in any other way in organised cricket after breaching 18 anti-corruption rules in matches played in 2008 and 2011. Even so, the nature of the opening of his video confession - in which he goes on to say he has ""shamed"" his sport, country and family - seems unusually stark. The formula of the opening words is the same as that used by some members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Those attending at meetings are not compelled to say: ""My name is XXXX and I am an alcoholic."" But many choose to do so, citing its cathartic effect and the creation of a sense of community. Vincent, who has suffered from depression, is unlikely to feel the same immediate mutual support from his fellow cricketers. But might he eventually gain respect for his statement, in which he also says he wants to face up to what he has done ""like a man and accept the consequences""? ""Its very healthy,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. ""You dont get enough of people admitting when theyve done something wrong, particularly in the workplace."" Image copyright Reuters Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez has faced criticism over his initial refusal to apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup match. He has since given a qualified apology - one that expressed sympathy for his victim but did not fully address Suarezs culpability and ongoing problem. ""What the cricketer has done is completely unlike the Suarez situation,"" says Cooper. ""If Suarez had come out straight away and said hed done wrong under the stress of the situation he would have received much more sympathy. Whats happened here in cricket will raise Vincent in peoples estimation. The timing is absolutely key."" Vincent recorded his statement after admitting to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he had committed match-fixing offences in Twenty20 games when he played for Lancashire and Sussex. It pre-empted the ECBs own announcement. Sussex County Cricket Club has welcomed the punishment of Vincent, who has played in 23 Tests and 102 one-day internationals. ""The episode has been a very difficult time for our players, staff and indeed all supporters of Sussex Cricket,"" says chief executive Zac Toumazi. ""We are determined to do all we can to drive this issue away from our game and remain vigilant and committed in doing so."" Cricket is keen to clean up its image after revelations going back more than a decade, when it was revealed the South African captain Hansie Cronje had fixed matches. In his confession in 2000, Cronje opened by saying he had been a Christian all his life and had tried to ""walk the way the Lord wanted me to walk"". Hansie Cronje Image copyright Getty Images Image caption South Africa cricket captain Hanse Cronje confessed to match fixing in 2000 Right-handed middle-order batsman appointed South Africa captain in 1994, aged 24 Charged by Indian police in April 2000 with fixing one-day international matches, but initially denied wrongdoing Sacked as captain four days later when he changed his story and admitted taking money to provide information to gambling interests Banned from cricket for life in June 2000 Died in plane crash in South Africas Western Cape in 2002 The golfer Tiger Woods, in his scripted 2010 apology in front of the worlds media for his marital infidelities, also adopted a more gradual introduction to the description of his wrongdoings than Vincent. ""Good morning. And thank you for joining me,"" he said. ""Many of you in the room are my friends. Many of you in this room know me. Many of you have cheered for me, or worked with me, or supported me, and now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me. ""I want to say to each of you, simply, and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour I engaged in."" Could Vincents more direct statement lead to some form of public redemption, even if it does not, and cannot, involve any future involvement with cricket? ""What he has done is probably the best way,"" says speechwriter and presentation coach Max Atkinson. ""It reminds me of (Liberal Democrat leader) Paddy Ashdown in 1992 admitting he had had an affair. That worked. He came across as honest. Its best just to come out and say it."" The difference is that Ashdown could argue his personal life did not interfere with his professional one. Like Cronje, Vincent cannot. But Peter Davies, a consultant at Manchester PR firm RMS, thinks there is a chance of a return to some standing. ""Lou Vincents statement comes across like its personal,"" he says. ""Thats good. Although he must have had advice, probably including from his lawyers, it doesnt sound like that. Its not over-scripted and he does it in his own voice. ""But Vincent has lots of work to do if he wants to change his image. Hell have to do something to show hes trying to make a difference and hes truly changed his ways.""

Smashed: Mary Elizabeth Winstead on playing an alcoholic,An independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News speaks to its director and stars.,,14 December 2012,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead tells the BBC why she took on her most dramatic role to date A low-budget independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News spoke to its director and stars. Movie awards voters tend to be impressed by hard-hitting studies of alcoholism, regularly rewarding films that have highlighted the perils of the demon drink. Ray Milland won an Oscar in 1946 for playing a drunkard in The Lost Weekend, as did Nicolas Cage, 50 years later, for imbibing himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas. Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywoods highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple. It can work for actresses too. Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses. All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this years awards race. Only last month, she was nominated for a Spirit award, alongside Jennifer Lawrence (from Silver Linings Playbook) and child performer Quvenzhane Wallis (from Beasts of the Southern Wild). Could an Oscar nomination follow in January? During a visit to London last month, the 28-year-old was studiously playing down her chances. Wonderful imagination ""Im very aware my chances are not very high so Im not getting my hopes up,"" says the actress, previously seen in quirky movies like Scott Pilgrim vs The World and Quentin Tarantinos Death Proof. ""But its lovely to hear anyone say anything like that about a performance Ive done, and I certainly cant help but fantasise about the idea of being a part of it in some way."" ""I had seen Mary in big action films like Die Hard 4.0 and the remake of The Thing,"" says Smashed director James Ponsoldt, whose work won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival last January. Image caption Paul (left) is known to US TV audiences for playing Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad ""But spending time with her, I realised what a wonderful imagination she has and how willing she was to really prepare for this role."" Those sentiments are shared by actor Aaron Paul, who took a break from playing a crystal meth dealer in TVs Breaking Bad to appear as Charlie, Kates free-spirited, perennially intoxicated husband. ""The goal in this business is to get lost in the scenes and truly feel like youre living moments as if they were your own,"" says the 33-year-old. ""That happened pretty much every day on set with Mary. It was great and a wonderful experience."" Should accolades come in Smasheds direction, it would be quite a coup for a film shot in just 19 days for a reported $500,000 (£312,557). Not only that, but it would also surely be the first movie so honoured to feature a teacher publicly relieving herself on a convenience store floor. For Winstead, used to projecting glamorous self-assurance on red carpets and in photo shoots, fabricating something so indecorous and unladylike must have posed a challenge. Apparently, though, such considerations were secondary compared to the need to make an artificial bladder function on cue. Not propaganda ""Whats funny in scenes like that is that sometimes the technical aspects end up overriding everything else,"" the actress smiles. ""I was wearing this... device, and when I sat down I had to put my arm on my leg to activate it. ""And it wasnt working - every take it wasnt working. On every take everyone was behind the camera going, Is it going to work? ""So it really got rid of all of the humiliation of doing that scene, because all the focus was on hoping that it worked and that we could actually get the scene done."" Winsteads character is driven to seek help from Alcoholics Anonymous, much to the chagrin of her hard-drinking husband. Image caption The cast of Smashed includes Octavia Spencer (right), who won an Oscar this year for The Help The film takes a fairly uncritical view of the organisation, which is depicted by Ponsoldt and his co-writer Susan Burke as a benignly tolerant force for social good. ""Susan and I have very complicated feelings towards AA,"" says the director. ""We both know people whose lives have been saved by it, and we know people who left because they thought it was a cult. ""We didnt want to glorify it; this is certainly not a propaganda film. Nor did we want to take easy shots at it. ""We just wanted the scenes at AA to feel honest and true, so we went to great lengths to make sure they were accurate."" As graphic as Smashed becomes, particularly when Paul and Winsteads characters are at their most inebriated, it is not inconceivable the film could benefit the organisation. Winstead is happy for it to have a dual purpose, saying it would be ""fantastic"" if the film was ""used in any sort of positive way"". ""People have come up to me after screenings who work with alcoholics and feel it would be a great tool for them to use,"" she says. ""I think the reason they feel that way is it feels more real than other films on the subject, and a lot more relatable to people of this generation."" Recovery point Smashed is not the only film around at present to have an alcoholic protagonist. Another is Flight, out in the UK in February, in which Denzel Washington plays an airline pilot waging his own battle with the bottle. Winstead admits it is ""interesting"" for the two to emerge at the same time but insists that they are ""very different films"". ""Smashed is about a person getting their life together, while Flight is about somebody in the throes of alcoholism who cant get to that recovery point,"" she muses. Image caption Denzel Washington plays a pilot in Flight found to be harbouring a dark secret ""Although they are both anchored and rooted in alcoholism, they tell very different stories."" ""I think its funny in a quirky, cosmic way that they both came out so close to each other,"" laughs Ponsoldt. ""I just wish we had Flights marketing budget. ""But I see it as a win for everybody. The world is better when both the independents and studios are making movies for adults that deal with serious issues that pertain to everyones lives."" So how does one set about playing an addict? For Aaron Paul, the most effective route to finding his character was also the simplest. ""What I did for research was drink - a lot more than I had ever in my entire life,"" he reveals. ""I filmed myself getting severely intoxicated and I studied the tapes. ""I also went onto YouTube and typed in drunk people acting crazy,"" he continues. ""Its incredible what you can find out there."" Smashed is out in the UK and Ireland on 14 December.",{},"['elizabeth', 'caption', 'won', 'work', 'smashed', 'winstead', 'alcoholic', 'paul', 'playing', 'oscar', 'mary', 'film', 'feel']","Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywood's highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple.

"Soul Music, Series 16, Make Me a Channel of Your Peace","Exploring the hymn that inspires campaigners, charity workers and reformed alcoholics.",,None,BBC,"An exploration of the global impact of the 1960s hymn Make Me a Channel of Your Peace. Just what inspired it? From July 2013. Episode 3 of 5. The hymn Make Me a Channel of Your Peace found its way into weddings, funerals and school assemblies and in this weeks Soul Music we hear how it has also embedded itself into the hearts of peace campaigners, charity workers and reformed alcoholics. The simplicity of this hymn often belies the challenges at its heart. Its lyrics call for unconditional love and forgiveness in the toughest situations. The words are based on a poem which has often been attributed to St Francis of Assisi. However, Franciscan Historian, Dr Christian Renoux, suggests it was most likely to have been written by an anonymous French noble women. The poem travelled across the globe with translations published during the first and second world wars, subsequently bringing inspiration to public figures ranging from Mother Theresa to President Roosevelt. In 1967 it caught the eye of South African born musician and yogi Sebastian Temple who put these words to its most famous musical arrangement. Its Sebastians version that was played at Princess Dianas funeral and that has also touched the hearts of millions worldwide. Mathew Neville of childrens charity World Vision recalls his encounter with this hymn in the Democratic Republic of Congo, whilst closer to home Wendy and Colin Parry share their memories of this music and the role it played in remembering their son Tim, who was killed in the 1993 Warrington Bombings. In Minnesota former lawyer Mike Donohue reflects on how this hymn has guided him on a journey through alcohol abuse and dementia and Sarah Hershberg remembers her good friend Sebastian Temple, who first played this simple hymn in her front room before it went on to travel the world.",{},"['16', 'temple', 'played', 'channel', 'sebastian', 'music', 'words', 'series', 'hymn', 'hearts', 'world', 'peace', 'poem', 'soul']","An exploration of the global impact of the 1960s hymn 'Make Me a Channel of Your Peace'.

Quantified self: The tech-based route to a better life?,"Self-improvement has never been easier, thanks to apps and devices that measure all your everyday activities. But can you count your way to better health?",Karen Weintraub,2013-01-02 00:00:00,,"Another New Year, another list of resolutions to make… and no doubt break. For some, 2013 may begin by going to the gym, or giving up smoking. But what about a more thorough and personal approach towards self-improvement, like monitoring your thoughts, e-mails, or even your bowel movements? If the answer is yes, then perhaps this is the year that you’ll be joining a growing group of people who are using technology to measure their lives in extraordinary detail. Probably since the dawn of humanity, people have been fascinated by even the most minute details of their lives, and kept track of what was going on in their bodies and minds. The Roman philosopher Seneca tracked the food he ate and what he dreamt at night. Benjamin Franklin consistently recorded his performance on 13 measures, such as cleanliness, frugality and overindulgence, believing it would keep him virtuous. Engineer and architect Buckminster Fuller nicknamed himself “guinea pig b” and kept a diary on his daily life and ideas. But in the past, record-keeping was time-consuming, requiring a commitment that only a very few had the patience to muster. Others cared, but not THAT much. Today, that’s changing, as it becomes easier to track everything, from diet to mood to sleep quality. Smartphones come equipped with features like GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes that can record your activity, location and other vital statistics. Millions of fitness-focused or diet-conscious people track their workouts or their desserts with apps and devices like Fitbit that track physical activity or calories burned. New technology also makes it easier to share results with others – who doesn’t want to brag the first time they run more than 5 miles (8km), or be praised when they’ve managed to lose 10 pounds (5kg)? A growing band of devotees centered in the United States, called the Quantified Self movement, has taken the effort to another level. Its members track a whole list of measures and push the technology available to keep tabs on their ideas, their mental health, even their microbiome – the colonies of bacteria that live on or inside their bodies. Some might scoff at their efforts to keep spreadsheets documenting their mood, diet or sleep patterns. “But the insights that we could learn from having all this quantified self data available are almost unfathomable,” says Amy Robinson, an organiser of Quantified Self Boston, a group that includes about 650 members and holds bimonthly meet-ups to share ideas and progress. “Quantified self helps you keep a reference to how you lived not only the day before but two weeks before or a year before,” Robinson says. “You know when you achieve your best, you know when you exceed your best and it makes that possible by simply having the numbers there.” Yet such lofty personal goals come down to something that couldn’t be more mundane: manually recording the number of daily bowel movements or every bite of food consumed. Lawrence David spent a year tracking 300 measures about his health and behaviour – including the microbes in his digestive system – while he was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David created a self-tracking system by tinkering with an iPhone app designed to record and manage business cards. Every meal became a new “card” entry, with hundreds he had to type in by hand over the year – one night’s entry could be cheeseburger and fries, the next pepperoni pizza. “One of the few datasets out there is going to be full of junk food,” he says, confessing to a personal weakness. He got to the point where he hated the process so much that he didn’t want to eat because then he’d have to record it. “It was terrible,” he admits. “Super tedious.” But when his boss, associate professor Eric Alm, got food poisoning while self-tracking, it was the first time the microbial pattern of human diarrhoea had been followed in real-time. Sounds gross, but understanding the progress of food poisoning in such a manner could be an important step toward developing treatments for it. And other than confirming his love of junk food, he did learn some useful things about himself. David discovered that he wasted a lot of time on e-mail during the day, and wasn’t as productive as he thought he was late at night. Now, he saves most of his e-mailing for the evenings – instead of disrupting his research to respond – and doesn’t feel guilty when he takes a night off. He’s stopped tracking most of the other measures, though. Number power Like David, others who use technology to self-track rely on a mix of mind-numbing and automated measures, and they talk about the greater good, as well as what they’ve learned about themselves. The Quantified Self movement originated in San Francisco, after it was first proposed by Wired editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007. As of October 2012, the Quantified Self movement counted more than 70 meet-up groups worldwide with over 5,000 members – of course, they keep track of that sort of thing. (There’s actually a greater number of self-tracking apps on mobile phones than members – around 7,500 at the moment.) Many of these self-trackers are researchers, computer scientists, or simply tech-savvy, 21st-century Benjamin Franklins who think the act of collecting so much data has the power to transform themselves and the rest of society. Meet-ups are part 7-minute show-and-tells, part social hour. At her first meet-up, in Alabama, Amy Robinson was the only one who had tried quantifying anything, while other attendees were just curious about the idea. In Boston, as you might expect from being an academic and tech hub, many of the participants have developed their own hacks and want to trade tips on how to maximise their record-keeping. Robinson says she has long been fascinated with where ideas come from, so she started sending herself an e-mail whenever a good one popped into her head. Recently, she collected six months of these e-mails – 770 in all – analysed them, and presented the results at a Quantified Self meetup in Boston in October. Among the themes that came up most often were “science”, “beautiful” and “health.” She found that she had the most new ideas immediately after attending an inspiring conference, travelling or experiencing something new. Doing this exercise helped feed her fascination with the human mind, she told the group, as well as “discover more ways to think about myself and discover how my mind works relative to other people’s.” Melanie Swan, founder of DIYgenomics, a California-based non-profit that promotes personalised medicine, has presented her findings at several Bay Area meet-ups, and she says meet-up attendees have changed as the movement has evolved. At first, the typical person was obsessive, “someone who is really rigorous about self-tracking either because of a health reason or they’re compelled to improve their mental performance or whatever,” she says. “But who’s now at the meet-ups is a much broader slice, though I would say it’s still a pretty tech-forward thinking kind of audience – anybody interested in improving an aspect of their health.” Power of the nudge While their interest in self-quantification is technological, another factor is a more general one: the growing obsession with self-improvement over the past few decades, says Natasha Schull, a cultural anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Weight Watchers has been telling people since the 1970s that if they want to lose weight, they need to track what they eat. The field of behavioural economics, which studies the connection between thoughts and financial decisions, has found that if you alter peoples’ social environment, they might be nudged into conducting more rational behaviour. For instance, if school cafeterias display fruit before fried chicken, students are more likely to eat fruit because they grab the first food they see. And having people track their actions makes a difference, says Schull, encouraging more people to make the effort to track. Self-tracking might not have been such a fringe activity in the past, either. There were plenty of people keeping diaries and self-accounts in the 1800s and 1900s, says Schull. “Even having a watch and being mindful of time is a form of self-regulation that went along with industrialisation,” she says. As long as there have been people tracking themselves, there have been people mocking those trackers, Schull adds. D.H. Lawrence wrote a piece making fun of Franklin’s self-obsession and the cockiness embedded in his 13 virtues, including this description: “He was a little model, was Benjamin. Doctor Franklin. Snuff-coloured little man! Immortal soul and all!” Behind such insults lies the idea that tracking the minutiae of one’s life can be pointless, an end in itself. Others worry that it could be used for self-destructive purposes, like an anorexic tracking how little she eats. “It seems to me in the contemporary US example, the means and the end are blurring,” says Schull, who co-taught a class at Harvard University in the autumn called “Self as Data”. “I think people are still motivated – at least they say they are – by some kind of transformation, but it’s seen as something that doesn’t really end.” Like the Alcoholics Anonymous model, where people who were once alcoholics are always recovering, Schull says. “It’s a different model of what health is.” Weight and see For Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University, tracking his weight helped him keep it under control. “If you watch things, you tend to do better, by virtue of being aware of them,” says Gerstein, who has a wifi-enabled bathroom scale that automatically records his weight and feeds it into a database. Gerstein has also been tracking his asthma symptoms in hope of being able to reduce his medication. He says he sees a little correlation between his exercise and his peak air flow, and thinks the more he can measure about himself, the more he’ll know about what triggers his wheezing and the better he’ll be at controlling it. It’s not just Gerstein’s data that’s important, this kind of information from thousands of people who have asthma could become much more powerful when it’s aggregated. “There’s a whole other level of what happens when all this information flows together and you can look for patterns and trends,” he says. But not all self-quantification efforts are successful. Schull’s student, Sneha Khullar, began – reluctantly – tracking several measures as a class assignment. In her final presentation to the class in December, she explained that she enjoyed using a pedometer to track her footsteps and an app called RescueTime, which showed she is most productive on Fridays – now that she’s given up partying. But writing down everything she ate was too much of a drag, and piling up chocolate wrappers didn’t help her moderate her sweet tooth. According to Khullar, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, self-tracking needs to be easy enough to carry out routinely, but not so easy that it can be ignored. Having to convert miles into kilometres so she could figure out how much she had run required just enough effort to get her invested in the process, with an incentive to keep running more. “I could not have imagined I could run more than 5 miles,” she proudly told her classmates. But, these tools were way more successful in behaviour-enhancing than in controlling bad habits, she admitted. And perhaps this barrier to participation is key to whether self-tracking will fully make the leap from tech obsessives to the mainstream public. “It’s a question of when does it become easy and when does it become useful,” says Stephen Wolfram, creator of the technical computing software Mathematica. He says he’s been self-tracking for a quarter of a century – everything from his personal health to his e-mail to the use patterns of every room in his house. But there are some things even he declines to measure. He doesn’t bother with skin conductivity measures, for instance, because he doesn’t like wearing the devices. He doesn’t wear a camera around his neck, “because it’s not socially realistic for the life I lead – maybe if I were much younger.” And he doesn’t record his side of phone conversations because speech recognition software still isn’t good enough to provide an accurate transcript. Why would he want a transcript of every conversation? “Am I repeating myself? You can immediately check,” he says. Privacy matters The next crucial step for self-tracking, several people said, will be the ability to integrate different data streams. Right now, the wifi-enabled scale doesn’t talk to the program that monitors blood pressure, diet or sleep – but such integration will come eventually. Maybe someday it will even link up with “smart” toilets that can read shifting microbial populations and warn of impending illness. The key will be finding ways to make the data meaningful, rather than just overwhelming. And to keep it private. Yale’s Gerstein says he worries a lot about the privacy aspects of all thins data. Right now, it seems harmless to share information about our sleep patterns, genes and microbial populations. But one day, that information could be more meaningful – and could be used against us. Sleep patterns could be relevant, say, in a court case about a traffic accident. People who post genetic information now are revealing things about their future children and grandchildren. “I think the fear is people will pile up a lot of information about themselves and share it without fully seeing the implications,” Gerstein says. Robinson says there’s no question the Quantified Self movement she is part of will have to address privacy issues. “Let the people who want to share their data in a way that maintains their privacy, but also helps other people,” she says. And doctors are going to need to learn how to deal with all the data their patients are beginning to bring them. Right now, Robinson says, people in the Quantified Self movement “want to share their information with their doctor, but their doctor doesn’t really know what to do with it.” Wolfram, the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research and founder of the technology company Wolfram|Alpha, thinks the data will eventually redefine what doctors do. A doctor would be hard-pressed to make sense of the data once people are wired to track their heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood pressure and dozens of other measures. But computers will be able to easily spot patterns and trends, diagnosing far more accurately than doctors can today, and far earlier in the disease process, says Wolfram, who is developing analytics to meet this need. He thinks that eventually we’ll go from sensor-based data to being able to treat whatever concern the technology diagnoses. If so, perhaps a Quantified Selfer will figure out a way to measure whether this actually improves our health.

Paul Gascoigne given suspended drink-driving sentence,Former footballer Paul Gascoigne is given an eight-week suspended sentence after admitting driving while over the legal alcohol limit.,,9 December 2010,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Gascoigne arriving at Newcastle Magistrates Court for sentencing Former footballer Paul Gascoigne has been given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted drinking and driving. The 43-year-old Tyneside-born former England midfielder was stopped by police in Newcastle on 8 October. The citys magistrates court was told that Gascoigne was more than four times the legal alcohol limit. He was handed an eight-week sentence, suspended for a year, and banned from driving for three years. He was also given an alcohol treatment order. The court was told Gascoigne was five weeks into a 12-week anti-drink programme in Dorset. Gascoigne, who played top flight football for Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough in a career spanning nearly 20 years, also attends Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings. I hope not to see you again District Judge Stephen Earl Profile: Paul Gascoigne His solicitor Stephen Andrews said: ""The talk now is of an extensive and elongated period of support while not actually under the roof of the Providence Project, but certainly within easy reach, given the continued support they would propose to offer. ""Previously, it has been on his terms. Hes gone in, he has used it as he saw fit and of course relapsed because he has not done the full programme. ""This time it has been on their terms."" District Judge Stephen Earl said he believed a 12-week sentence, with a third off as credit for a guilty plea, was appropriate. He said the sentence was suspended in recognition of Gascoignes progress in the treatment programme. Toon Army He warned the former footballer that if he re-offended in the next 12 months, the jail term would be triggered. District Judge Earl added: ""I hope not to see you again."" Gascoigne made no comment when he left court, but Mr Andrews said he was relieved and that it was a ""good result"". Outside the court well-wishers shouted, ""Toon Army never surrenders"", and he signed autographs for fans.

The vehicle - which sported a Manchester City pendant on the passenger window - was pushed free by members of the press.

Street Doctor in Chester,"Four GPs hit the streets of Chester for an open urban surgery an episode of BBC ONE's Street Doctor and advise patients about female hair loss, snoring, giving up smoking, and  skin cancer.",,None,,"The Street Doctors visit the historic Roman city of Chester. Chester is the county city of Cheshire. The area is known as a healthy place to live but with binge drinking higher than the England average and diabetes cases on the increase the Street Doctors still have their work cut out. Dr Ayan starts his day down by the River Dee where he meets Rahima who is worried about female hair loss. Dr Ayans diagnosis of Rahima is that her hair loss is probably due to excessive dying of her hair in the past. However, female hair loss can be related to hormone levels, particularly sex hormones like oestrogen and progesterone and also the hormones produced by the thyroid gland. If youre a woman whos concerned about hair loss Dr Ayan advises: - Cut down on the number and frequency of hairstyling products you use on a regular basis. - Look at your diet and lifestyle - poor nutrition can have a detrimental effect on hair. - Look at the stress levels in your life and whether you can reduce them. - If you need further help visit your GP. Dr Barbara visits a sandwich factory where she meets Ali who has a problem with snoring and is a smoker. Alis snoring is so bad that it often wakes his partner. Dr Barbara explains that generally snoring is caused because the soft palate at the back of the throat (where the dangly bit or uvula is) is weaker. Smoking effects your breathing and your nasal passages and is likely to make snoring worse. Dr Barbara tests Alis lung capacity with a spirometer and finds that Alis peak flow is much lower than it should be and his lungs are 10 years older than his actual age. Giving up smoking would improve his health generally but should also make his snoring better. However, Dr Barbara advises that he could ask to be referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist to get further advice about his snoring problem. If youd like to give up smoking Dr Barbara says: - It can take up to 8 attempts so commitment is vital if you are to succeed. - Chose a nicotine replacement method which suits your circumstances such as gum, patches or an inhalator. - If necessary, attend a support service at your local GPs clinic. - Have a clear time scale in mind. - If youre struggling see your GP for further help and support. Dr Jonty goes to Cheshire Ice-Cream Farm where he bumps into a Malcolm who has a mole behind his ear that he is worried about. Malcolm explains that it appeared about 3 months ago, he cut it shaving and it hasnt healed since. Dr Jonty inspects the mole and is concerned because the mole isnt healing and it has the appearance of a smooth edge with ulceration in the centre. This leads Dr Jonty to think its possibly a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) which is a form of skin cancer. This is different and not as dangerous as malignant melanoma, the more aggressive type of skin cancer, because it doesnt spread to other parts of the body. However, Dr Jonty tells Malcolm he must go to his GP and get the mole removed and sent for testing at a lab as soon as possible. The sun is responsible for 90% of all skin cancers. If you want to reduce your risk Dr Jonty advises: - Stay out of the sun during hottest times and make sure you dont get burnt. - Cover up when outdoors in the middle of the day. - Always wear at least factor 15 sunscreen. - If you have any skin growth that wont heal or changes in size, colour or shape - see your GP.",{},"['jonty', 'street', 'doctor', 'malcolm', 'barbara', 'mole', 'hair', 'snoring', 'skin', 'chester', 'smoking', 'dr', 'loss']","Dr Ayan's diagnosis of Rahima is that her hair loss is probably due to excessive dying of her hair in the past.

He had many friends with him when he was drinking cause he pays for the drinks most of the time. He will drink until late into the night. During this time he forgets his wife, children and home. He owns a Mercedes but he need not have to drive his car. His friends will come and pick him up. Just last year his health deteriorated. He was warned by the doctor to stop drinking immediately. What happened? All his friends deserted him. Most of them did not even visit him when he was warded in hospital for about a month. I call all of them FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS So please beware of such kind of friends. They know you only during drinking session. Get rid of alcohol and you will automatically get rid of these kind of friends. Jade Shaw Hi, I have had that experience myself. It doesnt do any good and doesnt help at all but at the end I got through it with lots of help from close family & friends. I hope everything goes alright for you and you get through. Good Luck. x David I am so pleased to see the links to Alcoholics Anonymous. As a health professional, as well as a recovering alcoholic, I am well aware that most health workers involved with Alcoholics ignore AA despite the fact that it seems to be more effective at helping people recover than anything else. Alcohol misuse is an enormous problem which needs to be addressed more sincerely by the government - thank you for highlighting it Mick Knight Thanks to Lani for this first-hand view of alcohol and alcoholism. I recently attended a seminar in which the speaker, a person experienced in the field of drug and alcohol abuse, said that of all addictions she feared alcohol the most. The majority of drug abusers will eventually kick their habit, but this is not so with alcoholics. Perhaps thats because there isnt the stigma attached to alcohol and it is a legal stimulant? Julia Thanks for talking about the dangers of alcohol. It is a drug which causes many problems. I hope things work out for you. Renata Macfarlane Alot of young people dont realise that alcohol is a deadly addictive drug and its so easy to get it.

"Woman's Hour, Living with an alcoholic; Graduate earnings; Japanese women",Why a University degree is worth more to women than to men.,,None,BBC,"Now the A Level results are out, a new set of young women and men will be going on to University or out in to the job market. New research by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, has found that men who go on to Higher Education will (over the course of their lifetime) earn on average £165,000 more than men who do not attend University at all. However for women, that figure rises to £250,000. The study also found that women who drop out of their degrees are likely to suffer a wage ‘penalty’ – going on to earn less over their lifetime than women who never attended Higher Education at all.

Hooked on alcohol,Three alcoholics share their experience of addiction and treatment at Sunderland's Lazarus centre.,,2005-03-30 00:00:00,,"Andrea is an alcoholic. Shes been going through a re-hab programme at the Lazarus Centre in Sunderland for the past 10 weeks. Shes in her late 20s and her drinking became a problem about six years ago. Andreas story Andreas story ""It started when I met my husband. Hes a violent person, not that Im with him now. I started drinking to look as if I was happy. ""I knew there was a problem: I had to have it. I was drinking between four to six cans and half a bottle of vodka a day"". Things got worse. Andrea had separated from her husband by now, but Social Services knew about her problems. ""Social Services were going to make orders to take the children, to have them removed if I didnt change my ways, change my drinking, but I just couldnt stop. Even the thought of the children going into care didnt stop me"". ""Its a cycle - you get up, drink, pass out, wake up, drink."" Keith Family troubles Her two young daughters were eventually taken into care. Andreas hoping that if she gets through the programme, she will eventually get them back, but she knows she cant leave the Lazarus Centre until both she and her social worker are confident she wont lapse back into drinking. ""At the moment, they dont want to put me back into society - it might trigger me off into going for a drink again. Ive got the children to think about - the court date is soon. I want to prove to the judge and the court that Ive stopped drinking"". Andrea knows she can never have an alcoholic drink again. ""Its the first drink - once you have that, the cravings come back and you want another and another, and it just leads you back down that road again. Ive wasted five years of my life on drink"". Help and treatment The Lazarus Centre uses a 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, but in group sessions, and all the clients are residential for the course of their treatment, which can last from three months to a year. As clients start to progress and realise they want to change their lives, they are allowed home at weekends, but random alcohol tests mean that if they do lapse, they have to leave the programme. The centre claims a high success rate for those who do stay the course. Keiths story Keiths story Keith hasnt had a drink for over two years now. He went through the programme at the Lazarus Centre, and now works there looking after the maintenance of the building. With some distance from his lowest point, he is able to look back with a great deal of self-knowledge. ""I could go through a bottle and a half of vodka a day and eight to ten cans. Its a cycle - you get up, drink, pass out, wake up, drink. ""Its alright people saying its a question of willpower - it goes beyond that. Its addiction in the true sense of the word. ""I begged a doctor to section me. You reach a point - rock bottom - when youre so desperate to get out of it youll do anything. Its either that or die"". Andys battle Andy has just joined the programme at the Lazarus Centre after ending up in hospital in April. Hes been battling with drink for 15 years. Now that hes finally admitted he has a problem, he can see the bizarre logic he used to apply to his life. Andys story ""I dont smoke because its bad for you, but Ill drink a bottle and a half of whisky. I dont take drugs because I know I have a compulsive nature. ""But this is the good one - I dont take paracetamol because someone told me they damage your liver. So when I had a headache coming out of an alcohol stupor, I wouldnt take paracetamol in case I hurt my liver. After 30 bottles of Scotch!"" To get in touch with Lazarus Centre > Alcoholics Anonymous > The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites Your comments The Have your say section is now closed, but here are some of your comments: James Lots of material on alcoholism seems to be blaming someone or something for triggering the addiction. I believe my alcoholism was a latent disease waiting to be triggered by my first drink. So much treatment is centred around a defined period of time - sign up, do treatment, signed off cured. My experience is that alcoholics and addicts for that matter, need the support of a twelve step programme and other recovering people for the rest of their lives. Relapse rates are very high with this support and without it alcoholics seem to often slide back into active addiction. Professionals are often well intentioned but nothing helps an alcoholic like another recovering alcoholic. This is how I have stayed sober for more than 8 years. Gavin Ackroyd The recent statistics that have prompted tonights news story are the affect of past drinking habits, not recent ones. You dont drink heavily for a few months and then die, it is the result of past drinking habits, take Andys story he has been ""battling with drink for 15 years"". People should look at the bigger picture. Project5000 I know that there are many differnt reasons why people drink excessively. We are a pub culture and this has got to change. There has to be an alternative. This is why there is a group of us who have set up a compnay to create a non-alcoholic bar for young people 12-25 years. All we need is a property that is as attractive as a pub and off course the money.

Based in Southall the group is sensitive to the needs of the large migrant population, they feel are not accessing the help that they desperately need. Theyve produced a number of videos in Panjabi, Urdu, Mirpuri, Bengali (Sylhet) and Gujrati in a bid to reach out. In a report Perminder Dhillon from DAAP says: ""It has been evident for a number of years that Black and minority ethnic communities do not have the same access to appropriate and relevant drugs education, prevention and treatment services as the indigenous community.

Peston's Picks: First strike ever looms at AA,"The first strike in its 105 year history is looming at the AA. Alistair MacLean, the National Secretary of the AA's union, the Independent Democratic Union (IDU), has told me...",,None,,"The first strike in its 105 year history is looming at the AA. Alistair MacLean, the National Secretary of the AAs union, the Independent Democratic Union (IDU), has told me that a strike ballot of 5000 members will be announced tomorrow, unless there is a last-minute change of heart on plans to cap benefits in two AA pension schemes. The AAs management wants to put a ceiling on annual rises in pensionable salaries (the salaries that qualify for a pension), to raise employee contributions and also to reduce the maximum annual rise in pensions paid to 2 ½ per cent a year. The AA is part of a conglomerate called Acromas, which also owns Saga, the travel and financial services company that sells to those over 50. Acromas, led by Andrew Goodsell, is aiming to reduce a £190m deficit in the pension scheme. The final-salary scheme is closed to new joiners, but Acromas believes it is being more generous than some other companies in keeping the scheme open for contributions to existing members. The dispute will bring back memories of tensions between employees and management after the motorcar emergency breakdown service was bought by the private equity firms Permira and CVC in the summer of 2004. The AA became the lightning rod for criticisms that private equity firms were asset strippers that load up companies with dangerous quantities of debt. In June 2007, the AA was merged with SAGA to form Acromas. The merger yielded huge profits for CVC, Permira and for SAGAs owner, Charterhouse. The three private equity firms retain big stakes in Acromas, which is said to have performed pretty well in the recession. Mr MacLean said rumours were rife that Acromas was being groomed for a flotation, which could again see vast profits generated for its owners. However I understand that Acromas will not be joining the stampede of companies that are endeavouring to be sold on the stock market over the coming three months.",{},"['pestons', 'pension', 'looms', 'private', 'scheme', 'companies', 'strike', 'picks', 'aa', 'firms', 'union', 'equity', 'acromas']","The first strike in its 105 year history is looming at the AA.

Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Ramesh Tawadkar said treatment would be offered to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders to make them ""normal"". Many have taken to social networking sites to criticise Mr Tawadkars ""shocking statement"". Indias treatment of homosexuals has been under the spotlight recently. The Indian Supreme Courts 2013 decision to reverse a lower court order striking down a 153-year-old British colonial-era law criminalising homosexual acts caused global outrage with many describing it as ""disgraceful"". According to Section 377 of the law, a same-sex relationship is an ""unnatural offence"" and punishable by a 10-year jail term. A BBC correspondent in Delhi says although the law has rarely - if ever - been used to prosecute anyone for consensual sex, it has often been used by the police to harass homosexuals. Also, in deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate and our correspondent says Mr Tawadkars comment is an endorsement of that conservative thought. ""We will make LGBT [lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth normal. We will have a centre for them... like Alcoholics Anonymous centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" Mr Tawadkar said on Monday while discussing the Bharatiya Janata Party-run state governments policy report on youth. ""As in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out of the LGBT community so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" the minister added. The ministers statement has led to outrage in India with many people condemning it on social media sites like Twitter.

"Thought for the Day, Thought for the Day",Rev Dr Giles Fraser,,None,BBC,"“Christian morality is a thing so strange that it must be declared immoral according to all other codes of morality”: so writes the distinguished theologian John Milbank. And few plays demonstrate this unsettling perspective more directly than the Tirso De Molina’s remarkable 17th century drama, Damned by Despair, which began its run of previews at the National Theatre last night. It’s a play that’s bound to confuse those who think of Christianity as fundamentally a system of ethics because it tells of a pious morally upright hermit who goes to hell and a murderous gangster who goes to heaven. In moral terms, this simply doesn’t figure. But for traditional catholic Christianity, morality is something of a side issue. The central concern of Christianity is with salvation not morality. Damned by Despair sets these two perspectives against each other. The earliest battle between these different understandings was set up between Pelagius and Augustine. Pelagius argued that Christianity was fundamentally about being good, a question of keeping all the rules. And those who keep the rules go to heaven, those who don’t go to hell. It’s that simple. So why was Pelagius’ teaching rejected by the church? Because, argued Augustine, ‘being good’ is never that simple. Anticipating Freud, Augustine insisted that human beings are more complicated, more driven by mixed and unacknowledged motives, more compromised by our nature. Whereas Pelagius’ sunny view of the human condition makes virtue seem entirely straightforward, Augustine argued we are not programmed for easy virtue. His called it “original sin” – which is more an existential than a moral category, not so much about individual misdeeds than about human beings being fundamentally broken. For Augustine, then, human beings need to be fixed. And this fixing is so profound that only God is capable of doing it. As with Alcoholics Anonymous, the first thing is to admit that you have a problem and that you cannot sort it out yourself. Then you need to ask for help. That is the difference between the two main characters of the play: one knows he is flawed, the other does not. One asks for help, the other thinks he can do it alone. Unlike De Molina, I don’t believe in hell in any literal sense. But his point still stands. Christianity is not a self-help programme for being good with eternal rewards attached. Quite the reverse: it’s an admission of incapacity. More a cry for help than an assertion of our intrinsic virtue. It’s easy to caricature this as self-flagellation, but I see it as an honest assertion of the human condition. The message of Damned by Despair is as disturbing today as it was in the seventeenth century: those who trust in their own virtue are often the most lost of all.",{},"['augustine', 'hell', 'despair', 'christianity', 'good', 'fundamentally', 'thought', 'human', 'pelagius', 'virtue', 'day', 'morality']","But for traditional catholic Christianity, morality is something of a side issue.

Weekend edition: The best of the week's reads,A collection of some of the best reads from the BBC News website this week.,,20 March 2015,BBC News,"A collection of some of the best reads from the BBC News website this week, with an injection of your comments. Lots of readers have been commenting on the short clip of Sirga the lioness rushing to hug the man who rescued her when she was a cub. When Valentin Gruener opens her cage, Sirga ecstatically throws her paws around his neck. Allan Ainsworth says on Facebook that it shows ""animals know - and recognise - kindness"". It reminds him of a story ""where two fellas had a lion cub from Harrods"". Allan recalls that the lion was rehoused in Africa. ""The two guys went out some time later… It threw itself at them both in an embrace of love and fondness."" Allan has remembered correctly, and in that reunion in 1972, Christian the lion reacts in a very similar way to Sirga. The lion hugger Scoop of the 60s Image copyright Getty Images Heres an unusual way to get a scoop: hide your camera in a bouzouki guitar. One tip though, this may only work if youre trying to get a story in the kind of place where there are actually bouzouki players. Stumped for the kind of place where there are bouzouki guitars? Try a Greek shipping magnates yacht. Thats where young Greek journalist Nico Mastorakis sneaked on to get the scoop that Jackie Kennedy was going to marry Aristotle Onassis. For Christiane Vejlo this was an insight into the early days of paparazzi work, while Joanna Williams thinks it tells us something about press freedom 40 years ago.

Alex Duval Smith walked into the tax office and was told,  You have the choice between two income tax regimens, 30% or 3%, which shall it be?  She went for 3%. And thats how they do tax in Mali. Theres a logic to this. The government believes the 3% rate will attract more tax payers. At the moment they struggle to raise 1% or 2%.

There had been a 20mph speed limit set in 1903 but it was repealed in 1930. The spate of deaths caused a change of heart in government in 1934 and the 30mph limit was brought in. But it still has its opponents. They argue speed limits dont improve safety because drivers just focus on speedometers. Transport researcher Anna Plyushteva responds to that argument on Twitter with one word: hilarity. How did the UK get the 30mph limit?

That is the question underlying a lawsuit targeting the French company Gleeden.

Meanwhile, Gleedens advertising campaign is a woman in a wedding dress with her fingers crossed behind her back. Indeed, Gleeden says 80% of the people who use it are indeed married.

Stafford bishop accuses government over alcohol abuse,,,2011-06-01 11:51:59,,"The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse. The Rt Rev Geoff Annas has described alcohol misuse as ""one of the major sins of our time"". Writing in a pastoral letter, published in parish magazines across the Diocese of Lichfield, he called for a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes towards drinking. The government has said it is tackling alcohol-related crime ""at its source"" through a variety of measures. He said charities were left to tackle the effects of ""this drug abuse"", with government action not going far enough. Major sin In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales. They said banning shops and bars from selling drinks for less than the tax paid on them would cut crime and set a ""base price"" for the first time. It works out at 38p for a can of weak lager and £10.71 for a litre of vodka. In the letter, Mr Annas said: ""One definition of sin is anything that comes between us and God and makes us less than the person God created us to be. ""Alcohol abuse is one of the major sins of our time - and it is one that governments do very little to prevent. ""Instead, it is left to amazing organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous or in the inspirational OConnor Gateway Charitable Trust, of which I am proud to be a trustee, to tackle the effects of this drug abuse."" Drink at home ""Binge-drinking"" was not the fault of pub and nightclub owners, he said, nor was it down to an extension in opening hours. ""The extension of the licensing laws means that they can stay open later but in reality many [people] now do not even arrive until 11 at night,"" said Mr Annas. ""Prior to this they drink in their own homes, consuming alcohol which they have purchased very cheaply in their local supermarket or corner shop. ""The government has introduced minimum pricing but the level it has been set is derisory."" A Home Office spokesman said the government was tackling alcohol related crime at its source by taking tough action against irresponsible premises, giving communities a chance to have a say over licensing and allowing councils to charge more for late licences. ""And we havent just stood by while suppliers let drink be sold so cheaply that it leads to drunken violence, weve taken steps to ensure that by the end of the year the sale of alcohol below cost is banned,"" the spokesman said.",{},"['crime', 'price', 'sins', 'bishop', 'tackle', 'set', 'spokesman', 'alcohol', 'stafford', 'source', 'mr', 'abuse', 'tackling', 'accuses']","The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse.

'I survived abuse - now I'm starting to date at 47',"Matt is a virgin, but wants to start a family. So, for the first time, he's immersing himself in the world of online dating.",,13 May 2019,BBC News,"At 47, Matt is a virgin, but wants to settle down and start a family. So, for the first time, he is immersing himself in the world of online dating. Matt Carey is struggling to find the right words to describe himself on his online dating profile. ""Youre an attractive man. Youre lovely, intelligent and funny,"" suggests his friend Maddy, who is helping him. Matt responds with a self-deprecating laugh. ""You dont have to reveal too much when you first meet someone,"" Maddy advises. Matt is wary. ""This is all new,"" he says, betraying the nervousness he feels at putting himself out on the dating scene. According to his friends, Matt is a catch - a kind, attractive man who has had a successful career in theatre management since moving to London from his childhood home in the West Country. But, despite his confident appearance, Matt has struggled with intimacy his entire adult life. At 47, he is a still a virgin, though he is desperate to find a partner, settle down and start a family. Find out more Matt tells his story to Sarah Bowen on BBC Radio 4s The Untold on Monday 13 May at 11:00 Listen again on iPlayer or download The Untold podcast ""For so long in my life I shut down the possibilities of it. I lived in a fantasy world or put women on a pedestal as a means to not do anything,"" he says. Matts fears around forming close relationships stem from his childhood in a south-west coastal town. He counts himself lucky to have grown up in an affluent area, with two older siblings and plenty of friends to play with in the parks and sand dunes at the local beach. Then one hot day when he was eight, after playing football, he walked into a public lavatory. Two men followed him into the small, confined space. Image caption Matt aged eight One of the men complimented him on his playing, saying he remembered Matt had once waved to them from the football pitch. Matt said he didnt recognise them. But the men persisted, calling Matt a liar and saying they would tell his headmaster about his rude behaviour. At this point, one of men feigned a pain in his groin area. The other told Matt that it was his fault as he had hurt the mans feelings. He said Matt needed to rub the mans groin to make him feel better. Matt says he knew this wasnt right and started to cry. The men kept insisting that Matt do what they wanted, putting more and more pressure on him. In the end, he relented. ""I remember going home and Mum saying to me: Whats wrong?,"" he says. Matt hardly ate that night. He says it is hard to overestimate the sense of confusion and guilt he experienced. He didnt think he could tell his parents because he felt in some way responsible for what had happened. ""It was like being in a car crash. You dont know what the hells going on. So you shut down and pretend nothing has happened,"" he says. Even though he had been deeply shaken by the experience, Matt saw his abusers again for the next 18 months. He was assaulted on more than 30 occasions in 12 different public toilets and, once, in a private flat. One time, other men and children joined in. ""They control you by threatening you that things will get worse,"" he says, explaining why he kept going back to the men. ""Theres a presence of evil. Youre scared they might kill you so you go along with it. ""The complicity control is a lot worse than the abuse - the threats, the evil atmosphere."" Image copyright BBCV School photographs from this time show the effect the abuse had on Matts childhood. A photo from before shows him happy and smiling with a messy mop of blonde hair. A photo from a year later shows that he had pulled out much of his hair. When the abuse eventually stopped, Matt made a promise to himself that no-one would ever hurt him again. He says it was like something inside him shut down. ""For a lot of my adult life Ive had real problems with sexual intimacy,"" he says, although he wanted a sexual relationship. ""For years I imagined sex to be something really deeply uncomfortable and horrific."" Becoming a teenager was difficult. Matt says he longed for a pill to stop his developing sexual feelings. He felt confused and ashamed - dirty on the inside, even though outwardly he was a bit of a lad. ""It was all a front,"" he says. Image caption Matt aged 12, after the abuse had stopped ""Any girl showing me interest, particularly any girl coming on to me, I just ran away from. My fear was ultimately at some point, they might want to have sex."" Playing rugby helped him express his feelings, especially the rage he felt inside. Aggressively tackling other players became a way of coping with the sense of intimidation he felt in the presence of other men. Another emotional crutch was alcohol. Matt began drinking at the age of 15. By 17 he was stealing to fund his habit and by his late teens, he was dependent on alcohol to get through the day. ""Initially I drank because of the buzz because I felt much better being drunk than being sober,"" he says. Matts drinking became so extreme that he started experiencing blackouts, tremors and palpitations. Once, after a big night out, he had a hallucination of Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini standing beside his bed. Instead of stopping, he decided to drink more. Eventually, at the age of 20, Matt had a breakdown and was kicked out of university. He returned to living with his parents, knowing he needed help. This led him to Alcoholics Anonymous where he found a sense of spirituality that became the basis for his healing.

For years he had told no-one about what he had been through. ""You feel so complicit and the manipulation forces your silence so you dont tell people - you go out of your way to hide it. Its a conscious denial to survive,"" he says. A psychologist encouraged Matt to open up to his parents. Initially, Matt was cautious, not wanting to hurt them. And, although he knew they were not responsible for the abuse, he felt angry that they hadnt been there to protect him. He says it was easier to speak to his sister, Caroline. ""It was feelings of guilt - why wasnt I there for him? I was the older bossy sister who thought I looked out for him, so it was quite upsetting to find out this had happened and I was completely oblivious of it,"" she says. Caroline considered advising Matt to go to the police, but she realised there would be no evidence for a prosecution. Instead, she offered to do whatever her brother needed to help him heal and live a full life. Over the years, Matt has been helped by various forms of therapy and by travelling to India and Brazil. He has learnt to manage his emotional triggers and get over his feelings of discomfort about being physically close to another person. Image caption Matt travelling in India in 2016 But the results have come slowly. Matt says it took him 20 years before he was able to fully remember the coercion and threats made by the paedophile ring. He says it was only then that he knew, on a deep emotional level, that the abuse had not been his fault. ""This has allowed me to move forward and let go of the shame,"" he says. As Matt has become more open about the abuse he suffered, his confidence has grown. He now helps others who have been through similar experiences, and is considering joining a NSPCC campaign which helps children know where to turn if they are abused. Hes also found the confidence to put his own story into words, in a self-published book. But in his personal life, Matts progress has been more hesitant. Although he finished writing his dating profile, for months, he held back making it live. In particular, he worried that dates would ask him to explain why he didnt drink and why he hadnt been in a relationship before. He worried that his only experience of sex was the abuse, and that he had never had a relationship based on equality, sharing, kindness and love. Image caption Matt at a charity ball in January 2019 ""If anyone on a date senses someone is holding something back, it can raise alarm bells. Maybe its best to be open,"" he says. Finally he summoned the courage to post his profile online. Almost immediately he received some promising responses. Now Matt is ready for his first date arranged through the website - a coffee with a woman with whom he feels he has a lot in common. He says he is trying hard not to over-think what he will say and what he will do. He feels has made a massive step forward. ""So much of the shame around the abuse has left me, so I dont feel I need to apologise for the after-effects,"" Matt says. ""Im more accepting that Im scared, but I also feel excited as well that there is an opportunity - that my life isnt about the abuse. ""It isnt everything."" Matt Carey is a pseudonym.

The many groups that have copied Alcoholics Anonymous,Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion.,,9 June 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright Other Image caption An AA meeting depicted on the Sopranos Alcoholics Anonymous was founded 80 years ago. It has spawned a host of other groups dealing with every manner of compulsion, writes Chris Stokel-Walker. ""My name is Peter and Im an alcoholic."" Its a familiar phrase even to those who have never attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. When Peter introduces himself to 40 others in a small room just off Newcastles main shopping thoroughfare, on a sunny Saturday morning, he receives a warm welcome back in unison. Everyone here shares a drink dependency, though they come from hugely different walks of life. The format of the meeting is simple - an introduction, a reading, one member explaining their story, then a free-for-all discussion for others to share their concerns, their triumphs, and their thoughts. Peter began to drink at the age of 11. ""By the age of legal drinking in the UK I was being admitted to local alcoholic units; in and out of doctors; in and out of police cells. Everything in my life really deteriorated."" But Peter hasnt tasted alcohol in 34 years, and he attributes his sobriety to Alcoholics Anonymous. All members talk about ""working through the 12 steps"" that form the cornerstone of the programme. The first of the steps, published four years after AA began, reads: ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable."" The 12 steps outline a plan of recovery to overcome addiction, which involves submitting to a higher spiritual power and admitting that alcoholism is an ongoing problem. Founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith in Akron, Ohio, AA grew out of a Christian organisation - the Oxford Group. Image copyright ALAMY Image caption The 12-step recovery programme for Narcotics Anonymous are the same for AA The group is marking 80 years from the moment Wilson helped Smith - 10 June 1935 was the latters last drink. That social element of AA, the importance of ""sponsors"" in the process, is as well known as any of the steps. Today, there are 115,326 Alcoholics Anonymous groups in 175 different countries, according to the groups latest estimates, with more than two million members. There are 60,143 groups in the United States alone. According to a study in 1998, 90% of private substance abuse treatment centres based in the US model their treatment on the 12 steps. The principles have provided a basis for other 12-steps groups with no affiliation to mainstream AA. THE 12 STEPS We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs Source: Alcoholics Anonymous Great Britain These include Narcotics Anonymous, the more specific Marijuana Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. Clutterers Anonymous deals with those with hoarding problems. Underearners Anonymous offers support for those suffering an ""inability to provide for ones needs"". Support for loved ones of those going through addiction is on offer at Families Anonymous. On Monday alone there were four Narcotics Anonymous meetings in Manchester, a Marijuana Anonymous meeting in Fitzrovia, central London, and an Overeaters Anonymous session in Cannock. For some of the smaller groups, if theres no dedicated meeting available, addicts are advised to go to AA as a substitute. Across England, Wales and Scotland, 687 different Alcoholics Anonymous meetings took place on Monday, with 113 chapters coming together in London alone. ""If you look at any 12-step programme, the only significant difference really is the first part of the first step,"" says Peter, who attends AA meetings and organises Emotions Anonymous meetings in the North East of England. The latter group deals with issues as diverse as low self-esteem, resentment, fear, anger, indecision, perfectionism, forgiveness, depression, grief, shame and anxiety. ""I think theres a fellowship for every particular human condition,"" Peter jokes. ""But I can understand that, because apart from the first part of the first step, the rest of the programme is a programme for living."" Image copyright Other Image caption AA meeting depicted in the House of Cards Most fellowships offer Skype sessions, where youll be greeted in the same way, any hour of the day by welcoming peers always happy to listen, and youll say the same words: ""My name is… and Im addicted to …"" ""The 12 steps are very applicable to any other addiction,"" says Amy Krentzman of the University of Minnesotas School of Social Work, who has conducted research into Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programmes. ""They modify the language, but its the same basic programme, the same basic steps, and other people have got well from following them."" The ""helper"" theory, first coined in the 1960s, helps explain AAs efficacy, says Krentzman. The helper ends up feeling better too. Most, if not all, of those running 12-step groups are themselves undergoing treatment for addiction. In countless movies and TV shows - from the Sopranos to Mad Men to House of Cards to the West Wing - the sponsor-addict relationship crops up. Sponsors act as a spiritual, emotional and practical guide. Treatment is always ongoing in AA, unlike some other traditional rehabilitation programmes which offer short programmes followed by the addict coping largely alone. Marijuana Anonymous has ""exactly the same format"", explains Thomas, a member. ""It has the 12 steps, and various stories that illustrate the practical application of those steps, and stories from people who have gone through the experience and gone sober."" These spin-off groups are not explicitly endorsed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), which oversees the organisations copyrights. But AAWS does grant permission for groups to use the 12 steps. Image copyright Alamy And AAs principles are still regularly criticised. Some dislike the quasi-religious element, others the emphasis on complete abstinence rather than the possibility of moderate consumption. Theres also a new film - The 13th Step - about sexual assaults carried out by AA members on other members. But perhaps the greatest criticism is from those who want concrete evidence that this widely accepted programme actually produces results. ""The evidence is that it works very well for some people,"" says Krentzman. A review of scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous success in aiding sobriety in 2006 found that ""no experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA"". Dr Lance Dodes, a former substance abuse treatment specialist, wrote in a book about 12-step programmes that: ""Alcoholics Anonymous was proclaimed the correct treatment for alcoholism over 75 years ago despite the absence of any scientific evidence of the approachs efficacy, and we have been on the wrong path ever since."" Another bone of contention is that porting across the 12-step programme to other areas offers cultural legitimacy to the idea of a wide range of compulsions as addictive diseases. Scientists continue to be divided over whether food addiction really exists. They are torn as to whether sex addiction is real or not. It does not, for example, appear in the American Psychiatric Associations list of mental disorders. But for many, the programme is effective. Krentzman notes: ""It works because of a psychological process, a social process, a spiritual process. Because of the way it gives people a sense of community and knowing other people who have the same problem."" Thats something Jennifer, who attends Overeaters Anonymous, agrees with. She joined the group in 2008, when she was 37 years old and 17-and-a-half stone. Today, she is at a more manageable weight, and attributes that to her ongoing relationship with the fellowship of overeaters. ""When Id been to therapists and they were telling me to try things, they had no experience of it themselves,"" she says. ""Theres something about one addict helping another addict. There was an authenticity to what they were saying."" ""Its a very simple programme for complicated people,"" Thomas says, ""and it seems to withstand a lot of questioning from outside and within, which cant be said for a lot of rehab philosophies."" In the AA meeting in Newcastle, 40 people sit and share stories of addiction. Aftewards, there are firm handshakes and friendly conversations - smiles and shared jokes. One by one, they file out the door into the crowds toting shopping bags, looking like anyone else. But in their mind, they carry an extra weight with them throughout the week.

Alcoholics Anonymous - Great Britain,,,None,,"The Birth of AA, its Growth and the Start of AA in Great Britain AA had its beginnings in 1935 at Akron, Ohio, as the outcome of a meeting between Bill W., a New York stockbroker, and Dr. Bob S., an Akron surgeon. Both had been hopeless alcoholics. Prior to that time, Bill and Dr. Bob had each been in contact with the Oxford Group, a mostly non-alcoholic fellowship that emphasized universal spiritual values in daily living. In that period, the Oxford Groups in America were headed by the noted Episcopal clergyman, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker. Under this spiritual influence, and with the help of an old-time friend, Ebby T., Bill had gotten sober and had then maintained his recovery by working with other alcoholics, though none of these had actually recovered. Meanwhile, Dr. Bobs Oxford Group membership at Akron had not helped him enough to achieve sobriety. When Dr. Bob and Bill finally met, the effect on the doctor was immediate. This time, he found himself face to face with a fellow sufferer who had made good. Bill emphasized that alcoholism was a malady of mind, emotions and body. This all-important fact he had learned from Dr. William D. Silkworth of Towns Hospital in New York, where Bill had often been a patient. Though a physician, Dr. Bob had not known alcoholism to be a disease. Responding to Bills convincing ideas, he soon got sober, never to drink again. The founding spark of Alcoholics Anonymous had been struck. Both men immediately set to work with alcoholics at Akrons City Hospital, where one patient quickly achieved complete sobriety. Though the name Alcoholics Anonymous had not yet been coined, these three men actually made up the nucleus of the first AA group. In the fall of 1935, a second group of alcoholics slowly took shape in New York. A third appeared at Cleveland in 1939. It had taken over four years to produce 100 sober alcoholics in the three founding groups. Early in 1939, the Fellowship published its basic textbook, Alcoholics Anonymous. The text, written by Bill, explained AAs philosophy and methods, the core of which was the now well-known Twelve Steps of recovery. The book was also reinforced by case histories of some thirty recovered members. From this point, AAs development was rapid. Also in 1939, the Cleveland Plain Dealer carried a series of articles about AA, supported by warm editorials. The Cleveland group of only twenty members was deluged by countless pleas for help. Alcoholics sober only a few weeks were set to work on brand-new cases. This was a new departure, and the results were fantastic. A few months later, Clevelands membership had expanded to 500. For the first time, it was shown that sobriety could be mass-produced. Meanwhile, in New York, Dr. Bob and Bill had in 1938 organized an over-all trusteeship for the budding Fellowship. Friends of John D. Rockefeller Jr. became board members alongside a contingent of AAs. This board was named The Alcoholic Foundation. However, all efforts to raise large amounts of money failed, because Mr. Rockefeller had wisely concluded that great sums might spoil the infant society. Nevertheless, the foundation managed to open a tiny office in New York to handle inquiries and to distribute the Alcoholics Anonymous. book - an enterprise which, by the way, had been mostly financed by the AAs themselves. The book and the new office were quickly put to use. An article about AA was carried by Liberty magazine in the fall of 1939, resulting in some 800 urgent calls for help. In 1940, Mr. Rockefeller gave a dinner for many of his prominent New York friends to publicize AA This brought yet another flood of pleas. Each inquiry received a personal letter and a small pamphlet. Attention was also drawn to the book Alcoholics Anonymous, which soon moved into brisk circulation. Aided by mail from New York, and by AA travellers from already-established centres, many new groups came alive. At the years end, the membership stood at 2,000. Then, in March 1941, the Saturday Evening Post featured an excellent article about AA, and the response was enormous. By the close of that year, the membership had jumped to 6,000, and the number of groups multiplied in proportion. Spreading across the U.S. and Canada, the Fellowship mushroomed. By 1950, 100,000 recovered alcoholics could be found worldwide. Spectacular though this was, the period 1940-1950 was nonetheless one of great uncertainty. The crucial question was whether all those mercurial alcoholics could live and work together in groups. Could they hold together and function effectively? This was the unsolved problem. Corresponding with thousands of groups about their problems became a chief occupation of the New York headquarters. By 1946, however, it had already become possible to draw sound conclusions about the kinds of attitude, practice and function that would best suit AAs purpose. Those principles, which had emerged from strenuous group experience, were codified by Bill in what are today the Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous. By 1950, the earlier chaos had largely disappeared. A successful formula for AA unity and functioning had been achieved and put into practice. (See The Structure of AA General Service in U.S./Canada.) During this hectic ten-year period, Dr. Bob devoted himself to the question of hospital care for alcoholics, and to their indoctrination with AA principles. Large numbers of alcoholics flocked to Akron to receive hospital care at St. Thomas, a Catholic hospital. Dr. Bob became a member of its staff. Subsequently, he and the remarkable Sister M. Ignatia, also of the staff, cared for and brought AA to some 5,000 sufferers. After Dr. Bobs death in 1950, Sister Ignatia continued to work at Clevelands Charity Hospital, where she was assisted by the local groups and where 10,000 more sufferers first found AA. This set a fine example of hospitalization wherein AA could cooperate with both medicine and religion. In this same year of 1950, AA held its first International Convention at Cleveland. There, Dr. Bob made his last appearance and keyed his final talk to the need of keeping AA simple. Together with all present, he saw the Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous enthusiastically adopted for the permanent use of the AA Fellowship throughout the world. (He died on November 16, 1950.) The following year witnessed still another significant event. The New York office had greatly expanded its activities, and these now consisted of public relations, advice to new groups, services to hospitals, prisons, Loners, and Internationalists, and cooperation with other agencies in the alcoholism field. The headquarters was also publishing ""standard"" AA books and pamphlets, and it supervised their translation into other tongues. Our international magazine, the AA Grapevine, had achieved a large circulation. These and many other activities had become indispensable for AA as a whole. Nevertheless, these vital services were still in the hands of an isolated board of trustees, whose only link to the Fellowship had been Bill and Dr. Bob. As the co-founders had foreseen years earlier, it became absolutely necessary to link AAs world trusteeship (now the General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous) with the Fellowship that it served. Delegates from all states and provinces of the U.S. and Canada were forthwith called in. Thus composed, this body for world service first met in 1951. Despite earlier misgivings, the gathering was a great success. For the first time, the remote trusteeship became directly accountable to AA as a whole. The AA General Service Conference had been created, and AAs over-all functioning was thereby assured for the future. A second International Convention was held in St. Louis in 1955 to celebrate the Fellowships 20th anniversary. The General Service Conference had by then completely proved its worth. Here, on behalf of AAs old-timers, Bill turned the future care and custody of AA over to the Conference and its trustees. At this moment, the Fellowship went on its own; AA had come of age. Had it not been for AAs early friends, Alcoholics Anonymous might never have come into being. And without its host of well-wishers who have since given of their time and effort - particularly those friends of medicine, religion, and world communications - AA could never have grown and prospered. The Fellowship here records its constant gratitude. It was on January 24, 1971, that Bill, a victim of pneumonia, died in Miami Beach, Florida, where - seven months earlier - he had delivered at the 35th Anniversary International Convention what proved to be his last words to fellow AAs: ""God bless you and Alcoholics Anonymous forever."" Since then, AA has become truly global, and this has revealed that AAs way of life can today transcend most barriers of race, creed and language. A World Service Meeting, started in 1969, has been held biennially since 1972. Its locations alternate between New York and overseas. It has met in London, England; Helsinki, Finland; San Juan del Rio, Mexico; Guatemala City, Guatemala; Munich, Germany and Cartagena, Colombia. The Start of AA in Great Britain The venue for AAs first meeting in Great Britain was pretty classy - Londons Dorchester Hotel. Grace O, an American AA, visiting London had been asked by GSO in New York to contact several people in Britain who wanted information about AA. Amongst them were Chris B, probably the first person in England to use AA to attain sobriety, Canadian Bob B, an American serviceman Sergeant Vernon W, and Norman R-W, who was still drinking. The meeting was held in Room 202 of the hotel at 8 p.m. on Monday 31st March 1947. Others attending the meeting were Tony F, an Irish airman, Flash W, an American and Pat G, a female member from California whom Grace had met on the voyage. In the same way that early American meetings had been held in members homes meetings were held in Canadian Bobs house in Mortlake Road, Kew Gardens as well as in cafés. Progress was slow at first but when Canadian Bob visited new members Alan and wife Winnie in Bolton he informed them that they were the Bolton Group. In November 1948 the Group held its first meeting in the Millgate Hotel, Manchester. When Canadian Bob introduced Bill H to sobriety in AA our service structure expanded with Bills office in the London Fruit Exchange providing the fellowship with a postal address (BM/AAL London WC1) and a contact number (Bishopgate 9657) available Monday to Friday. By January 1949 meetings in London were being held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11 Chandos Street and membership had passed the magic 100. In 1952 AA began to lease 11 Redcliffe Gardens with the Central Committee managing it as the Central Service Office. In 1970 it became the General Service Office under the management of the General Service Board. When GSO relocated to Stonebow House in York in 1986 the London Regional Telephone office remained at Redcliffe Gardens until January 1999 when it moved into the Regional Service Office (London) at Jacob House and Redcliffe Gardens passed out of AA history. Meanwhile in Scotland the Oxford Groups had an instrumental role in AA beginnings as they had in America. The wife of Philip D, an active alcoholic, attended an Oxford Group in Scotland and heard about the Groups role in the start of AA. Philip visited America in 1948 and attended meetings before returning to Scotland and carrying the message. Forbes C got involved and meetings began in Perth, Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1949. Cathedral Road, Cardiff was the location of the first AA meeting in Wales. The meeting took place on Friday 13th April 1951 with five attendees.

What happens in an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?,"Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the group's meetings?",,10 June 2010,BBC News,"Image caption The true nature of alcoholism is a controversial subject Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are marking its 75th anniversary, but what really goes on inside the groups meetings? David looks, in a word, respectable. Bespectacled, and in a polo shirt and khaki shorts, he could be any respectable middle-aged man. He sits in a circle of other respectable-looking people in a church hall in a well-to-do part of Washington. Without knowing the context, as he prepares to speak, one might guess that this was a heritage group, ready to save a historic warehouse, or a meeting of concerned residents, demanding traffic-calming measures. Instead, when David opens his mouth, he starts to talk about his first use of drugs at the age of 12. Later he talks about his conscious decision to drink himself to death. Easy eloquence There is the revelation of small-time drug smuggling trips to South America and a life of profound lows. But he has an easy eloquence. ""I have fond memories of the moronic quality of being drunk,"" he says. People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad - in AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless Jack Trimpey , Rational Recovery ""My story is getting far away mentally. It is almost like the Peloponnesian War now."" The others in the group also speak enthusiastically, talking of trials and tribulations, of their relationship to drink and how they came to be part of AA. One gum-chewing, room-dominating woman contrasts life as a high-powered sober Washingtonian with her previous pre-AA life in a series of expansive arm gestures. Another man quietly and movingly recounts his sons troubles with the law. Its impossible to say whether these individuals were always raconteurs or whether their storytelling matured as they took the 12 Steps. Higher power Certain lines provoke laughter in the group. ""The only thing I knew for sure about my problem was it wasnt a drinking problem,"" deadpans one man. ""I knew you had to drink too much to have a drinking problem and I could never drink enough."" Image caption The AA dates its foundation to its co-founders last drink There are other phrases that are reverentially repeated. Life became ""unmanageable"" and a ""higher power"" has been at work. A 70-year-old salesman talks about a life where money was made in computers but years were lost to vodka. A woman talks of her travels and a reassuring fact. ""There are rooms like this all over the world where crazy people get to talk."" Of the 11 men and three women in the room, eight have been sober for more than 20 years. And their meeting is in a long tradition that stretches back to 10 June 1935, to the day Robert Smith - better known as Dr Bob - had his last drink. He had been working with AA co-founder Bill Wilson, now usually referred to as Bill W. Fictional depictions The organisation they created has helped millions give up drinking and rebuild their lives. And the meetings, with the 12-Step Programme that is at the heart of AA, are familiar even to those who have had nothing to do with the group. The higher power is not just the god of your understanding it is the people in the room Stan, Recovering alcoholic Countless depictions on film and television have familiarised people with what goes on at the meetings and the familiar formulation ""Im X and Im an alcoholic"". The organisation has its critics. There are those who disagree with the founding idea that alcoholism is a disease, a compulsion that the individual can do nothing about. Others dislike the Christian nature of the group. The 12 Steps talk of God ""as you understood him"". Jack Trimpey, who runs his own programme Rational Recovery, is a trenchant critic. ""We do object that it is a bad religion, one in which people profess powerlessness against their bodily desires. We are not powerless. We have a moral duty to cease and desist once it is shown. ""It has been a massive inversion of public thinking that has entered the mainstream media. ""People do feel shame and guilt when they do things that are bad. In AA you learn to be shameless and guiltless."" He prefers to call himself a former ""bad drunk"" and speaks of an alternative approach that calls for ""zero tolerance in the family"". Having been sober for many year, he dislikes the typical AA attitude towards that. ""Its not an accomplishment - common decency is no accomplishment."" Image caption Concerns about binge drinking are now common to much of the world But for the people at the AA meetings, common decency - and everything else good in life - is an accomplishment. Jonathan speaks of the single day in 1987 when he first had a moment of happiness. And he knows how it must be maintained. ""I pray and I meditate, and I couple that with working with other alcoholics."" People at the group seem to have no problem with the varied application of the religious element of AA. There are atheist and agnostic groups, but its hard to get away from the references to God in the 12 Steps that are at the heart of AA. The softly-spoken Stan explains: ""The higher power is not just the god of your understanding, it is the people in the room."" And those other people are the key, one woman admits. ""It works because everything I attempted to do about drinking by myself never worked. ""By coming into AA I was able to get support to not drink - people who think exactly like me, that common bond.""

Every university 'needs' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings,Alcoholics Anonymous says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase.,,31 July 2018,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings should take place in universities across the UK, student leaders have said. Charity AA says the number of younger people attending their meetings is on the increase. NUS Wales president Gwyneth Sweatman said Cardiff Universitys sessions for problem drinkers, one of the first of its kind, have made a big difference. One student said the help she received turned her life around. Cardiff undergraduate ""Marie"" said alcohol pushed her life at university to the edge. At her lowest ebb, she drank 15 pints of cider a day, was arrested and risked being kicked off her course. She said: ""It was affecting my work significantly. ""I wasnt concentrating in meetings, I couldnt focus, I was erratic in my behaviour and my decisions."" ""I wasnt turning up, it was having a really negative effect on my mental health and that was spiralling, really awful anxiety and depression and suicide-based thoughts."" The latest official data suggest young people are drinking less. However, Dr Mani Mehdikhani, a trustee at Alcoholics Anonymous, said the number of younger attendees at meetings was on the up. ""Looking at our own internal AA surveys that we conduct every five years, every time a survey is undertaken we have increasingly larger numbers of younger people coming as new-comers to AA. ""The last survey in 2015, about 33% of our newcomers were under 40 and Im sure a big percentage were in the university student-age group.""

Cardiff University also has a student counselling and a well-being team which provides support for ""some of the underlying difficulties associated with, or directly linked to, alcohol misuse"".

Should there be a word for an 'almost alcoholic'?,"Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism?",,8 January 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright Thinkstock Everybody thinks they know what an ""alcoholic"" is, but what about those who drink too much but fall short of the common definitions of alcoholism? Should there be a word that bridges the gap between alcoholic and non-alcoholic? The term alcoholic - on its own to denote someone addicted to alcohol - was first used in 1852 in the Scottish Temperance Review. Since then, millions of heavy drinkers have been confronted by friends and families with the stark question: ""Are you an alcoholic?"" And millions have denied it. Rejected the label. Confessed only to maybe, possibly drinking too much. But utterly denied the A-word. Alcoholics are people who fall asleep in skips. Alcoholics get into fights. Alcoholics start the day with a shot of whisky. Alcoholics are drunk all the time. Alcoholics cant hold down jobs. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Scottish clergyman Rev Thomas Guthrie (centre), an advocate of temperance None of the above is necessarily true, but the intensely negative nature of the word alcoholic leaves some people scrabbling for an alternative. ""There is so much stigma,"" says Kate, author of the blog The Sober Journalist. People are so frightened of it - their head fills with images of men drinking under bridges. ""There is this huge number of people out there who dont fit that stereotype but perhaps their drinking isnt quite normal."" Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences You look forward to drinking. You drink alone. You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms. You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking Kate went to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when she started to think she was drinking too much, about four or five years ago. ""I felt I was out of place, I wasnt alcoholic enough. I felt that everyone else had worse problems with drinking than I did,"" she says. There are other words for people who drink a lot. There is everything from the lightly derogatory ""lush"" to the more flowery ""bibulous"" to the prosaic ""heavy drinker"". But there is nothing as succinct as alcoholic. And some believe that this gap has an effect. Professionals have started using other terms that would not be as negative as alcoholic because ""many doctors feel that it is quite difficult to engage a patient if you talk to them about alcoholism"", says Dr Sarah Jarvis, a consultant for Patient.co.uk. People have such vivid mental images of what it means to be an alcoholic that they measure themselves against that standard and do not seek help. ""They all have an idea of what an alcohol or problem drinker is but there is a different pattern for every drinker,"" Jarvis says. Not all experts share this view, however. Theres a danger that avoiding the term ""alcoholism"" will only serve ""to reassure people their drinking is OK when it isnt"", says Moira Plant, emeritus professor of alcohol studies at the University of the West of England. Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption The term inebriate was popular in the 19th Century She agrees the widespread impression of the alcoholic as a vagrant or street-drinker prevents higher-functioning people with drink problems from seeking help. But she says the best way to tackle this is to correct false stereotypes, not downplay the situation faced by such individuals - many of whom are already in denial. ""People normalise heavy drinking,"" she says. ""They tend to overestimate what everyone else drinks. They say, I dont drink as much as my friends so its OK."" There have been other words to describe someone drinking too much. In the 19th Century ""inebriate"" was a popular term and the word ""drunkard"" goes all the way back to the 15th Century. Englands Department of Health recommends that men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day and women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day. But drinking above these recommendations does not necessarily mean that the person is an alcoholic. It just means increased risk of health damage. ""An alcoholic is anyone who is dependent on alcohol and who is drinking to a level that will endanger their health,"" Dr Jarvis says. The term alcoholic is very much alive in the vocabulary of ordinary people, says Tim Leighton, director of professional education and research at Action on Addiction. ""In Europe and in the UK, there was a move away from the term in the 1960s; it was seen as derogatory. We now talk about alcohol dependence, but you dont hear people in the street saying he is an alcohol dependent, they say he is an alcoholic,"" he says. Dr Jarvis says it is a shame the words ""hazardous"" or ""harmful"" drinker arent used more widely. The issue with the use of the word ""alcoholic"" is that it is narrow. ""You are either one or you are not,"" Leighton says. ""This is why some people prefer the term alcohol dependence. You can be an alcoholic without drinking too much - it is all about dependence, about losing control."" For a long time, it was a strict category, there were specific criteria and if you fulfilled these criteria, you were an alcoholic, says Joseph Nowinski, one of the authors of the book Almost Alcoholic. This is a stage for a lot of controversy - as long as you didnt meet the alcoholic criteria, you would say, ""I am not an alcoholic so I dont have a drinking problem"", he says. ""There has never been a word for people who come to the point of asking themselves the question, Do I have a problem or not?"" Based on this, Nowinski and Robert Doyle came up with the concept of being an ""almost alcoholic"" to describe people who are not alcoholics but who ""fall into a grey area of problem drinking"". ""The almost alcoholic zone is actually quite large. The people who occupy it are not alcoholics. Rather, they are men and women whose drinking habits range from barely qualifying as almost alcoholics to those whose drinking borders on abuse,"" they wrote in the Atlantic. ""An expanded view of drinking behaviour in terms of a spectrum as opposed to discrete categories might be viewed by some as opening the door to over-diagnosing the associated problems. We believe the opposite will prove to be the case: that this paradigm shift will allow people to recognise problems earlier and to seek solutions without having to be labelled as alcoholics."" ""There is a huge range of alcohol problems,"" Leighton says. ""A lot of people with alcohol problems are not alcoholics."" Until a new label is popularised there will be people who struggle to admit they have a problem, he says. But for Kate, the existing term has come to make sense as her recovery has progressed. ""I feel that eight months ago I wouldnt have said that I was an alcoholic and now I could say I am because I know what it means,"" she says.

And UK Punjabi services the First Step Foundation and the Shanti Project have also seen an increase in interest. Sohan Sahota, of Bac-In said: ""Average website hits are around 2,000 a month.

"Could you be a workaholic, addicted to your job?","Most of us like to be a diligent worker, but what if you are actually addicted to your job?",,4 April 2018,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could working too hard and for too many hours be a form of addiction? ""My name is JC and I am a workaholic."" JC, who lives in Tampa Bay, Florida, says she needed a lot of courage the first time she stood up and said that in front of a group of people she had never met before. JC, who doesnt want us to reveal her full name, had gone along to a meeting of Workaholics Anonymous because she felt she couldnt cope anymore. A 40-year-old healthcare worker, who had conquered her alcoholism and an eating disorder, she says she couldnt experience the serenity that she hoped sobriety would bring because she instead had become addicted to working. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption For many people securing a decent work/life balance is a tricky business ""I was constantly obsessed with work,"" she says. ""I realised I used work to numb out and avoid myself, my feelings and my fears."" Her work addiction and the stress that came with it affected her health. ""I had premature grey hair within three months of starting a management position,"" she says. ""I experienced adrenal fatigue... I have a heart condition."" Following a similar 12-step recovery plan to the one first devised by Alcoholics Anonymous, Workaholics Anonymous started in the US in the early 1980s. Today there are more than 100 meeting groups around the world, from Argentina to the US, the UK and Japan. There is also the possibility of joining an online meeting via Skype or over the phone. But how do you know if you are a workaholic? And what other ways are there to get help? Wilmar Schaufeli, a professor of work and organisational psychology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, describes a workaholic as ""a person who works obsessively hard in a compulsive way"". Image copyright Jord Visser Image caption Wilmar Schaufeli says that Workaholics Anonymous works for many suffers, because they can realise they are not alone ""So its a combination between excessive work and compulsive work, compulsive tendency."" He adds that going to Workaholics Anonymous works for many sufferers because ""you see people who have the same problem, so you are not alone. I think this is an important thing for all kinds of behavioural problems or addictions."" For other people with work addiction problems, having one-to-one therapy with a trained professional might be the answer. But what actually can lead to work addition? Dr Claudia Herbert, a clinical psychologist at the Oxford Development Centre, in Putney, Oxfordshire, often treats sufferers. She says that many workaholics have other mental health disorders. ""Lots of clients may feel depressed, they may actually think that life is a little bit empty, they may have anxiety problems, they may also have addictions to cope with."" Image copyright Claudia Herbert Image caption Claudia Herbert says that many workaholics have other mental health problems The condition can be triggered by someone having to work too hard in the first place. ""People often have to take jobs that in previous times would have been done by two or three people,"" she says. Work addiction may be caused in part by a person being pushed too hard by his or her parents in their earlier life. ""People who as children were reinforced by their achievements rather than who they are, they are more likely to become work addicted,"" she adds. When it comes to the types of jobs where people are more vulnerable to becoming workaholics, Prof Schaufeli says it is more a case of senior professionals rather than those with jobs on the lower rungs of the workplace ladder. He says that self-employed people are also vulnerable because they can become obsessed by their businesses. Prof Schaufeli adds that work addicts very often dont see that their behaviour is problematic because the fact they are doing vast amounts of work often means they are earning more and being promoted. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some workaholics are not said to recognise that anything is wrong because they have secured promotions and pay rises When it comes to treating work addiction, Dr Herbert says it needs to be individually tailored to each sufferer, and getting to the bottom of what caused it. At Retreat South, a rehabilitation centre and mental health retreat in the Australian state of Victoria, they run a work-related stress and executive burnout programme, trying to get peoples work/life balance back.

How to tell if you’re a workaholic,There’s a difference between pulling long hours and having an out-of-control urge to work. But where’s the line? Alison Birrane reports,Alison Birrane,2016-10-17 00:00:00,,"Everyone loves a hard worker. In fact, pulling long hours on the job and earning big is considered by many to be the modern mark of success. Being labelled a workaholic is, as often as not, seen as a badge of honour. But for some, the obsessive need to work comes at the expense of everything else. Health, relationships and even work quality can suffer. Its a high price to pay. Workaholics are less productive than colleagues with a healthier attitude and approach to work Whatever the case, a compulsion to work has been leading people to therapists and self-help groups for years. It can even be deadly. Earlier this month, a Japanese government study found one fifth of the Japanese workforce is at risk of death from overwork. Overwork isn’t just a problem in Japan. Workaholics Anonymous, a 12-step programme which models itself on Alcoholics Anonymous, held its first international conference in the UK in June, with attendees hailing from across the globe. There has been little research into why workaholism develops. But that’s changing – in recent years, the phenomenon has begun to get more attention and is being treated as more than just a buzzword. Workaholism is not recognised as a medical condition by the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is considered the gold standard in diagnosing mental disorders. Another large-scale study linked workaholic tendencies to other psychiatric issues, like obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression But even without a precise definition, its impact is being linked to health, workplace and mental issues, and researchers are taking note. A recent meta-analysis – a quantitative summary of the existing research into workaholism – by the University of Georgia showed, among other things, that workaholics are less productive than colleagues with a healthier attitude and approach to work. Another large-scale study, published in May by the University of Bergen in Norway, linked workaholic tendencies to other psychiatric issues, like obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression. Not your best work But when does hard work turn negative? What might lead someone to believe they are a work addict? Well, workaholism is a compulsion – an obsessive and out-of-control urge to work, or think about it, says Bryan Robinson, a psychotherapist based in North Carolina who conducted early research into the effects of work addiction and wrote Chained to the Desk, a guidebook for workaholics. ""Workaholism is not defined by hours. Its defined by whats going on inside of us,” he says. “A workaholic is someone whos on the ski slopes dreaming about being back at work. A healthy worker is at work, dreaming about being on the ski slopes.” Robinson, who has counselled people who have divorced, been fired or driven to health crises as a result of chronic overwork, recalls one client who would tell her husband she was at the gym, but instead would go to work before changing into workout clothes and dousing herself in water to make it look like shed been sweating. Sound like someone you know? But workaholics are not necessarily producing the best work or are any more engaged at the office than their colleagues, the University of Georgia meta-analysis found. Malissa A Clark, an assistant professor of industrial and organisational psychology at the University of Georgia, led the study. She says workaholics reported greater job stress, lower job satisfaction, lower life satisfaction and more burnout. Warning signs The Bergen Work Addiction Scale uses seven basic criteria to identify work addiction, scored as follows: (1) Never, (2) Rarely, (3) Sometimes, (4) Often, and (5) Always. If you score “often” or “always” on at least four of the seven criteria, you may be a workaholic. You think of how you can free up more time to work. You spend much more time working than initially intended. You work in order to reduce feelings of guilt, anxiety, helplessness and depression. You have been told by others to cut down on work without listening to them. You become stressed if you are prohibited from working. You deprioritise hobbies, leisure activities, and exercise because of your work. You work so much that it has negatively influenced your health They also reported greater work-life conflict, lower physical and mental health and detrimental outcomes for family, such as marital problems. “Theres not a lot of positive outcomes,” she adds, despite the concept of workaholism often being linked with traits like being driven, competitive, ambitious and productive. Help in high water Think you might have a problem? There are a couple of self-assessments you can take. Norwegian researchers have created the Bergen Work Addiction Scale, where you can gauge your behavior, feelings and attitude towards work. Workaholics Anonymous also has an online questionnaire that can help you determine if you might need to seek help. The first step, experts say, is to admit you have a problem. For Robinson, who calls himself a recovering workaholic, treatment involves mindfulness, therapy, behavioural changes and uncovering the underlying issues. “There are root causes to it. Sometimes its self-esteem, sometimes its a way to modulate anxiety,” he says. The drug for workaholics is adrenaline For Bob, 61, of California, admitting he had a problem came when his wife told him shed had enough of waking up the middle of the night and discovering him absent, still at the office. Bob – who preferred to use only his first name to preserve the anonymity of the Workaholics Anonymous programme – is now an outreach officer for Workaholics Anonymous, a volunteer position. “The drug for workaholics is adrenaline,” he says. “Stress, pressure, crisis, deadlines, those all allow the ability get adrenalised and the ability to operate at a frantic pace.” Bob had his first jobs at five years old – helping his brother deliver newspapers, recycling cans and bottles, mowing lawns and shovelling snow. He became a successful businessman, but ultimately his health suffered, and if hed not sought help, his family-life would have too, he said. His wife had had enough. “Her no longer being willing to live like that is what gave me the willingness to finally pursue this programme with some commitment and conviction,” Bob says. Work, like food, is not something you can just give up cold turkey But work, like food, is not something you can just give up cold turkey. So how can you control your impulse to work incessantly? “Its having a plan and following a plan, versus, compulsively diving in to whatever pops up,” says Bob. That means scheduling work hours, focusing on one thing at time, and if something unexpected arises, rather than chaotically trying to cram everything in and multi-tasking, going back to your list and reprioritising. Other treatment options include finding a therapist who is versed in this area. Or, you can attend outpatient workshops and programmes. And, now inpatient residential programmes, such as that offered by The Bridge To Recovery, located in Ohio in the US, are offering help for workaholics alongside other treatments for obsessive or compulsive behaviours, anxiety and depression. But a big factor in the lack of available treatment, says Clark, is lack of research. “Theres not a lot of research on how it develops and theres almost no research on the relationship between workaholism and clinical disorders.” The Norwegian study is one of the first. More research is needed, she says, “so it becomes more mainstream rather than this fringe topic buzzword that people throw out there. It does have legitimate detrimental outcomes to peoples lives and peoples well-being.” To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",{},"['workaholic', 'youre', 'research', 'workaholism', 'anonymous', 'work', 'obsessive', 'study', 'anxiety', 'workaholics', 'health', 'tell']","Workaholics Anonymous, a 12-step programme which models itself on Alcoholics Anonymous, held its first international conference in the UK in June, with attendees hailing from across the globe.

The unspoken alcohol problem among UK Punjabis,Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need.,,4 April 2018,BBC News,"Image copyright Vik Kainth For many British Punjabis, alcohol abuse is an open secret. Alcohol consumption is glamorised across different aspects of Punjabi culture and shame stops many seeking the help that they need. Harjinder read her daughter Jaspreet one last bedtime story, then kissed her goodnight. She was exhausted after a long day, and drifted off next to her daughter. Her toddler son was already asleep in the next room. The next thing she remembers is her husband yelling. He was drunk and furious that when he returned from the pub she wasnt in their marital bed. In a rage, he flipped the childs bed throwing his wife and daughter to the floor. Harjinder hit the radiator hard with Jaspreet landing on top of her. Incidents like this were a regular feature of Jaspreet and her brother Hardeeps childhood. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Jaspreet says. So when Harjinder found Hardeep, now aged 16, drinking whisky in his room after an argument with his alcoholic dad, she was terrified that he was following in his fathers footsteps. There are around 430,000 Sikhs in the UK, making up a significant proportion of the British Punjabi population. Harjinder herself is Sikh and amongst her community her experience isnt unique. A new survey, commissioned by the BBC to investigate attitudes to alcohol among British Sikhs, found that - although drinking alcohol is forbidden in Sikhism - 27% of British Sikhs report having someone in their family with an alcohol problem. Its a problem which is rarely talked about openly in the community. More than 1,000 British Sikhs responded to the survey - find out more using this interactive tool: Catch me up hide Harjinder moved in with her husbands family after their arranged marriage - both common practices within Punjabi and wider South Asian communities. She was shocked to find out how much her newly acquired familys social life centred around the mens excessive drinking. The family, along with young children, would go to a friends house and would stay there until two or three oclock in the morning waiting for the men, and she started to feel increasingly isolated. Rav Sekhon, a British Punjabi psychotherapist who works with ethnic minority communities, says: ""There is really strong pride and honour for the family name. They dont want anyone to perceive them as having something wrong with them or any form of weakness."" You might also like: Sanjay Bhandari is from a Hindu Punjabi family, a partner at a multinational city firm in London and a recovering alcoholic. After his father died when he was 15, he says he started drinking and never really stopped. By his mid 30s, he realised that he hadnt been a single day without a drink for over seven years, and hed been dependent on alcohol for much longer. He says his Punjabi background played a big part in discouraging him from admitting he had a problem. Sanjay, who has been sober for 16 years, says he didnt feel that he could admit he had a weakness, nor that he was feeling lonely and self-medicating with alcohol. He didnt look to the Punjabi community for help, but eventually found Alcoholics Anonymous. ""It would never have occurred to me to go to the community for help with drinking. It was almost the last place I would have gone."" Image copyright Vik Kainth When the first immigrants, who were mostly men, came to the UK from Punjab in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, many found themselves struggling to assimilate being in a new country, often working long hours to send money home to their families. The stresses of moving to a new culture, the associated language barriers and the racism they faced meant many of these men turned to alcohol to cope. This reliance on alcohol has had generational repercussions. Jennifer Shergill, an alcohol practitioner from the West Midlands, works with Sikh men and women to manage and overcome addiction. She points to the combination of British binge drinking and the culture of drinking in Punjab, which together create a perfect storm for some of the people accessing support services. For Harjinder, her husbands heavy drinking had worsening consequences. Although he was becoming increasingly violent towards her, she was still reluctant to seek help. She says his behaviour was normalised by his family, leaving her feeling almost brainwashed by them into hopelessly accepting the situation. It wasnt until she went to her GP with injuries from the abuse that she realised that what she was experiencing wasnt normal. Eventually Harjinder called the police and she and her children moved out of the family home to stay with her parents. Even then her husband didnt acknowledge the impact that his drinking was having. ""I think [my husband] knew deep down that what he was doing was wrong but it was almost as if his male pride couldnt admit it."" Image copyright Vik Kainth Jennifer Shergill thinks one of the barriers for people seeking help is the fear of someone finding out. ""There is stigma associated with chronic alcohol misuse and they dont want their reputation to be tainted... if there is a dependent drinker in the family what might people think of our family?"" The Shanti Project, where Jennifer works, is just one scheme working to tackle this stigma and to provide culturally appropriate services for the Punjabi community in Birmingham. Others include a volunteer-led Sikh Helpline, the Derby Recovery Network, BAC-IN, and First Step Foundation, which are all doing their part to help tackle alcoholism in a culturally sensitive way. The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute Harjinders husband due to a lack of evidence and, six weeks later, Harjinder and her children returned to the home she shared with her husband. Her husbands family had visited her to assure her he had stopped drinking and things would be different - so feeling the pressure from both his family and her own, she and her children returned home. But Harjinder struggled with depression. Her husband hadnt stopped drinking. It was at this point that - prompted by a community psychiatric nurse - she started talking to a counsellor. ""I felt quite desperate at times,"" she says, ""but the counselling really helped, I felt that I could carry on."" Harjinder is still living with her husband after more than 20 years of marriage, but their lives are very separate now. Her daughter, now in her 20s, constantly urges her to leave him. ""Ive thought about it a lot. A part of me thinks, why bother at this age? But then another part of me thinks: well, if Ive got another 20 years of this, thats not good. I think it could happen.""

"'So drunk my daughter, 12, made my meals'","As more women are treated for drink problems, one mother tells how her evening glass of wine turned into full-blown alcoholism.",,17 November 2016,BBC News,"Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Womens alcohol consumption is catching up with men ""My daughter told me she didnt like the fact that I always smelt of wine. That was probably the point I thought I may have a problem."" What started as a few glasses of wine in the evening with her husband quickly developed into full-blown alcoholism for Alice, a mother of one from Birmingham. Shes one of a growing number of women dealing with a drink problem, with recent statistics showing women are nearing equality with men in alcohol consumption. But as the shame of her addiction eventually forced her to seek help, she found several barriers in her way as a woman and mother seeking treatment. Her problems with alcohol started at the age of 33 when she married and had a child. ""My then husband used to like popping to the local for one or two drinks before bed. Once our child was born this led onto opening a bottle of wine each evening and this is when the pattern started. ""Over the years it went from sharing one bottle to sharing two-plus. Then it moved to having a drink as soon as I got home from work about 4pm."" Need help or support? Need help or support? Her marriage eventually broke down, and Alice sought more comfort from the bottle. Alcohol was no longer a treat in the home, but became part of her daily routine, regularly drinking alone. She didnt see as dangerous at the time. ""We hear horror stories of binge drinking but not about the middle class consumption of wine or a gin and tonic in the evening. ""When I grew up men went out to the pub and drank, women less so because alcohol was not generally available in the home except for special occasions. Things have equalised."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alice said Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were too male dominated Alice was signed off work with depression whilst dealing with her divorce, and after a day of drinking would often be inebriated by the time her daughter came home from school. Her daughter often had to do the household chores she was unable to complete. ""She made tea on a number of occasions,"" recalls Alice. ""I had taken an overdose on a couple of occasions - never serious attempts just feeling drunk and wretched. My daughter was about 12 at the time and she was becoming increasingly fearful about how much I was drinking."" This, combined with GP blood tests, made her realise how much damage she was doing to herself and those around her. Alice initially tried to seek help at AA meetings, but struggled with their male dominated environment and could never find childcare for her daughter. ""There needs to be women only groups and support groups to help with childcare so they can attend appointments and meetings."" ""I think that women, especially single women, have more of an issue because they fear social service involvement and losing their children"".

I have now had a whole raft of excellent experiences."" Knowing the risks Defeating alcoholism also made Alice find some compromises in her life, which involved stepping back from career aspirations to focus on her family. ""I dont need to overdo it by working full-time. I spend more, and less stressful, time with the kids."" The theme of Alcohol Awareness Week 2016, which ends on 20 November, is ""knowing the risks"" - getting people thinking about why they drink, and ""how it affects us as individuals, families, communities and society as a whole."" Sian Warmer, head of services at CGL, the charity that helped Alice, says they help people identify why they are turning to drink.

Smashed: Mary Elizabeth Winstead on playing an alcoholic,An independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News speaks to its director and stars.,,14 December 2012,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead tells the BBC why she took on her most dramatic role to date A low-budget independent film about an elementary schoolteacher with a drinking problem has been tipped as a potential awards contender. BBC News spoke to its director and stars. Movie awards voters tend to be impressed by hard-hitting studies of alcoholism, regularly rewarding films that have highlighted the perils of the demon drink. Ray Milland won an Oscar in 1946 for playing a drunkard in The Lost Weekend, as did Nicolas Cage, 50 years later, for imbibing himself to death in Leaving Las Vegas. Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne and Jeff Bridges were also given Hollywoods highest accolade for playing characters partial to a tipple. It can work for actresses too. Elizabeth Taylor received her second Oscar for playing a boozy harridan in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, while Lee Remick got a nomination for going blotto in Days of Wine and Roses. All of which bodes well for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose portrayal of Kate, a young wife trying to stay off the sauce in the independent film Smashed, is being tipped as a dark horse in this years awards race. Only last month, she was nominated for a Spirit award, alongside Jennifer Lawrence (from Silver Linings Playbook) and child performer Quvenzhane Wallis (from Beasts of the Southern Wild). Could an Oscar nomination follow in January? During a visit to London last month, the 28-year-old was studiously playing down her chances. Wonderful imagination ""Im very aware my chances are not very high so Im not getting my hopes up,"" says the actress, previously seen in quirky movies like Scott Pilgrim vs The World and Quentin Tarantinos Death Proof. ""But its lovely to hear anyone say anything like that about a performance Ive done, and I certainly cant help but fantasise about the idea of being a part of it in some way."" ""I had seen Mary in big action films like Die Hard 4.0 and the remake of The Thing,"" says Smashed director James Ponsoldt, whose work won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival last January. Image caption Paul (left) is known to US TV audiences for playing Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad ""But spending time with her, I realised what a wonderful imagination she has and how willing she was to really prepare for this role."" Those sentiments are shared by actor Aaron Paul, who took a break from playing a crystal meth dealer in TVs Breaking Bad to appear as Charlie, Kates free-spirited, perennially intoxicated husband. ""The goal in this business is to get lost in the scenes and truly feel like youre living moments as if they were your own,"" says the 33-year-old. ""That happened pretty much every day on set with Mary. It was great and a wonderful experience."" Should accolades come in Smasheds direction, it would be quite a coup for a film shot in just 19 days for a reported $500,000 (£312,557). Not only that, but it would also surely be the first movie so honoured to feature a teacher publicly relieving herself on a convenience store floor. For Winstead, used to projecting glamorous self-assurance on red carpets and in photo shoots, fabricating something so indecorous and unladylike must have posed a challenge. Apparently, though, such considerations were secondary compared to the need to make an artificial bladder function on cue. Not propaganda ""Whats funny in scenes like that is that sometimes the technical aspects end up overriding everything else,"" the actress smiles. ""I was wearing this... device, and when I sat down I had to put my arm on my leg to activate it. ""And it wasnt working - every take it wasnt working. On every take everyone was behind the camera going, Is it going to work? ""So it really got rid of all of the humiliation of doing that scene, because all the focus was on hoping that it worked and that we could actually get the scene done."" Winsteads character is driven to seek help from Alcoholics Anonymous, much to the chagrin of her hard-drinking husband. Image caption The cast of Smashed includes Octavia Spencer (right), who won an Oscar this year for The Help The film takes a fairly uncritical view of the organisation, which is depicted by Ponsoldt and his co-writer Susan Burke as a benignly tolerant force for social good. ""Susan and I have very complicated feelings towards AA,"" says the director. ""We both know people whose lives have been saved by it, and we know people who left because they thought it was a cult. ""We didnt want to glorify it; this is certainly not a propaganda film. Nor did we want to take easy shots at it. ""We just wanted the scenes at AA to feel honest and true, so we went to great lengths to make sure they were accurate."" As graphic as Smashed becomes, particularly when Paul and Winsteads characters are at their most inebriated, it is not inconceivable the film could benefit the organisation. Winstead is happy for it to have a dual purpose, saying it would be ""fantastic"" if the film was ""used in any sort of positive way"". ""People have come up to me after screenings who work with alcoholics and feel it would be a great tool for them to use,"" she says. ""I think the reason they feel that way is it feels more real than other films on the subject, and a lot more relatable to people of this generation."" Recovery point Smashed is not the only film around at present to have an alcoholic protagonist. Another is Flight, out in the UK in February, in which Denzel Washington plays an airline pilot waging his own battle with the bottle. Winstead admits it is ""interesting"" for the two to emerge at the same time but insists that they are ""very different films"". ""Smashed is about a person getting their life together, while Flight is about somebody in the throes of alcoholism who cant get to that recovery point,"" she muses. Image caption Denzel Washington plays a pilot in Flight found to be harbouring a dark secret ""Although they are both anchored and rooted in alcoholism, they tell very different stories."" ""I think its funny in a quirky, cosmic way that they both came out so close to each other,"" laughs Ponsoldt. ""I just wish we had Flights marketing budget. ""But I see it as a win for everybody. The world is better when both the independents and studios are making movies for adults that deal with serious issues that pertain to everyones lives."" So how does one set about playing an addict? For Aaron Paul, the most effective route to finding his character was also the simplest. ""What I did for research was drink - a lot more than I had ever in my entire life,"" he reveals. ""I filmed myself getting severely intoxicated and I studied the tapes. ""I also went onto YouTube and typed in drunk people acting crazy,"" he continues. ""Its incredible what you can find out there.""

Russia: Government mobile app to help alcoholics,New government app aims to help recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.,,8 September 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Russia has one of the highest alcohol-related mortality rates in the world The Russian government is trying to tackle the countrys notoriously high alcoholism rate with the launch of a free mobile app. The app will provide information for ""people battling addictions that are very hard to fight"" in order to help them to stay clean, says Yevgeny Bryun, the health ministrys leading narcotics official. He tells the M24 news website that it will offer details of nearby support meetings for recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, medical advice on keeping the problem under control, and access to online radio programmes run by Alcoholics Anonymous. The app should be up and running next year, but Mr Bryun says other resources are already being made available, including a new radio network for rehabilitation clinics, where ""specialists and alcoholics will talk about recovering"". Experts are lining up in support of the plan, which they see as a serious attempt to tackle what Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called Russias drinking-culture ""national disaster"". ""Information technology can play a very important role here, as you cant change these patients with pills,"" Dr Oleg Zykov, a leading Moscow drugs specialist, tells M24. Russian men are estimated to drink about 70% more pure alcohol than their American counterparts, and United Nations figures suggest alcohol was the main culprit in 30% of all deaths in Russia in 2012. Government incentives, penalties and price hikes seem to be making little difference. But the ideas keep on coming. In Moscow, a pilot scheme will see the citys health department issue certificates to people who stay clean, and the head of Russias anti-drugs service has even suggested devoting a television channel to helping people beat their addictions.

Running changed former British soldier's life,Gary Edwards wants to inspire others and helped set up a weekly free 5km running event.,,7 April 2019,BBC News,"Image copyright Great Run Local Image caption Gary Edwards said turning to running was ""probably the best thing I could have done"" A former soldier who turned to alcohol, piled on the pounds and then shed 12 stone (76kg) has said he wants to inspire others to take up running. Gary Edwards, 52, was medically discharged from the Army after a truck crash in Germany in 1992. He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his weight increased to 25 stone (159kg). He used running to get his life ""back on track"" and has helped set up a new fun run at Alton Water, in Suffolk. Mr Edwards had served in the Royal Corps of Signals for 10 years when the crash happened, which left him with crush injuries to his legs and abdomen, which required part of his intestine to be removed.

Pakistan battles growing alcohol addiction,"Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.",,16 September 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majority Alcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink. The BBCs Charles Haviland finds lives ruined and clinics and therapy groups trying to overcome a taboo subject. Late one night, the beat of dance music drifts down from an upper storey of an apartment block on the edge of a Pakistani city. Inside the flat, the music is pulsating around a dance floor. There is a bar where a range of liquor is being served and cocktails shaken. Under flashing stroboscopic lights, dozens of people laugh, dance and enjoy the drink. This is one of the parties that are now commonplace in the cities but are highly discreet. The liquor is bought illicitly from bootleggers - or from the regular alcohol shops that are supposed to sell only to minorities holding permits but also sell illegally to large numbers of Muslims. Pakistan even has its own breweries which officially produce only for non-Muslims - or for export. Increasing trend Image caption Mr Ahmed was formerly an alcoholic and now runs a rehabilitation organisation The subculture of liquor enjoyment belies Pakistans status as officially ""dry"". That is, the 96% of Pakistanis who, according to official figures are Muslim, are not supposed to drink. The penalty if they do so is 80 lashes but it is not strictly enforced. Although there are many harmless social gatherings, there is also a growing problem of addiction to the bottle. Officials have told the BBC - while not wanting to be quoted - that alcohol-related diseases have risen by at least 10% in the past five years. Tahir Ahmed, a former alcoholic who now runs a rehabilitation organisation, Therapy Works, detects ""a visibly increasing trend"". Six years ago, when he started this work, most drinkers were in at least their 20s; now, some are as young as 14, he says. I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated - and that really frightened me Sara, Alcoholic in Lahore Sometimes alcohol is taken in conjunction with narcotics. He says alcohol has a much firmer presence in the home - especially for the affluent - and at social occasions like weddings. And he says that if a Pakistani drinks, it is usually in large quantities because it is, he believes, a response to the massive social pressures here, including the threat of political violence and high unemployment. ""Unfortunately drinking in Pakistan is not recreational,"" he said. ""Its much more escapist and much more relief-seeking. That means drink till the bottle is emptied."" Now 65, this is the way he himself used to be. He watched two of his friends die of cirrhosis of the liver and nearly died himself. He decided to stop drinking but went into clinical depression for a year. Only then did he receive therapy, later setting up his organisation, which is registered with Britains Counselling and Psychotherapy Central Awarding Body. Taboo for women Drinking among the affluent is especially noticeable. Some senior politicians are rumoured to drink, and alcohol is served at some high-society events, though never on camera. But it affects everybody. Last month, at least 12 people in Karachi died after drinking toxic home-made liquor. Some Pakistani alcoholics are women. For them, the stigma is all the greater. In Pakistans second city, Lahore, Sara - whose name we have changed - recounts her story. Five years ago, aged 33 and with two teenage children, she got divorced. Then alcoholism just sucked her in. She would go binge-drinking for days at a time and suffer blackouts. ""I would wake up and I would not remember the last two or three days of my life because I was so intoxicated. And that really frightened me."" Image caption Mr Umer said a strict and austere regimen helped him overcome drinking As word got around and she became an embarrassment to her children, Sara wanted to go to a rehabilitation clinic. But being a woman made this very difficult in Pakistan. ""Some men will turn around and say, Okay, I have a problem. But its a taboo for women. A woman will never stand up and say I have a problem and I need help. Thats not acceptable."" Nine months ago, she finally sought assistance and was able to get medicine and therapy-based help at home, from Therapy Works. Now she is recovering. In an unregulated medical market, there are other clinics whose approach to treatment is much more strict. The BBC visited one in Karachi, called Willing Ways, where a group of current and former residents were in a session with the doctor who founded the establishment. Clients are admitted with their families consent, but they do not always realise they will be confined for three months. While living there, they are deprived of all addictive substances including tobacco, and of all external communications. One former patient contacted the BBC and said he felt the set-up was excessively draconian. But a satisfied former client, businessman Yousuf Umer, says the austere regimen worked for him. ""It has changed my life and I am a very successful man now."" Im listening Image caption Dr Mamsa, right, conducts a radio show using a mix of English and Urdu While clinics and therapy-based groups tackle alcoholism, the media is now doing so too. On Karachis Radio 1 91 FM a psychiatrist-broadcaster, Dr Faisal Mamsa, takes calls every Thursday and Friday night on all sorts of social taboos - including this one. ""Go ahead. Im listening,"" he tells callers in soft tones. Sporting a mop of unruly hair and a beard, he wears shorts in the studio. There follows a conversation in a mix of English and Urdu. Calls or texts from affected family members are encouraged. A woman says her husband has been drinking for 13 years but she cannot persuade him to seek help. The doctor suggests they contact Alcoholics Anonymous. The next caller is an addict who admits he is violent. Dr Mamsa says the anonymity of radio makes it ideal for this subject. ""Im not concerned about the name,"" he said. ""If theyre talking about a problem, its not just them whos benefiting out of it but whosoever is listening to the radio is listening about it. What matters is that the problem is being discussed."" There is no chance of Pakistans legally ""dry"" status changing in the near future. Yet there is an alcoholism problem, which officials and doctors say is growing. At least more alcoholics are now coming forward to talk about it - and some are finding a way out of their misery.",{},"['caption', 'growing', 'battles', 'pakistan', 'radio', 'say', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'woman', 'therapy', 'supposed', 'problem', 'addiction', 'social']","Image caption Pakistan is supposed to be officially ""dry"" because of its Muslim majorityAlcoholism is a growing problem in Pakistan despite it being illegal for the Muslim majority to drink.

How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back,The US clothing firm is now enjoying five years of profit growth as it recovers from past woes.,,25 September 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright Levi Strauss Chip Bergh has the air of man at ease with the world. But things could have turned out very different, given what he calls his ""dysfunctional"" childhood. The 60-year-old chief executive of Levi Strauss, dressed in regulation blue jeans and denim shirt, readily admits to be being ""blessed and lucky"". Six years into his successful turnaround of the once struggling US clothing firm, he says the job still gives him a ""wow"" feeling. Mr Bergh and his family also love their San Francisco lifestyle, where the vegan boss pursues a passion for marathons and triathlons. So, professionally and personally, things are going well for the former Procter & Gamble (P&G) executive. But growing up in the suburbs of New York City there were times when he felt neither blessed nor lucky. Mr Berghs father was an advertising salesman working 14-hour days. He was also an alcoholic. Image copyright Devaki Knowles There could be ""lots of screaming and yelling"" at home, Mr Bergh recalls. ""Mum and dad were always getting in fights."" One day his mother threatened to throw out his dad. ""That was a wake up call,"" says Mr Bergh. His father then finally went to Alcoholics Anonymous, cleaned himself up and never touched another drop. ""Im proud that my dad recovered,"" says Mr Bergh. ""He rebuilt his life."" Mr Berghs childhood wasnt unhappy. ""I had a lot of friends, played a lot of sport, and went to a great school,"" he says. But as the eldest of three children he says he shouldered much of the domestic discord, and grew up fast. It left its mark and is in part behind his drive to succeed, he thinks. It also left a determination not to repeat some of his fathers mistakes. ""Im pretty level-headed,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Theres not a lot that really upsets me. Im not a yeller and screamer, at home or work. Im pretty relaxed."" And he doesnt drink. Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption Levi Strauss emigrated to the US from Germany in 1853 when he was 18 So, how does Mr Bergh sum up his management style? ""Very open, honest, transparent. What you see is what you get."" He insists hes ""really down to earth"", adding: ""I put my pants on the same way everybody else does - one leg at a time."" Just dont confuse this regular-guy image with a lack of steel, as Mr Berghs overhaul of Levis has been radical, some might say brutal. The company was created in 1873 when San Francisco-based wholesale merchant Levi Strauss and a business partner patented a way to strengthen denim trousers using copper rivets. The rest as they say is history. Through slick advertising and campaigning on social and political issues (such as donating millions to HIV/Aids charities), Levis punched above its weight for decades. Stories were common in the 1960s and 1970s of young Westerners packing Levis jeans in their luggage to help barter their way through holidays behind the Iron Curtain. If ever a brand deserved the label ""iconic"", Levis was it. Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The Levi 501 jeans are arguably the companys single most important product But by the time Mr Bergh took over in 2011, the company he calls the original Silicon Valley start-up ""had lost its way"". Annual sales peaked in 1997 at $7.1bn (£5.3bn). ""We were bigger than Nike then,"" says Mr Bergh. ""Nike aspired to be like Levis."" But Levis lost its knack of combining heritage with changing trends, and by the early 2000s sales had fallen to $4bn. Competition from the likes of Walmart and Gap had increased rapidly. Levi had also borrowed heavily, chiefly to buy out scores of Strauss family descendants, and consolidate ownership. The result, says Mr Bergh, was that the firm found it had to ""cut costs, cut marketing, to save cash"". Levis board ultimately decided it needed a fresh pair of hands, and so turned to Mr Bergh, who had the brand expertise and international experience it wanted. After 28 years at P&G, most latterly working on the Old Spice deodorant and razors accounts, Mr Bergh saw a chance to fulfil an ambition to become a chief executive. ""It was too good an opportunity to pass,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity to make a difference, and leave a legacy."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chip Bergh is not afraid to ""double denim"" All too aware that Levis was struggling, Mr Bergh sent the firms then top 60 managers six questions about the pros and cons of the business - and started interviewing each of them. ""But by about the 15th interview it was pretty clear what needed to be done,"" he says. ""There was no strategy, there was no alignment across the organisation... People were frustrated."" More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: Mr Bergh invested in facilities, broadened the clothing range (especially womenswear), and expanded in relatively untapped markets such as Russia, China and India. The ecommerce operation, previously outsourced and treated almost as an after-thought, was brought in-house, modernised and expanded. Mr Bergh also changed the top team at the business. Within 18 months of his appointment, nine of the 11-member executive team had left. Of the current 150 senior managers, two-thirds have been with the company for three years or less. He says: ""We needed to change not just the business but the culture, and the best way to change the culture is to change the leadership."" Image copyright Levi Strauss Image caption The original US patent for riveted jeans, from 1873 Mr Bergh admits the clear out was dramatic, sometimes traumatic, but says: ""You always have to do the harder right than the easier wrong."" Did he learn such decisiveness in the army, which he joined for two years after school? Making quick decisions was certainly part of the skill-set, he says. But the army also taught him about leadership. ""Its wrong that the army is all about deference and saluting seniors,"" he says. ""You have to earn respect, build trust, be willing to make decisions, coach people and train people - all those skills are transferable to the corporate world."" The armys downside was that promotion moved slowly, and Mr Bergh wanted to ""move ahead quickly"". A recruitment firm found him a job at P&G.

Adrian Chiles 'horrified' at drinking 100 alcohol units a week,The TV and radio broadcaster revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week.,,21 August 2018,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Presenter Adrian Chiles speaks about alcohol after revealing he sometimes drank 100 units a week. Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week. The BBC 5 live host said it was ""horrifying"" to add up his alcohol consumption, which was well over the recommended weekly 14 units. He was told by a doctor he ""cant carry on like this"" and his liver damage could cause cirrhosis or death. Chiles, 51, has tackled the issue of drinking in a new BBC documentary. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Chiles said: ""I was just staggered what I was putting away"". He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I dont really get drunk, I dont misbehave, I dont drink during the day, I dont drink alone, I dont particularly stay up late. ""I just drink something every day. ""There are loads of us who just drink too much and I just wondered why I was so dependent on it in a small way, or is it a big way."" Chiles comments have prompted many people to speak about their own drinking habits. Actress Linda Robson told ITVs Loose Women she thought ""maybe I could have been on the way to being an alcoholic"" when she used to drink a bottle of wine a night. She said: ""My big thing was because I didnt drink in the daytime then I didnt have a problem and I could make myself wait until that time every night so I obviously didnt have a problem. ""But I was still functioning, I was still coming into work."" We are the problem Chiles - who sees himself as a social drinker and not an alcoholic - said he wanted to make the programme after being interested in peoples ideas of what type of drinking counts as alcoholism. For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking. In an interview with the Times, he said on one morning he calculated that he had drunk more than 100 units in the previous week, whereas other times his weekly amount was 80 units. The NHS advises men and women not to drink more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of wine. Chiles said people like him - the ""constant drinkers, the toppers up"" - are ""the problem"". Although his blood tests were completely normal, a scan showed he had mild to moderate fibrosis of the liver - a type of damage that includes scar tissue forming - and significant liver fat. The doctor told Chiles: ""You cant carry on like this. Youre at risk of disease progression to cirrhosis, liver disease and failure - and death."" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption In his documentary, Chiles is warned by a doctor: ""You cant carry on like this."" Chiles said it might be easier to ""stop completely"" rather than moderating his drinking, which he said requires planning. He said: ""I think middle-aged supposedly moderate drinkers need to take a look at ourselves. ""I encourage anyone, dont judge yourself, dont panic youre not going to drop dead, but go on an app like Drink Less and measure what youre drinking, be honest with yourself for three weeks.""

Presenter Adrian Chiles has urged people to track their alcohol intake after revealing he sometimes drank 80 or 100 units a week.
He said most of his drinking was ""completely mundane and harmless"", adding: ""I don't really get drunk, I don't misbehave, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink alone, I don't particularly stay up late.
For the documentary, called Drinkers Like Us, the TV and radio broadcaster recorded how many units he was drinking.

AA: America's Gift to the World,"AL Kennedy's new Radio 4 documentary - AA: America's Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best 'cure' for addicts given new science and treatments.",,2015-04-01 13:36:32+00:00,BBC,"AL Kennedys new Radio 4 documentary - Americas Gift to the World - tells the story of Alcoholics Anonymous and its methods, and asks whether AA is still the best cure for addicts given new science and treatments. This is the background to the story, and how the making of the programme impacted on its presenter. The initials AA are peripherally familiar to many, as is perhaps the name Alcoholics Anonymous. Nevertheless, I think a lot of people don’t know much about AA or the story of its creation – when Bill Wilson, an alcoholic wall street trader with a big idea about staying sober, met an alcoholic doctor, Bob Smith. They talked and understood each other, helped each other get sober and worked out a way they could pass that on. I’ve seen friends ruin their own lives and those of all around them through dysfunctional drinking: the idea of two people finding a way to unravel that nightmare is truly beautiful and fascinating. AA’s desire to preserve its members privacy and to make no grand statements on issues, meant we had to be sensitive about interviews. It’s also probably one reason why AA isn’t well-known outside its membership. AA’s also an intentionally disorganised organisation. I loved looking at a huge association which seems to do exactly what it intends and yet which is specifically engineered to concentrate power and responsibility downwards and to avoid creating authority figures, funding drives, advertising drives and so forth. It seems to reverse modern thinking about success, but has millions of members, has lasted 80 years and still rolls on. With so many products and experiences now designed to exert an addictive or pseudo-addictive influence, I suppose AA pushes against some powerful trends in society. As was pointed out during my research, alcohol use is central to many of our social occasions, celebrations, even some religious ceremonies. Anyone trying to stay away from drink isn’t going to have it easy. AA isn’t for everyone, but it seems to work very well for those who do use it. What I was struck by most of all was the generosity, honesty and compassion of all our contributors. We have hours of wonderful stories and insights that we just couldn’t fit into the programme. The professionals we spoke to were genuinely passionate about trying to understand alcoholism and help alcoholics to recover. AA members were searingly frank about themselves – and very funny - and really had a grip on who they were and how they could meet the world. We also interviewed Al-Anon and Alateen members – those affected by the drinking of others. Their experiences and bravery were startling, humbling. It was really a privilege to meet them all.

Scheme to tackle A&E violence introduced in Glasgow,"A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, is operating in Glasgow.",,7 June 2016,BBC News,"Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit A project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow. The Navigators Scheme, funded by Police Scotlands Violence Reduction Unit, has been operating at Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) since December. It involves two navigators establishing a connection with people who are victims or perpetrators of violence. They later discuss the agencies and services that can help them. This could include relationship counselling or putting them in touch with organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Shelter. The Navigator scheme is the first to be available for anyone being treated in an accident and emergency department. But a charity in London called Redthread has been running hospital-based violence intervention programmes specifically for young people for the past 11 years No violent oclock Doctors at the GRI said the project was one of the most important innovations they had seen in decades. They hope the scheme can be rolled out to A&E departments across Scotland. Senior consultant, Donogh Maguire, said it was possibly the most valuable non-medical change in the management of A&E in the whole course of his career. Image copyright Violence Reduction Unit Image caption Navigators Tam Begbie and Alan Gilmour have been working at the hospital since December ""I think for inner-city hospitals, this should be a standard means of engaging with the homeless and disenfranchised people that we have coming to our departments,"" he said. ""The reason I say this is because the current mechanisms are failing or the people are not engaging with them, whereas here were getting the navigators catching people at a time when theyre amenable to some intervention."" One of the navigators, Alan Gilmour, said the work was highly unpredictable. ""We dont know whats coming in, we dont know whats happening,"" he said. ""I mean, theres no violent oclock. We begin our shift and we just wait or find out if theres anyone in and if theres not we wait around for that to happen."" By James Shaw, BBC Scotland Its after 10pm on a Thursday in the accident and emergency department at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Tam Begbie is sitting on the hard vinyl floor talking to a young woman with peroxide blonde hair slumped in a chair in front of him. In the hubbub of an A&E starting to get busier as the night goes on, no-one else can hear the substance of their conversation. But that is as it should be. Tam is not talking to the woman to explain her treatment or to find out if shes committed a crime. He is simply trying to help. Because as a navigator, that is his job. The agencies behind this scheme are Police Scotlands Violence Reduction Unit and the doctors group, Medics Against Violence. They decided on the job title, navigator, because it describes the aim of the role, which is to help people steer their way through the agencies that might be able to help them escape the lifestyles that are making them victims and possibly perpetrators of violence. Tam discovers the young woman with the broken wrist got the injury in a fall. It might have happened during an argument with her boyfriend. He is now in the reception area, wanting to see her. Tam might decide that it is not safe for them to get together at this point. Transformative effect But he will advise the young woman that he can meet her to talk about her situation tomorrow or the day after. Maybe in a cafe or fast food restaurant - wherever she feels comfortable. He will suggest places where she might seek help. It might be relationship counselling or Alcoholics Anonymous. Or Shelter if she needs to find somewhere new to live to escape an abusive relationship. The genius of the navigator concept is that it offers help to people in the direst need at exactly the time when they might be most ready to make a change. And it recognises that doctors and police officers cannot always offer permanent solutions to deep-rooted problems. The value of the scheme is fully acknowledged by the head of A&E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Alastair Ireland. He allowed the navigators in last December and has seen the difference they can make. At the moment, this is just a small pilot scheme, but doctors at the GRI agree that having navigators in every A&E in Scotland could have a transformative effect on the problems of violence they and the rest of society have to deal with.",{},"['reduction', 'young', 'navigator', 'help', 'introduced', 'violence', 'scheme', 'tackle', 'navigators', 'woman', 'ae', 'unit', 'glasgow']","Image copyright Violence Reduction UnitA project to tackle violence in A&E departments, thought to be the first of its kind in the UK, has been introduced in Glasgow.

Lars von Trier unsure over film future,Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol.,,1 December 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright AP Image caption Born Lars Trier, he added the Von while at the National Film School of Denmark Danish film director Lars von Trier fears he will not make any more films now he is no longer taking drugs or drinking alcohol. The controversial film-maker, whose films include Nymphomaniac and Breaking the Waves, revealed his concerns in an interview with Danish paper Politiken. He told the broadsheet he no longer drank a bottle of vodka a day or took ""narcotics"". ""I dont know whether I can make more films. And that haunts me,"" he said. ""No creative expression of artistic value has ever been carried out by former alcoholics and drug addicts,"" Von Trier told the newspaper. It was his first interview since Cannes Film Festival organisers banned him from their event in 2011 after he joked he was a Nazi at a news conference to promote his science fiction film Melancholia. Von Trier said he was 90 days sober on Sunday, adding he attended meetings at Alcoholics Anonymous every day. Palme dOr He was quoted by the newspaper as saying he used to drink a bottle of vodka every day but to be creative he combined the alcohol with different kinds of drugs. ""I cant recommend anyone to do the same. It is very dangerous and stupid in every way,"" he said. The director is perhaps best known as a co-signatory of the Dogme 95 manifesto - a ""vow of chastity"" he made with three fellow Danish film-makers. Their films, they declared, would strip away artifice by being shot on location using natural light and handheld cameras. In 2000 Von Trier won the Palme dOr with Dancer in the Dark, a musical starring Icelandic pop star Bjork as a woman who ends up on Death Row. His other films include Dogville, Manderlay and 2009s Antichrist, which whipped up a furore at Cannes with its explicit sex scenes and graphic violence. Von Triers most recent effort, the lengthy and sexually-explicit Nymphomaniac Directors Cut - Volume I and II, has been nominated for best film at the European Film Awards. The awards will be handed out on 13 December in Riga, Latvia, this years European Capital of Culture.

Amazing benefits Jack, who has been a patient at the farm for nine months, said: ""I came to save my life really. I would be dead otherwise, I took heroin, alcohol, pills, anything really.

Serial drink-driver avoids jail 'for being a woman',A judge tells Victoria Parry she would have been sent straight to prison if she were a man.,,12 April 2019,BBC News,"Image copyright Paul Beard Image caption If Victoria Parry had been a man ""it would have been straight down the stairs"" to prison, a judge said A judge gave a serial drink-driver a chance to avoid jail because she is a woman. Victoria Parry, 30, hit three other cars after downing a bottle of wine. Judge Sarah Buckingham said Parry, an alcoholic who had escaped an abusive relationship, would have gone ""straight down the stairs"" to jail if she were a man. Although Parry ""deserved"" a prison term, the judge gave her three months to address her issues. The comments are being investigated by a judicial watchdog. Prosecutor Tim Sapwell said Parry caught a vans rear bumper, a Vauxhall Insignias wing mirror, then the side of a BMW ""very heavily"" in the crash. Shocking case He told Warwick Crown Court it caused her Fiat to spin off the A46 near Stratford-upon-Avon into a wooded area where it caught fire. An off-duty police officer pulled her from the car, and Parry, who was banned from the road at the time, told him she had drunk a bottle of wine and ""shouldnt be driving"", Mr Sapwell said. She was arrested, and registered a reading of almost three times the legal limit at a police station. Lucy Tapper, defending, said Parry had a ""considerable drink problem"" after a 15-year abusive relationship, but had begun to tackle her alcohol intake. The judge said: ""If Miss Parry was a man, there is no question it would have been straight down the stairs, because this is a shocking case of dangerous driving against a background of two previous convictions for excess alcohol."" But, she said, the offence had been committed in May 2018, and Parry, who had admitted dangerous driving, had not been in trouble since. ""She has clearly got an alcohol problem. She is, whether she admits it or not, an alcoholic,"" the judge said. Deferring sentencing for three months, judge Buckingham told Parry she ""richly deserved"" an immediate custodial term of 18 months. ""I want to see whether you can really address the issues rather than paying lip service,"" she said. She ordered Parry to abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and pay for private counselling. If Parry complied, she said, the custody would not be made immediate. ""If you dont comply, I will conclude that you are not worthy of the chance,"" the judge added.

Gazza rehab: Paul Gascoigne reveals US clinic drama,Football star Paul Gascoigne reveals he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab in the US.,,10 March 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Concerns for Gascoignes wellbeing were raised again earlier this year Football star Paul Gascoigne has revealed he thought he was going to die during his most recent spell in rehab. The former England midfielder has flown back to the UK after more than a month at a clinic in Phoenix, Arizona, that specialises in treating alcoholism. The 45-year-old told the Sun newspaper that he heard three doctors conclude he was going to pass away, before he slipped into a three-day coma. His life was saved, but Gascoigne said: ""I thought I was on my way out."" Fresh fears for the health of Gascoigne, who has battled against alcoholism for several years, emerged at a public appearance in Northampton in January. Total wreck Within days, he had been flown to the private clinic in the US and Gascoigne - nicknamed Gazza - said he begged its doctors at the clinic to save his life as he went through the detox process. Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink Organise their lifestyle around drinking Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol ""Three doctors didnt think I would make it,"" he said. ""It has got to inspire me to never let this happen again. Ive come through that - death. I was dead."" He added: ""I thought I was on my way out. I looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck."" Gascoigne, whose football clubs included Newcastle United, Tottenham, Lazio, Rangers and Everton, has had a long-term battle against alcohol addiction. He said his latest problems started in Dubai last summer when he started drinking alcohol again after 17 months ""dry"". The ex-footballer said he followed that by staying off alcohol for the following six months, but his own despair at his lapse meant that he failed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and isolated himself, barely eating. ""I was living like a dry drunk,"" he said. Eventually, he succumbed and started drinking heavily again, a situation which came to public attention at the Northampton charity event when he broke down sobbing on stage. On his admission to the US treatment centre, Gascoignes management company said he was alcoholic with ""complex issues"" which were being dealt with by professionals. It has since emerged that the public appearance could still raise thousands of pounds for charity. Gascoigne said he had no recollection of being there. Another chance Gascoignes drinking problems started during his playing days - he was admitted to the Priory Hospital, near Southampton, in 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl. Three years later, while playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith. In 2008, four years after retiring, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act. He was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead. More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and at the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth. Gascoigne told the Sun that the way forward for him now was to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings again. ""Meetings are really important. I was too weak, I stopped going to them.

Church rebuilds 1960s singer's life,A 1960s singer songwriter tells an audience in Redruth how his faith helped him to rebuild his life.,,26 October 2011,BBC News,"Image caption John Gaughan worked with many big names in the 1960s but hid his alcoholism for many years From his early teens John Gaughan decided that he wanted to be a singer/songwriter and aim for the very top in the world of popular music. By the time he was 19 years old he had achieved that goal. Mr Gaughan was rubbing shoulders with the most successful writers and publishers of the day. He was also singing with the top stars of the 1960s, as part of the band Hermans Hermits. Mr Gaughan said: ""I was working with Billy J Kramer and Gerry Marsden and in America with Peter Noone and the Bee Gees."" But there was one problem, as he will tell an audience at Redruths Penventon Park Hotel on Friday 28th October. ""My life had really changed, but the only thing that remained constant was that I was an alcoholic. I had the money, and most of the time the alcohol was free."" Mr Gaughan said he felt a huge ""emptiness inside that was increasingly being satisfied by alcohol"". Image caption John Gaughan worked with bands, including the Bee Gees ""On the surface it looked absolutely fantastic. Behind the scenes I had to have a quarter bottle of vodka. I was walking a fine line between not having too much alcohol in my body and having just enough to stop me from shaking on stage."" Eventually his dependence on alcohol took over and within a few years he was a broken man, ""in body, soul and spirit"". Mr Gaughan said: ""I thought I could control it. I would give up drinking for a day, apart from the shakes. I went to my doctor and he said I would just have to give up drinking. I tried clinics, I tried hospitals. But nothing seemed to help. The desire was still there. ""Finally I couldnt cope. My marriage failed and my father died. That just left me devastated."" Mr Gaughan eventually reached a point of total desperation and tried to end it all by throwing himself from the top window of a three storey building. Life changing moment He said: ""I thought I had no hope and no future. So I tried to take my own life. But I landed on my feet. I broke all the bones in my feet. Bones in my back were crushed. Yet my spinal chord remained intact."" During the following months many people called to see him. Mr Gaughan said: ""I was sat their drinking one night, watching the television, thinking Im just going to lose everything again. But words came back to me about the time my Grandma told me about God. So I went to church that night. Nobody spoke to me, and I came away disappointed and went back home and sat there drinking. ""That night a man came to see me and said you dont need to be like that, there is a way out. As he was walking passed my flat he said he felt the need to come and knock on my door and tell me about Jesus. He invited me to his church. I went, and that night my life started to change."" For the past two decades John said he had been given songs by the Lord and his hearts desire was ""to continue to touch peoples lives through testimony and song"".

Lou Vincent: The most brutal form of apology,Cricketer Lou Vincent this week admitted he was a cheat. His apology came in stark style.,,5 July 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lou Vincent The cricketer Lou Vincent has admitted attempting to fix matches. His apology came in stark style. He exhales loudly. Then he begins his statement: ""My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat."" The former New Zealand cricketer, in 10 words, admits what he has done, how he has contravened and undermined his own sport by accepting money for match-fixing. Viewers are left in no doubt. Vincent, at the age of 35, has been banned for life from playing, coaching or participating in any other way in organised cricket after breaching 18 anti-corruption rules in matches played in 2008 and 2011. Even so, the nature of the opening of his video confession - in which he goes on to say he has ""shamed"" his sport, country and family - seems unusually stark. The formula of the opening words is the same as that used by some members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Those attending at meetings are not compelled to say: ""My name is XXXX and I am an alcoholic."" But many choose to do so, citing its cathartic effect and the creation of a sense of community. Vincent, who has suffered from depression, is unlikely to feel the same immediate mutual support from his fellow cricketers. But might he eventually gain respect for his statement, in which he also says he wants to face up to what he has done ""like a man and accept the consequences""? ""Its very healthy,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. ""You dont get enough of people admitting when theyve done something wrong, particularly in the workplace."" Image copyright Reuters Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez has faced criticism over his initial refusal to apologise for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in a World Cup match. He has since given a qualified apology - one that expressed sympathy for his victim but did not fully address Suarezs culpability and ongoing problem. ""What the cricketer has done is completely unlike the Suarez situation,"" says Cooper. ""If Suarez had come out straight away and said hed done wrong under the stress of the situation he would have received much more sympathy. Whats happened here in cricket will raise Vincent in peoples estimation. The timing is absolutely key."" Vincent recorded his statement after admitting to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that he had committed match-fixing offences in Twenty20 games when he played for Lancashire and Sussex. It pre-empted the ECBs own announcement. Sussex County Cricket Club has welcomed the punishment of Vincent, who has played in 23 Tests and 102 one-day internationals. ""The episode has been a very difficult time for our players, staff and indeed all supporters of Sussex Cricket,"" says chief executive Zac Toumazi. ""We are determined to do all we can to drive this issue away from our game and remain vigilant and committed in doing so."" Cricket is keen to clean up its image after revelations going back more than a decade, when it was revealed the South African captain Hansie Cronje had fixed matches. In his confession in 2000, Cronje opened by saying he had been a Christian all his life and had tried to ""walk the way the Lord wanted me to walk"". Hansie Cronje Image copyright Getty Images Image caption South Africa cricket captain Hanse Cronje confessed to match fixing in 2000 Right-handed middle-order batsman appointed South Africa captain in 1994, aged 24 Charged by Indian police in April 2000 with fixing one-day international matches, but initially denied wrongdoing Sacked as captain four days later when he changed his story and admitted taking money to provide information to gambling interests Banned from cricket for life in June 2000 Died in plane crash in South Africas Western Cape in 2002 The golfer Tiger Woods, in his scripted 2010 apology in front of the worlds media for his marital infidelities, also adopted a more gradual introduction to the description of his wrongdoings than Vincent. ""Good morning. And thank you for joining me,"" he said. ""Many of you in the room are my friends. Many of you in this room know me. Many of you have cheered for me, or worked with me, or supported me, and now, every one of you has good reason to be critical of me. ""I want to say to each of you, simply, and directly, I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behaviour I engaged in."" Could Vincents more direct statement lead to some form of public redemption, even if it does not, and cannot, involve any future involvement with cricket? ""What he has done is probably the best way,"" says speechwriter and presentation coach Max Atkinson. ""It reminds me of (Liberal Democrat leader) Paddy Ashdown in 1992 admitting he had had an affair. That worked. He came across as honest. Its best just to come out and say it."" The difference is that Ashdown could argue his personal life did not interfere with his professional one. Like Cronje, Vincent cannot. But Peter Davies, a consultant at Manchester PR firm RMS, thinks there is a chance of a return to some standing. ""Lou Vincents statement comes across like its personal,"" he says. ""Thats good. Although he must have had advice, probably including from his lawyers, it doesnt sound like that. Its not over-scripted and he does it in his own voice. ""But Vincent has lots of work to do if he wants to change his image. Hell have to do something to show hes trying to make a difference and hes truly changed his ways.""

Trending: Why Jim Wolf's makeover video went viral,A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has garnered more than 13 million YouTube hits in a week - but why do stories about the homeless gain such traction on social media? BBC Trending investigates.,,14 November 2013,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The two-hour make-over of a US Army veteran is shown in two minutes A time-lapse makeover of a homeless US man has been watched more than 13 million times on YouTube in the past week. In two minutes, former soldier Jim Wolf is shown making the transition from bearded and bedraggled to well-groomed and sharply-suited. Since then, the 54-year-old - who has long struggled against poverty, homelessness and alcoholism - has reportedly started to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and is now staying with his sister. Producer Rob Bliss made the video to raise awareness and funds for a Grand Rapids homeless charity, Degage Ministries - which has received $50,000 (£30,000) in donations as a result. Mr Wolfs is not the first story of this kind to gain such traction in social media networks. In September, donations of more than $110,000 (£70,000) poured in for Glen James, a homeless man in Boston who returned a lost bag containing £26,000 in cash and travellers cheques. Billy Ray Harris was able to buy himself a house in Kansas with £110,000 given by strangers touched by his honesty after he returned a £2,500 diamond ring accidentally dropped into his change cup earlier this year.

The release of the Jim Wolf video - timed to coincide with Veterans Day - has focused minds on the issue of homelessness. Even so, Mr Bliss, who makes viral videos for a living, described the response as ""pretty incredible"" - far outperforming any other content he has produced. ""The number one thing that makes a video likely to go viral is the feeling it creates,"" he told the BBC. ""The stronger that feeling, the more successful it will be."" Alastair Murray, Project Director at Housing Justice, a UK-based Christian campaigning charity says the video reminds the audience of the possibility of losing a job, a home, and a stable life. ""This video helps people see the real person behind that bearded needy person about whom they feel awkwardness - theres a transformation into a person with whom youd be happy to have a chat,"" he says.

Peter Holder jailed for 1988 rape of woman,A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago is jailed.,,12 September 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright Police Image caption Peter Holder admitted the charges at Reading Crown Court last month A man who dragged a woman from a phone box and raped her 26 years ago has been jailed for 11 and a half years after a review linked his DNA to the crime. Peter Holder was 22 when he grabbed the 30-year-old woman in Reading and raped her in a car park. He drove her two miles before letting her go. Holder, 48, from Tippett Rise, pleaded guilty in August to rape. Reading Crown Court heard Holder was jailed for three years and four months in 2010 for another historical crime. Holder pleaded guilty to an attempted rape he committed 1987 - five months before the Reading attack - following another cold case review. Frightened to go out Holder, who also admitted indecent assault and kidnap in relation to the 1988 attack, was only arrested in May this year when modern technology identified DNA found on the woman belonged to him. Judge Joanna Cutts said the delay was caused either because of the technology at the time not identifying the DNA or because there had been no match found at the time. On the night of the attack the woman had been drinking after leaving an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Alan Blake, prosecuting, said she realised that she was not safe to walk home so she went into a phone box in Watlington Street to call a taxi. Holder and another man dragged her out before he raped and indecently assaulted her. The woman was driven to Shinfield where she was freed. Further details about the other man were not mentioned in court. Reading the victims impact statement, Judge Cutts said: ""Peter Holder took away my life. He took away all my self-worth."" Judge Cutts added: ""She has been unable to work since the incident. She is still all these years later frightened to go out.""

The headstones with unusual stories to tell,A tour around the interesting stories found lurking in English graveyards.,,2 July 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Cemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them. Burial grounds such as Highgate in north London, which host the graves of the rich and famous, draw thousands of visitors. But there are scores of other less well known but interesting graves around England. The barmaid who taunted a tiger Image copyright Getty Images In 1703, Hannah Twynnoy became Britains first recorded victim of a tiger. She was a barmaid at the White Lion in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, when a travelling menagerie set up in the pubs large rear yard, ready to attract paying crowds. Hannah was warned against upsetting the tiger but she enjoyed bothering and poking at the big cat - until one day it discovered the cage door was open. Fed up of the pesky barmaid, the tiger launched itself on the unfortunate servant and mauled her to death. The stone, in Malmesbury Abbey has the epitaph: In bloom of life Shes snatched from hence She had not room to make defence; For Tyger fierce Took life away And here she lies In a bed of clay Until the Resurrection Day. The diver who saved a cathedral Image copyright FindaGrave/Getty Images William Walker was a deep-sea diver who, in 1905, was employed to help repair the foundations of Winchester Cathedral. Large cracks had appeared in the cathedrals walls and vaulted ceilings, some of which were wide enough for owls to roost in. Because Winchester has a high underlying water table and the cathedral is built on peaty soil, trenches dug below filled with water before any reinforcing work could be done. So Walker, who usually worked at Portsmouth dockyard, was recruited. A tunnel was excavated beneath the building and for six years he spent nearly six hours a day underwater, in darkness, replacing and shoring up the foundations with his bare hands. He worked entirely by touch. Eventually he propped the cathedral up with 900,000 bricks, 114,900 concrete blocks and 25,800 bags of cement. Because it took him so long to put on and take off his heavy diving suit, when he stopped for a break he would just take off his helmet in order to eat his lunch and smoke his pipe. As if that was not enough effort, each weekend he cycled 150 miles - home to Croydon, south London, before returning to work on Monday. He died aged 49 during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. His grave, at Beckenham Cemetery in Bromley, south-east London, bears the words: ""The diver who with his own hands saved Winchester Cathedral."" The soldier whose beer was too weak In Winchester, there is a grave which pays homage to a 26-year-old grenadier in the North Regiment of the Hants Militia. Thomas Thetcher died after drinking contaminated small (weak) beer when he was hot. Before the invention of modern sanitation, people would drink small beer when fresh water was unavailable. This was because the alcohol was toxic to water-borne pathogens. However, it was not enough to prevent Thetcher catching a fever and dying. Following his death in 1764, his comrades arranged for a jocular headstone inscription warning of the dangers of drink. It read: Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadier, Who caught his death by drinking cold small beer, Soldiers be wise from his untimely fall And when yere hot drink strong or none at all. In 1918, the tombstone caught the attention of a young American soldier called Bill Wilson, who was camped nearby with his US Army unit. Twenty-one years later, following a battle with alcoholism, he founded Alcoholics Anonymous and in 1939 published a book about his experience. In it he claimed the gravestone had been an ""ominous warning which I failed to heed"", and printed the first two lines of the verse in the front of his book. However, it appears he misunderstood the headstone, as he missed out the crucial advice about only drinking strong beer. On 12 May - the anniversary of Thetchers death - people gather at the grave to drink (strong) beer and raise a glass to the grenadier. Peter the Wild Boy Image copyright Neale Monks/Historic Royal Palaces Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725. He could not talk, and would scamper about on all fours rather than walk. When he was about 12 he was brought to London by King George I where he became a ""human pet"" at Kensington Palace. However, his inability to learn table manners or speech, hatred of wearing clothes - even his specially-made green velvet suit - and lack of decorum led to him falling out of favour. The court paid for him to retire to a Hertfordshire farm with a generous pension and when he died, aged about 72, the locals paid for a headstone. Even today, flowers are laid on his grave. Peters funeral was held at St Marys Church, Northchurch, Hertfordshire, and was paid for by the government. His gravestone was provided by local people. At the time, courtiers assumed Peters behaviour was the result of being brought up by wolves or bears. However, modern analysis of a portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome. The bleeding tombstone of Richard Smith St Marys Church in Hinckley, Leicestershire, is the last resting place of Richard Smith who was killed on 12 April 1727, aged 20. Although his headstone is fairly run-of-the-mill, the story behind his death serves as an abject warning to young men with a fondness for messing about when they should be paying attention. According to the local history club, a recruiting sergeant for the army had come to Hinckley and was singing the praises of taking the Kings shilling. Richard, rather than listening, made jokes and quips until the recruiter lost his temper. In a slight overreaction, the soldier gave the crowd an unplanned demonstration in how to use a pike in close quarter combat - and killed Richard. For years there were reports of the headstone appearing red and tradition held the gravestone sweated blood on the anniversary of the murder. However, a more prosaic explanation was suggested by a researcher in 1936. The gravestone used to be positioned under a block of red sandstone and it was thought that the ""blood"" being sweated may have resulted in water dripping from this block. The Woodplumpton Witch Nestled among the neat headstones at St Annes churchyard in Woodplumpton, near Preston, is a boulder marking the grave of Meg Shelton. Known as ""the Fylde Hag"", she was accused of witchcraft in the late 17th Century. Allegations centred on the fairly tame ""stealing milk"" and the more-impressive ""turning herself into a animal"". She was killed in mysterious circumstances when a barrel crushed her against the wall of her cottage. Folklore has it she dug her way out of her grave on more than one occasion. She was eventually buried head down in a narrow shaft so that if she tried to claw her way out she would be heading in the wrong direction - and instead burrow her way to Hell. The boulder was put on top as an extra way of keeping her anchored in the grave. According to legend, if you walk three times around the boulder while chanting ""I dont believe in witches"", Megs bony hand will rise from her grave and grasp your ankle.",{},"['water', 'gravestone', 'way', 'london', 'unusual', 'headstones', 'winchester', 'headstone', 'grave', 'drink', 'copyright', 'death', 'tell']","Image copyright Getty ImagesCemeteries offer a heady mix of history, beauty, nature and death to those who enjoy browsing around them.

Manchester riots: Doughnut thief jailed for 16 months,A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre is jailed for 16 months.,,18 August 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Thomas Downey had spent his only £4 on tobacco A man who helped himself to doughnuts from a Krispy Kreme shop during riots in Manchester city centre has been jailed for 16 months. Thomas Downey, 48, was released from HMP Manchester on 9 August shortly before getting caught up in the riots. The serial offender went to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous before downing a bottle of sherry and stumbling into Krispy Kreme in Piccadilly Gardens. He was caught with a box of doughnuts when 20 riot officers arrived. Downey admitted burglary and breach of an Asbo by entering part of the city centre from which he is prohibited. Judge Robert Atherton, sentencing at Manchester Crown Court, told him: ""You drink too much, too regularly and when in drink become threatening and abusive."" Expressed remorse The total cost of damage to the shop - which was unsecured before Downey went in for the doughnuts - was about £17,000, prosecutors said. The court heard he had more than 100 convictions for 233 offences and had been released from prison at 19:30 BST that day. Zoe Nield, for Downey, said her client had left jail with only £4 in his pocket. He was not involved in rioting but took the doughnuts because he was hungry, having spent his money on tobacco, she said. She added: ""He cant recall the events because he was drunk but he has expressed remorse."" Among the others to be sentenced was David Swarbrick, 25, was jailed for two years after he stole £25 worth of Oil of Olay from a Quality Save store in Parker Street, which was unsecured after an earlier attack. Thrown away Swarbrick, of Aston Old Road, Openshaw, admitted burglary and breach of a suspended sentence order. Father-of-four Anthony Winder, 38, looted the Swarovski Crystal store and smashed a display cabinet to get an ornamental dog, the court heard. He was also jailed for two years.

Briege OHara, 61, from Antrim Road, Belfast, was jailed for nine months on Monday. She was driving on the wrong side of the road on 27 August 2013, when she hit another motorist and injured him. The court was told that she knew the man whom she injured and was ""entirely remorseful"". A prosecuting lawyer said the crash happened at 11:30 BST on the Antrim Road. OHara had driven around a bend on the wrong side of the road and the van ""didnt have a chance"" to move out of her way. She was arrested and tests showed she had been driving whilst over the limit. OHara said she could not remember the crash. She said she had taken a glass of wine and 5mgs of Diazepam before leaving the house. She pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily injury by dangerous driving and also driving with excess alcohol. The van driver, a man in his mid 60s, broke his sternum and left hand in the collision and lost his job as a delivery driver as a result. He was treated in hospital for his injuries. A defence lawyer said that while the incident was ""utterly disgraceful"", his client was ""entirely remorseful"". He said that she had spent 12 weeks in residential care for alcohol addiction problems almost immediately after causing the crash and had not taken alcohol since then. Her lawyer said she had had a very difficult life and was emotionally fragile. OHara was sentenced to 18 months. She will spend half of this time in prison, with the remaining nine months spent on supervised licence.

"Ulster Bank: Man jailed for stealing £11,000 from faulty ATM","A recovering alcoholic is jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine.",,13 April 2016,BBC News,"Image copyright PA Image caption A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on June 22, 2012, Ulster Bank had experienced a computer malfunction in its system A recovering alcoholic has been jailed for four months for stealing £11,000 from a faulty Ulster Bank cash machine. A judge told Peter Anthony Young, 58, of Hunters Way, Ardglass, that he had ""deliberately taken advantage  of the major glitch in the banks system almost four years ago. It meant customers could withdraw funds from ATM machines without affecting their balance. Following a check, the bank discovered the money had been withdrawn by Young. A prosecution lawyer told Downpatrick Crown Court that on 22 June 2012, Ulster Bank had ""experienced a computer malfunction in its system . ""Following a check, Ulster Bank discovered that Young, who was one of its customers, had £11,000 withdrawn from his account on that day,  said Ms Ivers. The judge was told there had been 22 separate withdrawals of £500 on the day in question. The prosecution lawyer said the bank made repeated attempts to contact Young without success before eventually reporting the incident to police as ""fraudulent . The PSNI started an investigation and Young voluntarily attended a police station and admitted making the withdrawals, telling police he had ""spent the money on drink . The prosecution lawyer said the accused, who was a customer of the Ulster Bank, had ""made no effort to pay back the funds  and the outstanding balance he owed now stood at £10,908.40. A defence lawyer described it as an ""unusual case  and said that when Young was interviewed by police in September 2014 he made ""frank admissions  to his crimes. ""Reading between the lines from the court papers, it appears Mr Young was in the company of other people drinking with them that day and when he was taking money out it became apparent to him and the others that there was a fault with this machine,"" he told the court. ""This was always going to come home to him. Downward spiral ""He is not in the least blaming others.  The defence lawyer said that Youngs life had ""taken a downward spiral  following the death of his mother in 1991 and said that by the age of 34 he was an alcoholic, homeless and ""living on the streets of Belfast . The lawyer added that the father-of-five was now a recovering alcoholic, who was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, was part of a church group and was also attending a rehabilitation programme. The defence lawyer said Young could be made the subject of a community order which ""would leave something hanging over his head that would remind him not to stray from the straight and narrow again . ""I would urge the court to give him a chance to continue to improve himself,  the lawyer added. The judge said Young had gone to the machine on one occasion to withdraw £500 on the day in question. ""He chose to return to this machine a further 21 times to withdraw the money when he knew he did not have the funds in his account,"" he said. ""He knew full well what he was doing and he deliberately took advantage of the defective ATM."" The judge said Young, who is living on social security benefits, had not repaid any money he had stolen from the Ulster Bank.

Jail for trucker caught almost six times drink drive limit,A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit is jailed for four months.,,21 September 2016,BBC News,"Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving conviction A man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months. A court was told motorists contacted police to report James Gallaghers white Scania being driven erratically on the M80. Gallagher, 49, was stopped by officers near Pirnhall Services, Stirling and found to be smelling strongly of alcohol. He was also banned from driving for three years at Stirling Sheriff Court. The court was told that Gallagher was stopped by police at 14:25 and, despite having had his last drink the previous night, was still 5.95 times the legal limit. Gallagher, of Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, pleaded guilty to drink driving, and confessed to a social worker who prepared a background report that he would routinely drive his tipper truck with the same amount of alcohol in his body. Previous conviction The court heard he had a previous conviction for drink-driving in 1998, when he was banned for 14 months. James McLean, defending, said his client was ashamed of his actions, and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous. He asked the court not to jail Gallagher, but to impose a community sentence instead. Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Gallagher: ""You were nearly six times the limit, and that is a significant figure from the point of view of the level of impairment. ""What is of equal concern is that you were driving an HGV, a 12-tonne tipper lorry, and you had been doing it all day, and it is clear that this alcohol level arose from alcohol you had drunk the previous evening. ""These are huge aggravations for a serious offence, and in these circumstances there is no sentence other than a custodial sentence that is appropriate.""",{},"['drive', 'sentence', 'told', 'times', 'gallagher', 'limit', 'jail', 'alcohol', 'court', 'trucker', 'previous', 'caught', 'driving', 'drink', 'stirling']","Image copyright Google Image caption Stirling Sheriff Court was told James Gallagher has a previous drink driving convictionA man who drove a 12-tonne lorry while almost six times the drink-driving limit has been jailed for four months.

Recovering Durham alcoholic starts blog to help others,A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his experiences in beating his addiction in an online blog designed to help others.,,5 May 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Martin Prest drank 83 units in two days A recovering alcoholic from Durham is sharing his thoughts and experiences in an online blog to help others beat the addiction. Martin Prest has been sober for 18 months following his daily battle with drink for the past eight years. He regularly used to drink about 18 pints a day. He has now set up the informative blog, Open Alcoholic, to catalogue his experience battling alcohol addiction. ""I thought that alcoholism is so difficult sometimes to understand from the outside if you havent lived it, and after speaking to people over my 18 months sobriety... family members or people who care about them, they cant necessarily understand,"" Mr Prest said. ""Theyve asked me what its like and to try an explain this process, this mindset, that theyve watched destroy someone and I really wanted to use the website to try and explain it better."" My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking Martin Prest The 26-year-old uses his blog to explain how he came to terms with his addiction and overcame it, but how it still troubles him. Mr Prest unknowingly had his first taste of alcohol when he was just seven-years-old. ""It was funny because I didnt know it was alcoholic and I knew I wasnt allowed to drink it,"" he said. ""I started stealing sips of it in the morning when I was seven, it was on a top shelf on a cupboard and I could nip up and get it and have a sip, just because I liked the taste of it, I didnt know what it was or anything."" Following this early taste his drinking habits became out of control from the age of 18 and he went from being a social drinker to drinking alone and getting drunk. ""I drank until I was drunk and could finally fall asleep, everyday for years. The only time I actually noted down how much I drank was my last weekend drinking,"" he said. ""I knew I was going to stop drinking, I was sort of saying farewell to it and I drank through 83 units in two days, I was drinking mostly bitters and real ale and thats 18 pints and I wasnt drunk - I could still walk straight and I was still holding conversations and stuff, I mean how much I drank when I did get drunk I have no idea, more than that."" Spontaneously haemorrhaging After years of destroying his body through drink, his health problems became visible. ""My entire body was falling apart, I had nothing left in life but the drinking,"" he said. ""I was spontaneously haemorrhaging, I was bleeding out of my face from the damage that was being done, my head was just exploding in pain constantly my body was just wrecked. I knew I had to stop drinking."" Mike Scott, a GP in Newcastle, said: ""Liver disease can lose the bloods ability to clot, so therefore you tend to bleed more easily. ""A cut or damage to the skin is arguably going to bleed more with an unhealthy liver."" Mr Prest, added: ""Its such an insane process because you lose everything and it ruins your life essentially, I mean Ive obviously picked back up again but you still want to drink you still want to get drunk, it never ever goes away, its just engrained in your personality.""

Recovery movement helps addicts kick the habit in Liverpool,"How former addicts in Liverpool are trying a new programme to kick the habit, as figures show deaths from alcohol are on the increase.",,26 January 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good ""Ah boom chikka boom!"" sings the choir leader. ""Ah boom chikka boom! "" sing back the twenty or so members of the choir. The Raucous Caucus Recovery Chorus is made up mainly of former drug users and alcoholics from Liverpool. They rehearse in a small room at an addiction charity office and you have to be sober to sing: all members pledge that theyve been off drink or drugs for at least 24 hours. Being in the choir is part of the treatment for these former users, doing something normal like singing with other people. But the choir has a wider significance as the public face of a new programme in tackling addiction called Recovery - a movement in which Liverpool is playing a leading role. Rather than manage an addiction with drug substitutes or controlled drinking, people go through detox and then practise total abstinence. Animal existence Drink-related deaths in the North West are among the highest with men accounting for two-thirds of such deaths in the UK. And figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the problem is getting worse. In the Land of Recovery, its the guinea pigs that wear the white coats. Mark Gilman , NHS Treatment Agency More people in the UK died from alcohol-related conditions in 2010 than in 2009 with the figure rising by 126 to 8,790 from 8,664. But to understand why Liverpool is leading the way in this new idea, we need to go back in time. In the 1980s, it was one of the cities to bear the brunt of a new drug problem - the arrival of brown powder heroin. Addicts stole to feed their cravings, and transmitted HIV and other infections by using dirty needles. To cut crime and improve health, Liverpool was one of the first places to pioneer harm reduction treatments. Users were prescribed methadone to keep them off heroin. It worked, but many people spent years on methadone, and remained addicts. Raucous Caucus singer Colin used drugs for 22 years, and was on methadone for 17. ""Id have done anything for my drugs."" he said. ""I lived an animal existence."" Now, being in the choir is vital for him. ""I love it,"" he said. ""Its really positive for me."" Children of addicts The idea of Recovery, of staying off drink and drugs for good, has been around for some time. Image caption Former addict Colin has been off drugs for two years thanks to the Recovery programme It started in America, but is now taking hold in the UK. Liverpool is still a relatively poor city with high unemployment and poor housing which partly explains why drug and drink addiction is so high; there are twelve Alcoholics Anonymous meetings here every week. It also explains why Liverpool is at the forefront of the movement in England. Jacquie Johnston-Lynch, of Action on Addiction, said: ""Liverpool has the highest number of [Recovery] Fellowships per head of population in Europe."" Liverpool was where the UKs first Recovery March took place in 2009 and Action on Addiction has opened an alcohol-free bar called The Brink. But the idea of ""Recovery"" has sparked furious debate in drug treatment circles. Some dont like the idea of users taking more responsibility for their own treatment. Mark Gilman, leader of the NHS Treatment Agency, said: ""In the Land of Recovery, its the guinea pigs that wear the white coats."" But Martin says Recovery is important because it could put an end to the problem where the children of addicts become addicts themselves. ""If you get this right, youre the firewall between the intergenerational transfer of addiction,"" he said. ""It sounds grand, but thats the prize on offer.""",{},"['movement', 'helps', 'drugs', 'choir', 'users', 'kick', 'recovery', 'liverpool', 'addicts', 'idea', 'drug', 'treatment', 'habit', 'boom', 'addiction']","Image caption Addicts on the Recovery programme are hoping to kick the habit for good""Ah boom chikka boom!""

"When the US president travels, the world stands still",Life in a security bubble is necessary for the president – and claustrophobic. Here’s an insider’s account.,,21 July 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Not quite a simple walk in the park when Dad is the president of the United States US President Barack Obama pines for the moment when he can leave the security bubble. After 24 hours inside it, I can see why. Mr Obama and his daughter Sasha, 14, walk across a tarmac in New York on Friday. He taps her shoulder and points towards Manhattan, showing her the world, or at least his version of it. What a place. They fly on Air Force One to one of New Yorks airports - and minutes later arrive by helicopter in Manhattan. Streets are blocked off, and their motorcade glides to the Upper East Side. They run red lights - at least 26 over the weekend. Along the way people cheer. At one point a woman in a flowery sundress holds up a handmade sign: ""FREE HUGS"". Its a New York fantasy, one of the perks of Mr Obamas job. He travels in a security zone, a ""bubble"" as its known - a tightly managed network of aircrafts, vehicles and communication that lets him move easily around the world. Image caption At a briefing Mr Obama says he likes to travel when hes free to go where he wants The bubble provides safety, but its confining. In a recent briefing he sounded wistful about an upcoming trip to Kenya, his fathers homeland. He made it clear hed rather go without security restrictions. ""Ill be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as president,"" Mr Obama said. ""Because I can actually get outside of a hotel room or a conference centre."" He still has 18 months left in the bubble, though. For that reason its worth looking at the experience - and considering what it means in terms of his worldview. The presidential bubble is thick - and pricey. Mr Obama rides in the motorcade in a limousine known as the Beast, which is designed to withstand bullets and chemical attacks. Mr Obama flies on a Boeing 747 jet that costs $180,000 (£116,000) per hour to operate - and can be refuelled in the middle of a flight. Electronic equipment on board is designed to withstand all kinds of duress, including force from an electromagnetic pulse, according to White House officials. On the aircraft Mr Obama has a suite with its own bathroom, as well as an office and a conference room. He has access to classified material, and he can communicate with military officials if the US is under attack or is facing another kind of emergency. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Obama shows his daughter around New York - under tight security There is a saying in the UK that everything smells like fresh paint to the Queen because wherever she goes, things are done up. Here in the US presidents are treated like royalty. When you climb onto Air Force One, it smells like leather. The seats are business-class sized, even in the back. Im a new ""supplementary"" member of the ""travel pool"", a group of journalists who accompany Mr Obama on trips so they can report on whats euphemistically known as a ""transformative moment"" - for example, if the president gets shot. It also gives reporters a chance to experience in a visceral way presidential life on the road. As we get settled, a flight attendant brings out cool white towels and a basket with grapes, bananas and oranges. Almond Joy and Baby Ruth candy bars are displayed on a table near a row of magazines in white binders. I put a box of M&Ms with a presidential seal in my bag. Two cameramen watch golf on television.

It also cuts you off from the world - and shows the cloistered nature of the one he inhabits. Mr Obama has to stoop slightly when he gets on board the helicopter in New York so he doesnt bump his head. Afterwards my colleagues and I head across the tarmac to an Osprey aircraft, propellers spinning. The gusts of air are hot and fierce, and I almost lose my footing. The aircraft shakes in the air, and you can feel it vibrate in your throat. I see a red buoy in churning water, like a fragment from a Turner painting, and we fly over South Street Seaport. FDR Drive on the east side of Manhattan is closed down for our motorcade. Traffic is blocked for miles. ""Wave like the queen,"" a friend in Boston had advised me. Police line the streets on the Upper East Side, where Mr Obama attends a Democratic fundraiser. Nearby a mailbox has a padlock and a red sign: ""This collection box has been locked."" This makes it harder to stuff it with explosives. Image caption In New York Mr Obama is protected by police officers - and dump trucks In other places, dump trucks block the streets. Gravel is piled in the back of one truck marked ""sanitation"". The following morning the president is chewing gum on a walk near Central Parks Sheep Meadow. ""We love you, Obama,"" someone calls out. Secret Service officers wade through the grass, checking for bombs and assassins. Afterwards Mr Obama goes to a Broadway play. A worker from a nearby French restaurant says they closed for a couple hours because of the security. ""Not a big deal,"" he says, adding they havent lost much business. ""One or two tables."" A lanky man named Michael, whos carrying an iced coffee, walks up. A police officer stops him. ""Im trying to get to a place upstairs,"" Michael says. ""An AA meeting,"" he tells me, referring to Alcoholics Anonymous, afterwards. ""I happen to be in the wrong place at the right time,"" he says. Like others in New York, he takes it in his stride.

Teacher Steven Watt struck off for drunken behaviour at music camp,A primary teacher is struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.,,13 May 2013,BBC News,"A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil. Steven Watt, 41, was employed by Angus Council at the time of the incident in October 2011. At a General Teaching Council hearing, he admitted charges including being intoxicated while caring for children. A panel determined Watts behaviour fell ""significantly short of the standards expected of a registered teacher"" and deemed him unfit to teach. The complaint to the General Teaching Council for Scotland related to incidents during a music band camp on the evening of 28 October and the next morning. Alcohol problem The panel heard Watt engaged in conversation and made remarks to a number of children in his care which were ""inappropriate and offensive"". He suggested to a number of male pupils in a dormitory that he was conducting a survey. He then asked one pupil if he was ""camp"" and told him ""it was okay to be gay these days"". The teacher then stroked the same pupils arm and got into his bed. A further charge said he later drove a vehicle while ""intoxicated by alcohol or some other substance"". Parts of the hearing were held in private in order to protect the identity of the children involved. Watt told the panel he had suffered from an alcohol problem for much of his life but following the incident at the music camp he was now attending Alcoholics Anonymous. He said he not had an alcoholic drink for more than a year. Watt said he missed teaching and that he would like to return to the profession. The teaching council told Watt a period of two years would have to pass before he could apply to re-register with the council. The panel also suggested his name be referred to Scottish ministers under the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007.",{},"['suggested', 'teacher', 'council', 'panel', 'scotland', 'steven', 'watt', 'music', 'told', 'camp', 'teaching', 'struck', 'drunken', 'behaviour']","A primary teacher has been struck off after getting drunk at a music camp and climbing into the bed of a male pupil.

Eight unhelpful things to say to an alcoholic,It's painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction.,,None,,"Its painful to see someone you love struggle with alcohol addiction. And its easy to get angry about how their behaviour is affecting the people around them. But if you want to help, you need to know the right things to say. Newsbeat asked three recovering alcoholics to explain what didnt help them, and what they wish their families had said. 1. Why do you need to drink? ""At first Id say, Because I like it,"" Tracey says. Her husband had just left the family and she thought alcohol was helping her numb the pain. But when her children asked her why she was drinking, she became resentful. She says as a result she even increased the amount she was drinking. ""They were trying to be helpful but to me they werent because I was in denial."" But as time went on, she became scared of the addiction. ""I got more open because I was frightened, and I could say, I dont know how to stop any more. I need help."" She says its important to try to understand the reasons behind someones drinking problem, and try not to be judgemental. 2. Why cant you just stop? Alcoholics can be physically addicted, meaning their body has come to rely on alcohol to feel ""normal"". Stopping suddenly can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations and seizures. ""I just couldnt stop. Not at the time. Medically I couldnt,"" says Tracey. ""You can go into fits if you stop just like that."" She was drinking a bottle of vodka a night and would have panic attacks if there was no booze in the house. ""People need to understand its an illness,"" Tracey insists. It can take between three months and a year to fully recover from the effects of alcohol withdrawal. Tracey managed to quit because her family took her to the GP. She spent time in hospital and was put on medication to help. 3. Youre selfish As families grow tired of an alcoholics drinking, they can often start to criticise them more aggressively. This made Traceys behaviour more spiteful, she says. ""I was selfish,"" says Tracey. ""But at the time I couldnt see that. ""Its dreadful to think thats what I used to do. I should have been coming home and thinking, What am I going to cook [my daughter] for tea? ""But all my mind was fixated on was coming home to have a drink."" Ambrose, whos been off alcohol for nine months, says: ""I could see I was hurting and upsetting people. ""I couldnt cope with feeling guilty so I ended up drinking more to forget that I felt guilty."" Tracey says its best to avoid using combative language if youre trying to help someone with an alcohol problem. Instead, try to be sympathetic. ""I just wanted them to say, Look Mum, we know youve got a problem. Were here to help you."" 4. Dont you love us? Tracey says her children asked her this often. ""I thought, What a horrible thing to say. ""I knew I did love them. Why would it change because Ive had a drink? ""But obviously I wasnt showing them."" For Rose, who stopped drinking three years ago, it was ""nothing to do with love"". ""If I was able to have stopped of course I would have. ""It wasnt a choice. It was a necessity,"" she says. 5. How are you able to afford this? ""If I had no electricity Id ask my mum for help to pay for more,"" remembers Rose. ""And sometimes shed say, Oh - but you can afford drink. ""Unfortunately she was probably right. But it doesnt help."" 6. Shouting and screaming ""Get yourself together"" and ""youre a mother for Gods sake."" Rose remembers these words being shouted at her but she says she only had time to reflect once the shouting stopped. ""There was silence and it gave me room to think. ""Calmly people said to me, Were so worried about you. Youre going to die. We dont know what to do. ""I wanted to die in my sleep. I couldnt see how I could ever stop drinking. ""But the silence let me see the pain my family were going through."" 7. We wont drink either Rose finds it patronising when she goes for dinner with friends and someone says something like, ""none of us are going to drink either"". ""They make a huge deal about them not having alcohol. Actually it makes me feel uncomfortable. ""Id much rather they said something like, Oh, do you mind if I have a drink? ""When people are being obviously super careful it can be difficult."" Tracey still goes to the pub with her friends but she says she would never expect them not to drink on her behalf. 8. Are you strong enough? Since he stopped drinking Ambrose says he dislikes when people ask if hes strong enough to stay off it. ""When they ask that I think, Cheers mate, thanks for having faith in me."" He understands history may have taught people recovery can occasionally have setbacks but he says: ""Its people having negative thoughts and passing them on to me. ""It puts a negative thought in my head and I start to wonder if Im kidding myself."" Links to advice and help You can get advice about alcohol on the BBC Advice pages. Support groups and helplines are offered by a number of organisations in the UK including Al-Anon (linked to the Alcoholics Anonymous organisation) and DrugFam.

Play centre founder admits filming girls in changing rooms,"Married father-of-two Darren Johnson ""stalked"" girls changing after swimming lessons.",,28 August 2018,BBC News,"Image copyright Metropolitan Police/PA Wire Image caption Married father-of-two Darren Johnson filmed girls getting changed after swimming lessons The co-founder of a childrens play centre filmed youngsters undressing after swimming lessons, a court heard. Former Eddie Catz director Darren Johnson used ""peepholes"" to film women and girls in toilets and changing rooms at a leisure centre for children. The number of victims is not known, but a police officer involved in the case estimated it may be as many as 40. Johnson, 51, from Putney, south-west London, admitted five counts of voyeurism over a 12-year period. He was caught when two 14-year-old girls spotted his camera-phone from under the cubicle adjacent to them and alerted staff, Kingston Crown Court heard. Stalked children After Johnson was identified in CCTV footage, police seized two computers containing hundreds of images of women in various states of undress. Johnson admitted voyeurism between 1 January 2005 and 5 June 2017. Two of the charges relate to filming the 14-year-old girls, while a third relates to images of women taken under cubicles at a leisure centre. Two more charges relate to images of women taken through ""peepholes"" in toilets and changing rooms at an Eddie Catz soft play centre. His defence lawyer claimed Johnson had not meant to film teenagers. However, prosecutor Lauren Sales said CCTV shows Johnson ""stalking children around the leisure centre"". ""He attended the leisure centre at times when schools have swim classes,"" she added. ""He goes up to the swimming pool, sees the kids, sees them using the facilities, stalks them to the shower area... and uses the cubicle next to them.""

The company has centres in Earlsfield, Putney, Wimbledon and Newbury, as well as a presence in branches of Mothercare in Leeds, Gateshead, Manchester, Solihull and Bristol. Defence lawyer Tom Williams said Johnson was plagued by alcohol problems and marriage troubles. ""He is truly sorry for what he has done and has done everything he can to address those things in his life which pushed him into an extremely dark place in that period,"" Mr Williams said. Johnson has attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and classes for sex addicts since his arrest, the court heard.

"John McAfee: Addict, coder, runaway","John McAfee speaks to the BBC about his time on the run after his neighbour was found murdered, his addiction to drugs and why he thinks Silicon Valley needs a shake-up.",,11 October 2013,BBC News,"Who is the real John McAfee? Hes the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. Hes the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet. Within tech circles hes long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had ""no connection whatsoever"" with his neighbours death. Police say he remains a ""person of interest"". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female ""friends"" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSAs cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a ""master manipulator"" who lies and deceives. Image caption John McAfee returned to the US last December after being released from a Guatemalan jail ""Ive been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley,"" McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: ""Im an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. ""I think that its when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldnt look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. ""Were missing that. Were missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see whats there."" This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: ""Hes sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. Hes serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. Hes generally a sweet guy. He just doesnt like to be [expletive] with."" So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-olds past. Addicted and expelled Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. When she tried to shoot me in the head, what I saw was a frightened child. Im deaf in one ear now, but I dont have a bullet in my head John McAfee ""I feel as much British as I do American,"" McAfee says. ""Theres not much difference between our countries."" They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. Image caption John McAfee played up to his bad boy reputation in a video he uploaded in June ""Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind,"" he says. ""I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. ""I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in peoples offices. It was a bizarre time."" Image caption McAfee says he has never used anti-virus software Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. ""It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter,"" he says. ""I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. ""However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And Im afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. Thats why people think, perhaps, Im a little bit off the wall."" Anti-virus millionaire Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: ""Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS."" ""When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, Id never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology,"" remembers McAfee. ""It fascinated me."" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John McAfee speaks to Leo Kelion about his life and why he fled from the police in Belize He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). ""I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers,"" he says. ""Theres always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you. Someone who thinks youre a hero and some that think youre a villain John McAfee ""Its why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. ""So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could."" Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. ""Im constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. ""I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. ""Porn sites, for example, I just dont go there. ""Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, Im not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. ""It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone elses software."" Image caption John McAfee says he has not taken drugs or drunk alcohol for nearly three decades After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in ""trikes"" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. Research and raid In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. ""I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. ""Up until about 10 years ago we didnt even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics."" He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the countrys Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didnt go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police forces Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. ""Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab,"" he states. ""Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. Image caption McAfees Quorumex project attempted to create new treatments using plants from Belizes jungles ""Its a pirate haven. Its an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. ""I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. ""I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound."" McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the ""barbaric assault"" on McAfee was a ""global black eye"" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. ""I do wish that I were smarter socially,"" reflects McAfee. ""I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive."" Image caption Amy Emshwiller moved with John McAfee to the Caribbean town of San Pedro At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. ""I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me,"" remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. ""[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me."" She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. ""He didnt know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. I didnt quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns Chad Essley, Graphic novelist ""I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. ""When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didnt know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: I still love you, I dont know what to do. Im in love with a young girl. Thats how that happened."" McAfees long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfees gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. ""Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it,"" McAfee explains. ""Of course shes not going to be well. Of course shes going to have issues. ""When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. Image caption After the raid on his Carmelita property, McAfee moved to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye island ""What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. ""What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesnt help her. ""All she did was burst my eardrum. Im deaf in one ear now, but I dont have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?"" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. ""One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat,"" she says. ""And he just said: Go ahead. Kill me. And I couldnt do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out."" Image caption Cartoonist Chad Essley is working on a graphic novel about McAfee which is due for release next year Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belizes biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfees life. ""I didnt quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns,"" he says. ""Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. ""It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didnt want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. ""I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John."" Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbours activities. Hatchet buried On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: ""Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more."" That night the local TV bulletin declared that ""the hatchet was formally buried"", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belizes authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. Image caption Gregory Faull was found shot dead at his home in Belize The head of the polices Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faulls murder, and now he feared for his own life. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me, he says. ""The government does from time to time. ""I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. ""Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said thats absurd. At the time I did not think so."" McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwillers dogs a poisoned tortilla. ""The entire five years I was there, Id said maybe 15 words to him,"" he says. ""He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. ""There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as Im beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that."" Image caption John McAfee dyed his hair black as part of one of his disguises In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfees dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had ""terrified"" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property ""at all hours"", causing a disturbance. ""I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States,"" says McAfee when pressed about this. ""Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer."" Hiding out McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be ""silenced"" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldnt be made to disappear if he had been caught. Image caption Prime Minister Dean Barrow said it was ""utter and complete nonsense"" that the police wanted to kill McAfee ""I disguised myself as a ragged salesman,"" he recalls. ""All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. ""You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that."" Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belizes prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a ""person of interest"". ""I dont want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers,"" the politician added. Belize and corruption The BBC put Mr McAfees claims of corruption to the Belize government, which is currently embroiled in a scandal involving the issue of a passport to a South Korean man who had never visited the country. It sent this reply: Belize has made great strides in improving transparency and ethical behaviour across all government departments. Where any sniff of corruption and evidence of such has been proven, the prime minister and the government have moved swiftly to stamp it out. This has most recently been demonstrated by the sacking of the junior minister of immigration. The US government and the Commonwealth have been instrumental in supporting Belize in addressing governance issues as we work to reduce even the appearance of fraud and corruption. Corruption is a cancer that Belize will continue to correct - it has no place in government or in any public office and we do not and will not tolerate it. The past is the past and this Belize government cannot change the behaviour of previous administrations or officials, but the prime minister has vowed to root out corruption wherever and whenever it occurs. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. ""When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: Come to this place, or go there, she recalls. ""How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me."" She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfees life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. ""I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation,"" remembers McAfee. ""We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-ones real fault. It was just the fault of the moment."" A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. ""After it was over I asked myself, Good Lord, I must have been afraid,"" he says. ""But I really cant remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred."" Hero and villain McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faulls death, but says an attempt to contact the victims family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a ""hollow gesture"" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. Image caption John McAfee continued to give interviews even when being held by the Guatemalan authorities A spokesman for the countrys government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. ""Mr McAfees claims and his behaviour have been extreme,"" he told the BBC. ""The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize."" So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. ""Theres always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you,"" he says. ""Someone who thinks youre a hero and some that think youre a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that Im totally innocent."" That doesnt mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. ""If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it,"" he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in peoples pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners devices within a three-block radius. Image caption John McAfee is working with a Canadian company to make a documentary about his life He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. Hes also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowdens leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. ""You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can,"" he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfees life, its impossible to be sure of all the facts and its ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word.",{},"['im', 'caption', 'mcafees', 'mcafee', 'belize', 'came', 'coder', 'later', 'john', 'runaway', 'addict', 'head', 'going']","Who is the real John McAfee?

Alcohol dependency: When social drinking becomes a problem,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event, but turn into dependency and addiction, experts say.",,15 December 2012,BBC News,"Alcohol-related health issues among baby boomers are on the rise. Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say. So when does social drinking become alcoholism? In the festive season, with office parties, Christmas, and new year, there is opportunity aplenty for yet another tipple. Since the 1950s, alcohol consumption in the UK has gradually increased. The NHS now spends more on alcohol-related illness among baby boomers than any other age group, with £825m spent on 55 to 74-year-olds in 2010-11 compared to £64m on under-24s. Alcohol addiction When someone becomes dependent or addicted to alcohol, they: Develop a strong sense of compulsion to drink May drink shortly after waking to reduce feelings of alcohol withdrawal Develop a reduced capacity to control how often and how much they drink Organise their lifestyle around drinking Continue to drink despite physical or social problems Source: BBC Health The long-term effects of alcohol Estimates also suggest about nine per cent of men and three per cent of women in the UK show signs of alcohol dependence. But it is the functioning alcoholic that can slip under the radar - before their health issues are severe enough to need treatment. Straight vodka Dr John Marsden, an alcohol and drug dependency expert from Kings College London, says a typical functioning alcoholic can manage to hold down a job despite having a ""very severe drinking problem that they have been incubating over a very long period"". ""Alcohol problems are difficult to understand because they do not occur overnight. They are hidden from view which makes functioning alcoholics a group we cannot easily help."" Rob C, who is 61, was one of them. At his worst he was drinking 1.5 litres of straight vodka per day. ""Then I began to suffer blackouts, losing whole days and not remembering anything."" He would be first to arrive at work, which made him able to set out his ""drinks for the day with what looked like a bottle of mineral water"". ""I would hide bottles around the office. You think nobody else knows, that it doesnt smell, that youre getting away with it. But of course they did notice."" Life saver For several years, maintaining a full-time finance job, he drank increasingly more during the day. There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that Dr John Marsden, Addiction expert What started as a social pastime nearly cost him his relationship. Now sober for eight years, looking back he says that even if a colleague had said something at the time, he would not have listened. ""I resented the changes at work and told myself I deserved a drink. I would buy wine at lunchtime and drink it from a polystyrene cup."" Wine turned to vodka for a ""bigger kick"" and lunchtime turned to morning through to night. Early retirement on medical grounds made his addiction worse. It was only when his partner threatened to kick him out that he sought help with Alcoholics Anonymous, who he says saved his life. Rob is not alone. In the last decade there has been a 63% increase in prescriptions for the treatment of alcohol dependency in England, as well as a 20% rise in deaths from liver disease. Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, a liver specialist and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, believes the number of people dying from liver disease will keep rising. The majority of people who have alcohol-related health problems are middle-aged, which Sir Ian says is a consequence of chronic alcohol misuse - many years of frequent heavy drinking, rather than binge drinking - a session of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a small space of time. But he says that though there is a big overlap, it is important to remember not all heavy social drinkers are dependent on alcohol. ""Some people can control their drinking after work, others cant. If people are frequently drinking harmful levels of alcohol - over 50 units a week for men, 35 for women - most will end up suffering some form of physical, mental or social harm."" A lifetimes worth of drinking is catching up with baby boomers, says Emily Robinson from the Alcohol Concern. The charity hopes that their campaign, Dry January, will help get people thinking about how much they drink, especially at home when units are harder to measure, and crucially, before they reach a stage where drinking is affecting their health. ""The issue of people drinking every day is worrying as its a way of slipping into dependency, as you need to drink a little more each time to feel the same effects,"" she says. Dr Marsden suggests the line between social drinking and dependency is clear. He says the first question that needs to be asked by clinicians or family members is: ""Has anyone expressed concern to you about your drinking?"" Whats a unit? Half a pint of standard strength (4%) beer, cider or lager A single pub measure of spirit (25ml) Half a standard glass of wine (175ml) Alcohol units guide This question assesses whether a persons behaviour has negatively impacted on someone close to them, he adds. ""If your alcohol consumption has caused a problem for someone else - Im not rushing to label you an alcoholic but suggesting you need to take a closer look at your behaviour."" There is a clear reason the baby boomer generation is now most at risk from alcohol-related problems, argues Dr Marsden. A hard-working generation led to an appetite for entertainment and relaxation. ""There was work, there was money and increasingly the motivation to alter ones mood quickly. Alcohol has been the drug of choice to do that.""",{},"['problems', 'dependency', 'work', 'baby', 'alcoholrelated', 'health', 'alcohol', 'drinking', 'problem', 'drink', 'social']","Daily drinking can start off as a social event but turn into dependency, addiction experts say.

Jay-Z and Meek Mill pledge $50m to free prisoners,"The rappers aim to free one million people who they say are ""trapped in the system"".",,24 January 2019,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jay-Z and Meek Mill have partnered with the owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, among others, to launch the Reform Alliance Jay-Z, Meek Mill and sport and business leaders have pledged $50m (£38m) to reform the US criminal justice system. The Reform Alliance, which was inspired by Meek Mills recent stint in prison for a minor probation violation, hopes to free one million prisoners in five years. The owners of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia 76ers, Robert Kraft and Michael Rubin, are co-founders. Reform says it wants to help people who are ""trapped in the system"". The groups ""mission"" is to ""dramatically reduce the number of people who are unjustly under the control of the criminal justice system, starting with probation and parole"". ""To win, we will leverage our considerable resources to change laws, policies, hearts and minds,"" it says. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Reform founders: Jay-Z with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, the 76ers Michael Rubin, Meek Mill, Michael Novogratz, Clara Wu Tsai, Daniel Loeb and the groups CEO Van Jones More than six million people can currently count themselves as part of the ""correctional population"" of the USA - which includes people in prisons and local jails, but is mostly made up of the more than four million people on probation or parole, according to Bureau of Justice statistics. Probation is often given as a sentence instead of time in prison and can include conditions like being on a curfew or going to rehab. Parole is when an inmate is released early from prison with similar conditions to probation. Meek Mill has experienced all three: probation, parole and jail. The Reform Alliance says his case is an example of the ""devastating and long-lasting effects"" that can occur after one interaction with the criminal justice system. The rapper was arrested in 2007 - he says wrongfully - for drug and gun charges, aged 19. He was sentenced in 2009 to between 11 and 23 months in county prison, but was released on parole after five months and put on house arrest. It was during this time he started to make his name nationally as a rapper, signing to Rick Rosss label and releasing a string of hugely successful mixtapes. Before long he was a platinum-selling artist. But a parole violation for suspected cannabis use resulted in a ban on touring, and then after failing to get his travel plans approved by the court Meek was sentenced to prison again in 2014. Examples of parole violations that can land people back in prison range from being late to appointments with parole officers or missing a curfew, to things more specific to the crime that was committed - like failing to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. ""When you talk about these so-called technical violations, its not technical to the kid who can never see her mum again because she showed up late for a meeting. Thats not technical, thats devastating for that individual child,"" Reform Alliance CEO Van Jones said. Violations over the next few years resulted in his probation period being extended - it now lasts up until 2023 - as well as the five months in prison which ended in April 2018 and birthed the #FreeMeek movement. Its people with a similar story to Meeks, that have been ""caught up on probation and parole"", that Reform says it wants to focus on first. If someone commits a crime they should go to jail ""Being from the environment Im from, I dont even think its possible for you to be an angel,"" Meek said as the organisation was announced in New York. ""You grow up around murder on a daily basis, you grow up in drug-infested neighbourhoods. ""And every time I started to further my life with the music industry, there was always something that brought me back to ground zero,"" he said. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who attended the event, said he was a supporter of criminal justice reforms that are ""fair, help our system work better and smarter, and save crucial taxpayer dollars while balancing public safety and victim concerns"". Across the US, roughly a third of people on parole are black, according to Bureau of Justice statistics - something Jay-Z raised at the event. ""We want to be very clear. If someone commits a crime they should go to jail. But these things are just disproportionate and the whole world knows it,"" he said. Jay-Z has been vocal about Meeks case, writing in the New York Times while he was imprisoned. ""On the surface, this may look like the story of yet another criminal rapper who didnt smarten up and is back where he started,"" he wrote. ""Whats happening to Meek Mill is just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day. ""I saw this up close when I was growing up in Brooklyn during the 1970s and 1980s. Instead of a second chance, probation ends up being a land mine, with a random misstep bringing consequences greater than the crime.

Michael Le Vell: Street star's 'demons' laid bare in trial,"Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell is cleared of child sex offences, but his trial revealed the darker side of his personal life.",,10 September 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Michael Le Vell was described in court as a ""heavy drinker [who] went out most nights"" Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has been cleared of child sex abuse offences after a trial at Manchester Crown Court that lasted more than a week. On the steps of the court, after the jury had found him not guilty of 12 charges, his relief was obvious. ""I might go and have a drink now, believe it or not,"" was how Mr Le Vell finished his brief statement to the gathered media. It was a remark that raised a laugh with his supporters but, as had been clear in the trial, it pointed to a dark side of the stars private life. The 48-year-old actor, tried under his real name Michael Turner, had confessed his inner demons - alcoholism and adultery - during his time in the witness box. Troubled life The indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? Nigel Pivaro, Ex-Coronation Street actor However, the star who plays Kevin Webster in the ITV soap maintained throughout he had never sexually assaulted or raped a child. The judge had warned jurors not to confuse the man in the dock with his TV role as the car mechanic he has played for 30 years, watched by nine million viewers a week. Mr Le Vell told the court his role had allowed him to live a ""luxury, charmed"" existence, but that on-screen fame hid what prosecutors said was a ""troubled"" life. During cross-examination, he admitted he was an alcoholic and for 30 years had been ""drinking about seven or eight pints a night"" in the pub. He told the court he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous ""one or two times"" but had given up on each occasion after just a few weeks. In court, Mr Le Vell claimed his drinking was the result of his ""working-class mentality"" and confessed he had only been able to continue acting because his job had ""cocooned"" him. One-night stands The verdict came at the end of a trial which had seen the prosecutor remind the jury the case concerned neither Coronation Streets Kevin Webster nor Michael Le Vell. Image caption Mr Le Vell has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the popular soap since 1983 ""The man on trial is Michael Turner,"" chief prosecutor Eleanor Laws QC said. During his trial, the jury heard how Mr Le Vell had cheated on his wife while she was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer, in a parallel with his on-screen character, and he had had a string of one-night stands. By coincidence, his character Kevin Webster had an affair with a character called Molly Dobbs while his on-screen wife, Sally Webster, developed breast cancer. Such plot developments came a long time after Mr Turner started acting at school, aged 12, later becoming a member of Oldham Theatre Workshop, adopting the stage name of Le Vell along the way. In 1981, he got his break, joining Coronation Street in a minor role for a few episodes. Two years later, he was cast as mechanic Kevin Webster. As producers sought to win younger audiences Kevin and his two mates - bad-boy Terry Duckworth (played by Nigel Pivaro) and dreamer with intellectual pretensions Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy) became a hit with fans. Stars personal drama Only Mr Le Vell has lasted in ""The Street"" and fans of the soap opera have followed his stormy relationship with Sally, played by Sally Dynevor. Image caption Mr Le Vells trial lasted seven days and ended with his acquittal on all charges Such was his prominence, he had a major part in 2010s live 50th anniversary episode, which featured a fatal tram crash in Weatherfield, with his performance leading to a Best Actor nomination at the 2011 British Soap Awards. Within months of that on-screen drama though, Mr Le Vell was dealing with his own crisis as he was arrested over child sex allegations. He ""strenuously"" denied the claims and, after considering the case, the Crown Prosecution Service made the decision not to bring charges against him, in January 2012. At the time, Mr Le Vell praised Greater Manchester Police for a ""fair, thorough and independent investigation"", adding that he was ""delighted to be completely exonerated"" by the decision to take no further action. A year later however, the principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions overturned the decision and brought a prosecution case against him. Hes been exonerated Again, Mr Le Vell denied the accusations and said they were ""an absolute pack of lies"" which he would ""fight vigorously"". During the trial, the prosecution put it to Mr Le Vell his witness box performance was just an act. But a jury of eight women and four men did not believe he was acting and the actor left the court a free man. His on-screen and off-screen friend Mr Pivaro sees no reason why Mr Le Vell cannot resume his Coronation Street career. ""I think the indication is clear that he is going back to Coronation Street and why not? Hes been exonerated,"" said Mr Pivaro.

The actor - one of Americas highest-paid stars - was taken to hospital in Los Angeles with severe abdominal pains late last month before entering rehab. He filed for divorce from his third wife, Brooke Mueller, in November, citing irreconcilable differences. In late October 2009, Sheen was accused of causing damage to a hotel room in New York.

Though her partner enjoyed the attention at first, it became insurmountable for the couple. ""At first he was fine with it but towards the end he couldnt understand it at all. After a few months he started to raise questions about why and where it was coming from. ""He accused me of having an affair - he thought I must have been feeling guilty about it and thats why I wanted sex with him."" In November 2014, Ms Barker ""needed a break"" from the relationship and went to stay with her mother. ""When I left, I told my partner I needed to get better. He let me go, then the relationship broke down very quickly after that. ""I was under the care of a psychiatrist at the time - she kept saying she would alter my medication but she never said there were any support groups or anything."" Ms Barker was diagnosed with depression in 2012 after the birth of her third child. She said after it intensified in 2014 she changed jobs, split up with her partner and moved to France. ""I made many lifestyle changes in order to get over the depression and the addiction and for me that has worked,"" she said. What is sex addiction?

The 43-year-old Tyneside-born former England midfielder was stopped by police in Newcastle on 8 October. The citys magistrates court was told that Gascoigne was more than four times the legal alcohol limit. He was handed an eight-week sentence, suspended for a year, and banned from driving for three years. He was also given an alcohol treatment order. The court was told Gascoigne was five weeks into a 12-week anti-drink programme in Dorset.

Shot Chelsea lawyer Mark Saunders 'asked for his wife',The widow of a barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off tells an inquest she could have defused the situation.,,20 September 2010,BBC News,"Image caption Mr Saunders family say he posed no real risk to the public The widow of an alcoholic barrister who was shot dead by police during a stand-off told an inquest she could have defused the situation. Mark Saunders, 32, was hit in the head and chest by five police bullets at his Chelsea home in May 2008. Elizabeth Saunders told Westminster Coroners Court: ""I know that Mark would never, ever have hurt me."" Mr Saunders asked negotiators if he could speak to his wife, but she said police told her to turn her phone off. Mrs Saunders, also a barrister at QEB chambers, said that her husband told their senior clerk he had been ""firing his gun and that the police were coming and he was in trouble"" in a phone call shortly before 1700 BST. Blank text She made her way home but was stopped at the police cordon. Officers then asked her to switch off her mobile phone. She said she heard a ""lot of commotion"" but did not know her husband was dead until 2230 BST. Later when she switched on her phone, she found a blank text from him. Image caption Mark Saunders family say he posed no risk to the public Mrs Saunders said: ""That would have been the only time in our relationship that he sent me a text message and he did not get an immediate call from me saying, Darling, I am here. ""That is very difficult for me, but there it is. I did not know he had called."" She told the inquest: ""The truth of our relationship was Mark and I loved each other. ""I think he would have just said Darling, I am sorry. And I would have said Sweetheart, it is OK. Do not worry, we will sort this out."" The inquest also heard that Mr Saunders had texted Alex Booth, the best man at his wedding, during the stand-off. The message said: ""This is the end, my only friend, the end."" Mr Booth told the court they would often quote films and music to each other, and the message appeared to be quoting from a song by The Doors used in the film Apocalypse Now. The hearing was told Mr Saunders had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous and sought help from his GP to control his drinking. The family law expert had been prescribed anti-depressants and had also taken cocaine in the months leading up to his death. Love for life Mrs Saunders said she thought he had been drinking heavily on the day of his killing. She said her husband was a ""very sensitive and caring man"" with ""huge energy and love for life"". Mrs Saunders said he had been teetotal apart from a few ""blips"". She said: ""There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong."" On the day of his death Mr Saunders had been out on various errands and seemed ""very happy"". Cab driver David Hay, who dropped him later in the day, told the inquest: ""He looked straight at me, and just said, Im going to die."" The death of Mr Saunders, who was once in the Territorial Army, was filmed from a police helicopter. Police had been called after neighbours saw him firing a shotgun into a neighbouring flat. The officers say they were firing in self-defence, or to protect others. None of them is to be prosecuted, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.

Here is the latest in the series: Most recovering alcoholics talk about the moment they hit rock bottom. Warning signs Image copyright Getty Images In their book Almost Alcoholic, Robert Doyle and Joseph Nowinski identify five signs that someone may be an ""almost alcoholic"": You continue to drink despite at least some negative consequences You look forward to drinking. You drink alone. You sometimes drink in order to control emotional and/or physical symptoms. You and your loved ones are suffering as a result of your drinking For Jan, it was when she spent a year in prison for grievous bodily harm after being convicted of glassing a woman in an Alderley Edge bar. The Stockport mother, who did not want to be identified in order to protect her daughter, says cannot remember anything of the 2008 incident. At that time Jan was drinking about two bottles of wine a night. Before then, she says she drank sensibly, in order to wind down from her job as a senior executive for a major oil company. ""I used alcohol as an emotional crutch,"" Jan explained. ""It started off as just a glass of wine after work and it turned into two bottles. ""Id have cleaned a whole football stadium with a toothbrush if it would tell me why this was happening to me at the age of 40."" Before being sent to prison she sought treatment for her alcoholism at a private clinic, and was sober when she was behind bars. While serving her sentence at HMP Styal in Cheshire she helped others who were struggling to cope with life in prison and, as a result, gained a great deal of respect from other inmates. And since her release she has been helping others battle addiction in Greater Manchester, saying she ""now has a better understanding of herself"". ""And I NEVER think of having a drink.""

Christopher and Robert Abraham, aged 26 and 20, attacked local football referee David Linning, 65, at his home in East Kilbride in Lanarkshire last December. The assault happened after they received a text from their mother, who was in a relationship with Mr Linning, saying she had a ""sore face"". The brothers later learned she had tripped and fallen while drunk. Mr Linning was punched, kicked and slashed on the face with a knife during the attack. His body was not found until two days later when a friend came to collect him to referee a football match in the town. The brothers, who are the sons of former Radio Clyde presenter Mr Abie, were sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh. He was so helpful he was trying to help the two guys who killed him to get off the drink Billy Linning, Victims son They had earlier admitted a charge of culpable homicide. Judge Lady Stacey told them: ""What you did that day was wicked. ""You went to the home of a man in his 60s when you were both fuelled by drink and, as you well know, drink is no excuse. ""You then proceeded to attack him. Two young men attacking an older man."" Lady Stacey noted that both Abraham brothers had expressed remorse but added: ""No remorse you can now express can do anything to take away the anguish that Mr Linnings family - his large family - must feel because of what you did."" Speaking after the sentencing Mr Linnings son Billy, 37, said the family was relieved the case was over. Well-known figure He added: ""We would just like to say we are very happy with the outcome. ""It has been absolutely horrific. No two days are the same for any of us. Everyone is totally devastated and will be for many many years to come.""

Living in the grip of alcohol,Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has started drinking again. How difficult is it to fight alcohol addiction?,,4 February 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Paul Gascoigne has an ongoing battle with alcohol Concerns are growing for former England footballer Paul Gascoigne who has been struggling with an addiction to alcohol. The 45-year-old was shaking and slurred his words on stage at a charity event in Northampton on Thursday and his agent, Terry Baker, says he now fears for Gascoignes life. Alex Best, widow of football legend and recovering alcoholic George Best who died in 2005, is also concerned. She told The Sun newspaper: ""Seeing Gazza in such a bad way brings back the most horrible memories of George when he was in the grip of the drink that eventually killed him. ""Its heartbreaking to see Paul so deeply gripped by his addiction again."" Relapse can be part of recovery. Thats when they really learn to move on. Ive worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end Julie Rogers, Substance misuse manager Dependency NHS figures suggest nine in every 100 men and four in every 100 women show signs of alcohol dependence. Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day. You dont necessarily have to be rolling around drunk to have a dependency on alcohol - people may be able to hold down a career and drink in a way that is damaging. Dependency mean you are physically and psychologically tied to booze - you feel compelled to drink and this takes its toll on your physical and emotional health. Julie Rogers has been working in the addiction field for 12 years, helping people who are hooked on alcohol. Ms Rogers, who works with the charity Foundation 66, says problem drinking is a complex and incredibly difficult behaviour to break. No two people are the same and there is no single approach that is guaranteed to work. ""Alcohol addiction does not have any boundaries. It affects all types of people alike. It doesnt matter if you are wealthy or poor. Warning signs of alcohol dependence Worrying about where your next drink is coming from and planning social, family and work events around alcohol Finding you have a compulsive need to drink and finding it hard to stop once you start Waking up and drinking - or feeling the need to have a drink in the morning Suffering from withdrawal symptoms, such as sweating, shaking and nausea, which stop once you drink alcohol ""And there are so many different reasons why people drink. But the thing they do have in common is that, for them, alcohol has become more than just a drink. ""It becomes something that you need to do to cope and get through. Thats when it becomes a problem."" For some, the trigger is stress or anxiety - a demanding job or a traumatic divorce, for example. She said for others it is a learned behaviour - something they have been exposed to during their childhood and have grown up to follow the same path. Genetics can also make some people susceptible, experts suspect. Breaking the cycle Regardless of the cause, the first step to tackling addiction is the same. Ms Rogers said: ""Recognising you have a problem and then seeking help is the first step. ""It sounds simple but, in reality its not. It can be hard to admit you have a problem and actually do something about it."" The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Lazio player has tried hard to fight his addiction, spending repeated spells in rehab over the last decade. Alcohol harms Short term health risks include alcohol poisoning and accidents and injuries Long term health consequences include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, liver disease (which can cause jaundice), pancreatitis and certain cancers Drinking too much can also affect your relationships and your ability to hold down a job It can lead to anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings Gazzas drinking problems started during his playing days. In 1998, shortly after his divorce from wife Sheryl, he was admitted to the The Priory Hospital in Marchwood, near Southampton, to receive treatment for stress and drink problems. In 2001, whilst playing at Everton, Gascoigne admitted himself to an alcohol rehabilitation clinic in Arizona on the insistence of his then manager Walter Smith. Four years after retiring, in 2008, he was arrested in Newcastle and detained under the Mental Health Act and was later sectioned following reports that he was acting strangely in Hemel Hempstead. More recently he has been treated at The Priory again and the Providence Projects treatment centre in Bournemouth. Ms Rogers says relapses are incredibly common, and they shouldnt be seen as a failure. ""Its important that we do not judge relapse because that just compounds the shame and guilt people feel about it. Dennis story I took my first drink in my early teens. There were consequences from my drinking from the beginning, very small at first: arguing with friends, turning up late for social appointments, losing keys, urinating in alleyways, and general behaviours I would not engage in when I wasnt drinking. As I reached my 20s I had destroyed a marriage by now, and I was well on that alcoholic slippery downhill slope. I was starting to lose jobs as I could not be trusted to turn up for work. Into my 30s, my drinking very subtly but progressively got worse; the dry spells between my binges got shorter and shorter. I had started too waken up in strange places and also in A&E hospitals and couldnt remember how I got there. The last 10 years of my drinking, I had tried many avenues of escape in order to stop drinking completely and failed every single time. At 40 years old I was truly beaten by alcohol. I had heard and of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and had visited AA meetings in the past but nothing else, I would visit and then leave and eventually always drink again. I did not know what it was to be an alcoholic, and I had not fully admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic. Now, through AAs 12-step recovery programme, I have a productive, contented life with complete abstinence from alcohol. ""Relapse can be part of recovery. Thats when they really learn to move on. Ive worked with people who have relapsed 20 or 30 times and have got there in the end. ""Even if it is your thousandth relapse, it can still be the last. Its important not to give up."" She said in order to break the cycle some people need to hit a critical point where its ""stop drinking or die"". Help on hand But for others, abstinence is never an option. Instead, they might work towards curbing their intake, even if it means they are still drinking far too much for good health. ""Some people reduce the harm rather than stop drinking. ""Some relapse every few months but still lead a fulfilling life. Even if you get a month of sobriety at least its a month."" She said there is plenty of help available to anyone struggling to keep their drinking under control. ""Your first port of call should be your GP who can direct you to your local alcohol services."" Support may include home-based and community detoxification programmes, counselling and group work. Friends and family also have a role to play. Friend and former England player Alan Shearer has said: ""It wont be easy, but he [Gazza] needs to dig deep and find the energy and the will to do it. ""What he needs to know most of all is that he is loved.""",{},"['living', 'rogers', 'work', 'stop', 'alcoholic', 'need', 'alcohol', 'thats', 'grip', 'drinking', 'addiction', 'drink']","Drinking alcohol becomes a focus in daily life, meaning the person no longer has control over their drinking and depends on it to get through the day.

State must 'go further' to help addicts,"The state should do more to help addicts and make them employable, Iain Duncan Smith says, with removing benefits a ""hypothetical"" option.",,24 May 2012,BBC News,"Image copyright SPL Image caption Some say withdrawing benefits from drug users would lead them into crime The state should intervene further to help drug and alcohol addicts recover and make them employable in future, a senior cabinet minister has said. In a speech to Alcoholics Anonymous, Iain Duncan Smith argued that addicts who are unable to work are being let down by the welfare system. The BBC understands removing benefits from people refusing treatment will be an option but a ""hypothetical"" one. One drug charity said such a move would set a ""dangerous precedent"". In 2010, the Home Office considered plans to remove benefits from addicts who refused treatment as part of the governments drug strategy but these were not pursued. According to the Department for Work and Pensions, 40,000 people claim incapacity benefits - citing alcoholism as their primary condition. Of these, about a third have been claiming for more than a decade. The government also says 80% of the UKs 400,000 ""problem drug users"" are claiming out-of-work benefits. Road to recovery In a speech in Parliament, Mr Duncan Smith said ""the outdated benefits system fails to get people off drugs and put their lives on track"". ""We have started changing how addicts are supported but we must go further to actively take on the devastation that drugs and alcohol can cause. ""We want to do more to encourage and support claimants into rehabilitation for addiction and starting them on the road to recovery and eventually work."" There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery Martin Barnes, DrugScope Mr Duncan Smith said the introduction of a single, consolidated benefit known as Universal Credit from next year - more details of which will be published on Thursday - will simplify the benefits system and provide more financial incentives for employment, helping all claimants. ""Getting people into work and encouraging independence is our ultimate goal,"" he added. ""Universal Credit will put people on a journey towards sustainable recovery so they are better placed to look for work in future."" The BBCs political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Duncan Smith, in his speech, hinted that a lack of willingness to seek help for addictions could lead to a cut in benefits. But a source close to the minister emphasised that the universal credit would make it easier to ""track people through the system"" and ensure they get the help they need. ""Hypothetically people could lose benefits,"" the source told the BBC. ""You do have to have sanctions. But very few people refuse treatment."" No evidence Charities said many addicts were not receiving the support they needed at job centres and through the governments flagship welfare-to-work programme. One of these, DrugScope, said it would be asking ministers to ""clarify"" their position on sanctions for refusing treatment. ""We are surprised and concerned at reports that ministers believe that stopping benefits is an appropriate or effective way of engaging people with drug or alcohol treatment and supporting their recovery,"" said its chief executive Martin Barnes ""If accurate, this would be a reversal of the governments publicly stated position."" It said ministers had dropped plans, proposed by the previous Labour government, to require all those attending job centres to answer questions about possible drug and alcohol use. ""There is no evidence that using the stick of benefit sanctions will help people to positively engage with treatment and support their recovery,"" Mr Barnes added. ""Indeed, the risk is that people will disengage from support services, potentially worsening their dependency and the impacts on their families and communities. Linking benefit to a requirement to undergo treatment would set a dangerous precedent for people with physical or mental health problems."" All those claiming employment and support allowance - which has replaced incapacity benefit - are currently being re-assessed under plans aimed at getting more people into work and reducing the welfare bill.

Rene scours the streets, grasping at discarded wrappers. His movements are fuelled by a tangible pride. It is an unfamiliar emotion for a man whose alcohol addiction has cost him so much. ""I have four children and three ex-wives, but alcohol has finished everything. I dont see them, they dont know where I am, or if I am alive. Now I have only him. He is there for 30 years, when times are good and bad, he is always there,"" he says, referring to his habit. His affectionate gaze travels downwards. It rests on an aluminium can. Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group. It is a private but primarily government-funded company, which helps those struggling to cope due to homelessness, drug abuse or alcoholism. A gas heater emanates warmth; someone hums along to the theme tune from Armageddon. Rene, 52, has just cracked open his third can of the day. It has just gone 11:30 in the morning. Image caption Rene has four children and three ex-wives but now he is devoted to alcohol He is one of 20 alcoholics who have joined this initiative. They arrive at 09:00 and work until 15:00. They take extended breaks for beer, cigarettes and a hot lunch, all provided free of charge. The distinctive aroma of stamppot, a traditional Dutch vegetable stew, wafts through from the kitchen. The air is hazy with smoke and camaraderie; another pop anthem fills the room with nostalgia. ""They like to cook and you see qualities they didnt even know they had,"" says Janet van de Noord, who runs the Rainbow Groups litter project. Cost-effective ""Its quite difficult to get these people off the alcohol completely. We have tried everything else. Now this is the only thing that works. We might not make them better, but we are giving them a better quality of life and its better for the neighbourhood, theyre giving something back to society."" Inside an oversized garden shed, decorated with Ajax football paraphernalia, about 6,000 cans of beer are stacked in crates. The Rainbow Group is reluctant to say exactly how much the Dutch government pays towards the free beer, cautious of generating any negative publicity that might jeopardise their funding. But Ms van de Noord argues it is a cost-effective way to tackle the impact of alcoholism. ""If people are being arrested, it also costs society a lot of money. So this can only be a good thing. I dont see why other countries wouldnt want to do it."" When I asked other Dutch people about the project they all spoke in favour of it. Ten minutes walk from the now litter-free streets lies Amsterdams Oosterpark. Image caption Oosterpark is no longer strewn with litter but some alcoholics have not been persuaded to give up their park benches Fountains propel shimmering bursts of water; leaves create an autumnal collage on the path. This slice of Dutch life is interrupted by a man staggering towards us. ""Mooooi!"" (""beautiful"") he says, greeting us with a sleazy smile. But he quickly makes it clear that he and his friends do not wish to be interviewed. He is one of the remaining alcoholics who have not been persuaded to abandon their park benches. Since the street-cleaning programme started 12 months ago, local police have received fewer reports of stabbings and muggings in the park. And all of the residents we spoke to said they were happy with the government supporting this unconventional approach. Instead of being ostracised by society, the alcoholics needs appear to have been incorporated into the Dutch healthcare system. The Rainbow Group is optimistic their success so far will attract more funding and help them to reach the unreachable. Other cities in the Netherlands are now considering introducing similar schemes. Floor van Bakkum of Amsterdams Jellinek anti-addiction clinic says the project is a good way to deal with ""a very problematic group - its kind of harm reduction"". She likened it to giving carefully monitored methadone or heroin doses to chronic heroin addicts. ""It might help them to do something else with their life. You always have to monitor such a project, so it shouldnt attract new alcoholics - its not an open invitation to drink in Oosterpark."" She said such a scheme would be inappropriate for alcoholics who still live at home and have a job. Unchangeable reality Back on litter duty, Rene tells me about his past life - expensive cars, extensive travel and some details best not shared. But, he insists, he is happier now, with nothing. He detects our incredulity: ""You dont believe me? Trust me, if I could have my life again I would give it all up for this. ""I know he will never expect anything from me or let me down. Now I am free,"" he says, referring to the drink habit. Some might wonder, how free can an addict be? But the founders of this project treat this addiction as an ""unchangeable reality"" and tackle it using the only device that is guaranteed to connect with the patients. ""I come for the beer. If there was no beer then why would I come?"" says Rene. Regardless of their motivations, Rene and his friends are making a positive difference in a community where they were once despised. ""Its true,"" Rene concedes, acknowledging the irony. ""They used to treat us like garbage - and now we are picking up their garbage, we are not the garbage anymore.""",{},"['paid', 'beer', 'dutch', 'litter', 'collecting', 'rene', 'group', 'alcoholics', 'life', 'project', 'streets', 'rainbow', 'amsterdam']","Chronic alcoholics have congregated inside a communal space, commandeered by the Rainbow Group.

Russell Brand takes on Arthur remake,"The BBC's Tom Brook speaks to Russell Brand about taking on the Arthur role made famous by Dudley Moore, along with his co-star Dame Helen Mirren.",,11 April 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Russell Brand plays a rich heir with a penchant for drink in Arthur Comedian turned actor Russell Brand can currently be seen as Arthur, the drunken New York playboy made famous by Dudley Moore in his 1981 romantic comedy. In recent days Brand has been selling the contemporary remake to US journalists, putting the emphasis on its topicality. ""I think Arthur should be regarded as a fairy-tale prince - a person bestowed with wealth at birth,"" he says. ""In this year of the Royal Wedding, how wonderful to see a romantic comedy focused on a prince."" Dame Helen Mirren appears opposite Brand, stepping into the late Sir John Gielguds shoes to play the heirs faithful servant. Yet where Gielgud was Arthurs butler in the original film, Dame Helen plays his nanny. Image caption Dame Helen Mirren (r) co-stars as Arthurs nanny in the film The Oscar-winning actress shares several scenes with the larger-than-life Brand, whom she says was ""utterly disciplined"" on the set. He may have been well-behaved, but according to Dame Helen there was also room for spontaneity. ""Russell often would improvise. I would more go the route of saying, I could say this and pass it by the writer."" Dame Helen, 65, sees Arthur as breaking new ground for her in career terms. ""I did it because Id never done a big, full-out comedy before. Ive done films that are comedic, but Ive never done a film that is a comedy."" The actress says she often finds herself ""frightened and intimidated"" on movie sets, as was the case with Arthur. Surprisingly perhaps, she finds that she is often in awe of the big names with whom she works. ""I get totally starstruck. I cant talk to them and I dont feel good enough,"" she says. Drunkenness Brand, 35, says bringing Arthur up to date involved some adjustments, including addressing ""the changing attitude to alcoholism"". In the original picture, Arthurs constant drunkenness was presented as a harmless indulgence. Now, though, it would be viewed as full-blown alcoholism. Indeed, the new film depicts Arthur attending an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Brand, who has admitted his own problems with addiction in the past, thinks his own experiences may have helped him with his portrayal. One would hope that from this point I will be able to build a legacy of which I could be proud Russell Brand In a move that will alarm some recovering alcoholics, the star reveals that whiskey was on hand while the film was being shot. ""I would carry a bottle of booze about on the set and before takes have a big nostril-full of whiskey to get myself prepared, to evoke the memories of my drunken days,"" says the dandyish joker. However, Brand insists he was aware of the risks involved. ""Some people said it was dangerous and were concerned about it,"" he reveals. ""But if ever anyone saw me begin to raise it to my lips in an attempt to once more release the demons from within, then people would clutch it pretty quickly."" US actress Greta Gerwig, best known for her work in independent cinema, plays Arthurs love interest in the film. In the 1981 version that role belonged to Liza Minnelli, who has been reticent when it comes to the new production. ""It has nothing to do with me,"" the Cabaret star told reporters recently. ""I just think of Dudley so its difficult for me, thinking of him."" Mixed reviews The Arthur remake is raising Brands profile in the US, but ultimately he wants to make an impact away from the world of entertainment. ""One would hope that from this point I will be able to build a legacy of which I could be proud - that reaches beyond entertainment and into philanthropy and altruism."" Image caption The film has received mixed reviews from US critics When asked what altruistic deeds he has in mind he says: ""I think Ill have to await opportunities because Im not a grand social architect. ""I am but a comedian, but I would just like to think that Im prepared spiritually to be open."" Arthur performed modesty at the US box office in its opening weekend and has received some damning reviews. The New York Times referred to the film as a ""grim load of mediocrity"", while other reviewers have described it as bland and muddle-headed. Many commentators take the view that the original was such a beloved classic that any remake was bound to fall short. Yet it has some supporters. The San Francisco Chronicle, for example, found Brand ""a worthy successor to Dudley Moore who has a darkness inside him that feels right for the time and for the character"".

Would-be cleaner Denise Gough reprises polished performance,"As the National Theatre's People, Places and Things transfers to the West End, audiences have another chance to see Denise Gough's performance that could win her an Olivier award next month.",,20 March 2016,BBC News,"Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption Denise Gough as Emma in People, Places and Things Denise Goughs role as a recovering addict in the National Theatres People, Places and Things was one of the theatrical highlights of 2015. As the play transfers to the West End, audiences have another chance to see the performance that could win her an Olivier award next month. What a difference a year makes. At the beginning of 2015, Denise Gough almost quit acting. She couldnt make ends meet. ""I had a year out of work before this job,"" explains the Irish actress. ""I applied to be a cleaner this time last year. Thats not joking. Thats the truth for many jobbing actors and actresses. ""It would be lovely if we were all in a position to say its vulgar to talk about money, but most of us have to talk about it because we cant pay our rent when we are out of work."" As things turned out, Gough didnt get the cleaning job. But she did land the lead role in Duncan Macmillans new play, People, Places and Things. Her performance was described as ""career-changing"", ""Class-A"" and ""emotionally shattering"". Directed by Jeremy Herrin, the play was a sellout at the Nationals Dorfman Theatre last year. It begins with Goughs character Emma having a meltdown during a production of Chekhovs The Seagull. Soon shes in rehab and on a 12-step programme to tackle her addiction to drink and drugs. Gough won the Critics Circle best actress award for the role in January and was nominated in the same category at last years Evening Standard theatre awards, where she was beaten by Nicole Kidman for her role in Photograph 51. Gough and Kidman go head to head again at the Olivier awards on 3 April in a best actress field that also includes Gemma Arterton (Nell Gwynn), Janet McTeer (Les Liaisons Dangereuses) and Lia Williams (Oresteia). People, Places and Things has four Olivier nominations in total - including best new play. Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption People, Places and Things has four nominations at this years Olivier Awards So how ""career-changing"" has it been for Gough? ""What this has done has changed the level that Im at,"" she says. ""I had never worked at the National before and now I can talk about projects that I want to do."" Also important to her is the type of role it is. ""This character is indicative of the kind of parts we need for women on stage - and on film and TV. A woman that is not an appendage to a man. ""After a while it gets tiresome falling in love over and over on stage. This part for me is such a fantastic addition to the canon of parts that will now be available for young women to play."" Gough leans in, speaking quickly as she warms to her theme. ""A young guy came up to me about a month after our play finished [at the National]. He said he went to see our play and the day after he went to his first AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] meeting and hes been clean and sober since. ""I know that were always talking about theatre having the power to change lives, but it really does. Im proud to be part of something where Im saying something more than, Arent I pretty in a dress? Im not just wafting around the stage."" She pauses, and then adds with a smile: ""Although I will be wafting around the stage in other productions - just not this one."" Gough is a supporter of the 50/50 by 2018 campaign which wants to see women represented on screen, in television and theatre in equal numbers to men. ""We are 50% of the population and yet in film less than a third of the speaking characters are female. That has to change. I think of my niece. I want her to watch things and be able to go to the theatre and see herself on stage. ""The conversation is starting and it needs to keep going. The more represented we are the more we can address the gender pay gap."" Image copyright Johan Persson Image caption The play begins with Goughs character Emma having a stage meltdown during a production of Chekhovs The Seagull In 2014, Gough played Julia alongside Gemma Arterton in The Duchess of Malfi at the new Sam Wanamaker Playhouse at Shakespeares Globe. Her previous London theatre credits include Jesus Hopped the A Train, Six Characters in Search of an Author and As You Like It. She won the Critics Circle Award in 2012 for most promising newcomer for Desire Under the Elms at the Lyric Hammersmith. ""I said in my speech at the time Id been around for about 12 years!"" recalls Gough. ""I have been thinking about that a lot. If that award had happened when I was a newcomer at 23 I dont think Id have been ready for any of that. Im having a tiny taste of attention around my work since last year. I dont know how really young people deal with that. ""Im very glad to be mid-30s and a bit more grounded. Its very seductive and you can become a bit of an arse if youre not careful."" She offers an anecdote about why shell resist the trappings of fame. ""I went home recently and a magazine on which Im the front cover was in the bidet in my parents bathroom. ""Not on it - in it! That is why I will never forget where Ive come from.""

Children of alcoholics 'damaged',,,2006-09-03 23:57:15,,"Children of alcoholics are more likely to become addicted The Priory study said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to be addicted to drink and there was a risk of drug and gambling problems. The private health provider said a childs early life was characterised by chaos, trauma, confusion and shame and, quite often, sexual and physical abuse. The report found 55% of domestic violence occurs in alcoholic homes. The children of alcoholics can break the cycle Professor Martin Plant, addictions expert The Priory reviewed existing data on crime, abuse and alcoholism as well as consulting its own doctors and therapists to compile the report. It said the problems children of alcoholics experience in early life had a profound impact later in life. The report said growing up in an alcoholic household was inextricably linked to abuse. Some 55% of family violence occurs in alcoholic homes with alcohol a factor in 90% of child abuse cases. Studies have also showed a third of daughters of alcoholics experienced physical abuse and a fifth sexual abuse - up to four times higher than in non-alcoholic homes, the Priory said. The report said children reacted in one of three ways - either they became withdrawn, went into denial or used the experience to benefit themselves by becoming stronger. Many of the children of alcoholics, even those who would perhaps have been withdrawn, could grow up to be likeable, kind and intuitive. Difficulties But the problems surfaced when they had to confront difficulties. The report said: ""Their feelings about themselves are the opposite of the serene image they present - they generally feel insecure, inadequate, dull, unsuccessful, vulnerable and anxious"". They also struggled to develop strong personal relationships. Researchers said previous studies had revealed that 70% of children of alcoholics develop compulsive behaviour around either alcohol, drugs, food, sex, work or gambling, while a half ended up marrying alcoholics. And they said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to become alcoholics - partly because of genetics - than the one in 20 of the general population that have the condition currently. Priory addictions expert Dr Michael Bristow said: ""There is a widespread misconception that addiction is all about the addict, that it is solely the addict who suffer from his illness. ""The reality? Alcoholism affects the adult alcoholics entire family, particularly the children."" Professor Martin Plant, an addiction expert at the University of the West of England, said: ""These findings are not altogether surprising. But what I would like to stress, is that it is not inevitable. ""The children of alcoholics can break the cycle, many end up loathing alcohol and refusing to let it destroy their lives like it may have done to their parents.""",{},"['report', 'likely', 'priory', 'withdrawn', 'times', 'alcoholic', 'alcoholics', 'alcohol', 'children', 'abuse', 'damaged']","Children of alcoholics are more likely to become addictedThe Priory study said children of alcoholics were four times more likely to be addicted to drink and there was a risk of drug and gambling problems.

The shocking legacies of Nazi medical research,"Our pick of the week from around the web, including why Hitler's victims still haunt modern science and the video game designer rewriting the rules of chess.",Robert Cottrell,2013-11-09 00:00:00,,"The hidden technology that makes Twitter huge Paul Ford | Business Week | 7 November 2013 Twitter thrives for two main reasons. First, it’s cunningly engineered: The visible Tweet contains up to 140 characters, but each message also has 31 hidden data fields which allow Twitter to analyse and monetise network activity. Second, it has uncovered value in “a latent aspect of human life”, something that humans produce freely and plentifully, but which was previously seen as worthless: trivial chatter. The Nazi anatomists Emily Bazelon | Slate | 6 November 2013 Remarkable – and often repugnant – piece of writing and reporting on the legacies of Nazi medical research. Anatomists accepted the bodies of thousands killed by Hitler’s regime; German, Austrian, Polish universities still hold remains in their collections. Nazi theories recur even now in America’s abortion debate. Half of Germany’s doctors joined the Nazi Party; almost all continued practising after the war. Bitcoin Is broken Emin Gün Sirer & Ittay Eyal | Hacking Distributed | 4 November 2013 Researchers claim to have discovered a fundamental flaw in Bitcoin which could enable dishonest miners to hijack the currency. “The Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible. The protocol can be gamed by people with selfish interests. And once the system veers away from the happy mode where everyone is honest, there is no force that opposes the growth of really large pools that command control of the currency.” In praise of the polymath Robert Twigger | Aeon | 4 November 2013 We overvalue specialists in the intellectual world, and undervalue generalists — perhaps because the division of labour has worked well in the business world. But skilled polymaths are happier and more innovative. “Over-specialisation eventually retreats into defending what one has learnt rather than making new connections. The initial spurt of learning gives out, and the expert is left, like an animal, merely defending his territory.” What is theoretical physics, and why do it? Mark Jackson | The Conversation | 4 November 2013 A physicist explains. “Theoretical physicists construct theories of nature. For a theory to be true it must be both consistent with itself and consistent with nature. The first can be verified with mathematics, the second with experiment. Scientific exploration is like geographical exploration. Popular lore can be sometimes dramatically overturned, like the interdiction against sailing too far away, lest you fall off the edge of the world.” Why Russia’s drinkers resist AA Leon Neyfakh | Boston Globe | 3rd November 2013 Russia has a colossal drinking problem. Alcoholics Anonymous has shown the power of mutual support groups to combat alcoholism. Yet AA has made almost no headway in Russia: there are four times as many AA groups in Boston as in the whole of Russia. Why? Because Russians don’t think drinking is wrong, and they have low levels of trust. “The idea that another drunk can help you is asinine to most Russians.” Chess 2: The sequel Christian Donlan | Eurogamer | 3 November 2013 Video-game designer revises the rules of chess to reduce the proportion of draws. “The new victory condition is the simplest, and most immediately satisfying, part of Chess 2. While games still often hinge on good old checkmates, you can now also win if you manage to get your king across the middle of the board. It’s bold stuff when you see it in action: a proper NFL touchdown in the midst of a chess game!” Review: Basic Structures of Reality, by Colin McGinn Kerry McKenzie | Mind | 31 October 2013 Philosopher’s attempt to learn and analyse fundamental physics receives one of the most hostile book reviews ever published: “An impressively inept contribution to the philosophy of physics, and one exemplifying everything that can possibly go wrong with metaphyics; it is mind-numbingly repetitive, toe-curlingly pretentious, and amateurish in the extreme regarding the incorporation of physical fact.” (PDF) Paul Graham and Y Combinator Robert Greene | 30 October 2013 Graham was already wealthy from having built and sold an online commerce start-up, when he gave a talk at Harvard in 2005 and was besieged by students wanting to know how to turn their ideas into businesses.

People have been sharing their drinking habits after presenter Adrian Chiles revealed he sometimes drank more than 100 units a week - more than seven times the recommended limit. He said drinking never affects his life and he considers himself a social drinker, not an alcoholic. Other heavy drinkers have been speaking about their alcohol consumption. Do I want to stop? No Paul Tomlinson, 48, from Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire says it is ""easy to rack up drinking when youre sat at home"". ""I regularly drink 80 to 100 units a week, most of it between Friday and Sunday. ""On each night I will usually have two or three beers - sometimes alcohol free now actually - followed by a bottle of wine and then two or three large gin and tonics. ""This is roughly 16 to 18 units a night for three consecutive nights. I will then do at least two or three more bottles of wine in the week with a couple of gin and tonics again. Image copyright Paul Tomlinson Image caption Paul Tomlinson says society primes people to drink alcohol ""Do I consider myself an alcoholic? No! Do I want to stop drinking at the level I do? Not really. ""I have a disabled son who is 24 so dont go out often and as a result drink more at home. ""I dont go to bed feeling outrageously drunk and I dont black out on the sofa."" £500 a month on wine One man, who chose to remain anonymous, says his father was an ""old fashioned"" alcoholic who started drinking in the morning - but that he is not an alcoholic. ""I find myself in the habit of putting away one and a half to two bottles of white wine every night, unless Im really thirsty in which case it might be two and a half bottles. ""I start at 6 or 7pm, couple of glasses whilst preparing family supper, continue through PS4 ""wind down"" time, another couple of glasses. ""Then usually finish off the second bottle whilst listening to music. Tada! £500 a month on wine. ""Im in a strange position, as I can (and do) stop when I want to - sometimes for a month or two just to prove to myself Im not an alcoholic like my dad. ""Ill go out with my mates and not touch a drop, again - just to prove a point to myself. And yet I still drink far, far too much. Image copyright Getty Images ""Im rarely drunk nowadays, although obviously I still dont drive. I just wish someone would make a drink that tastes as nice as wine, without the alcohol. ""Im currently losing weight and so have ""limited"" myself to a half to one bottle of wine a night. ""I find that the problem is the habit more than alcohol. I smoked 20 plus a day for 20 years then quit five years ago, with no patches etc. ""Never felt like a relapse, never been tempted to have just one. I think alcohol is in the same category. ""Although, as I can testify with my father, the drug is insidious and rather than just kill your body, if you let it, it will kill your personality first."" Im all or nothing Adrian Chiles account of his alcohol consumption ""mirrors almost exactly"" how Mark Baker, 58, from North Somerset, says he drinks. ""Like him I drink about 80 to 100 units a week and have done so for many years. ""I have a slight fatty liver (as does he) but otherwise perfectly OK. I have never suffered from depression or anxiety. ""I drink mostly out of habit. I never get drunk, drink and drive, I never drink in the mornings or at lunchtime, I just like a drink in the evening to wind down and relax. ""I am an export manager so drinking is part of the territory. Image copyright Getty Images ""Last year in October I stopped drinking for a month. I was worried that I was dependent on it. ""I found it easy to do especially as there are so many products on the market with low or no alcohol. I could still have a beer, glass of wine or even a gin and tonic. Yes, there is low alcohol spirit. ""Like Adrian, I will probably give up drinking rather than rationing it as when I have tried that in the past it never seems to work. I am definitely an all or nothing person."" I will try and cut down Annemarie McAleese, 48, from Belfast, owns her own restaurant and says she starts drinking wine when she gets home as she ""potters about"". ""On average I would drink two bottles of white wine each night, and have done for the last seven years. ""I have my own business, and work in it five or six days per week. ""After reading this article, I think now is the time to rethink my drinking habits. ""Its a very bad habit. I think I will try to cut down. I think I use owning my business as an excuse because it can be quite stressful. ""I wont watch the programme with my husband because I dont need somebody yapping in my ear you need to stop, I need to do this for myself."" High functioning alcoholic John, from Essex, says he considered himself a ""moderate social drinker"" until he developed liver disease. ""Then I gave up drinking altogether but the liver disease worsened leading to many hospital visits and the need for a liver transplant. ""I had never missed work or put drink ahead of all else but when I detailed out my daily drinking to numerous doctors over a nine-month period I was embarrassed to realise that I was effectively a high-functioning alcoholic. ""I am pleased to say that thanks to my organ donor I have led a healthy, happy life for the last eight years and become a grandfather three times. ""Something I would have missed if I had carried on as before.

""If Adrians show makes anyone seriously look at the amount they drink and reduce it then he is doing a great job. ""On the subject of giving up alcohol I feel sometimes too much is made of how difficult this is, rather than concentrating on the benefits of being sober. ""Better health, better sleep, no hangovers, higher alertness and an ability to enjoy things with a clear head."" Alcohol and health The number of adults who say they drink alcohol is at its lowest level since surveys began in 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week. If you do drink that much, it is best to spread it over three or more days. One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units. Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.

Obituary: Dora Bryan,"Dora Bryan, who has died 91, was a talented character actress who played everything from Ibsen to Absolutely Fabulous.",,23 July 2014,BBC News,"Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicals Dora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy. The variety of the roles she played, including parts in plays by Ibsen and Pinter, belied her caricature as a wide-eyed dizzy blonde. Born Dora May Broadbent in Southport, Lancashire in 1924, she went to a council school and, encouraged by her ambitious mother, made her first stage appearance at the age of 12, in pantomime in Manchester. Image caption Bryan recorded the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh with Nicholas Parsons (far right) During World War 2 she worked in repertory theatre and with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) - an organisation set up in 1939 to provide entertainment for British armed forces personnel during the war. She moved to London in 1945 and appeared in a number of West End productions - notably in the Lyric and Globe revues in the 1950s. Image caption In 2000, Bryan joined the cast of Last of the Summer Wine but left five years later She changed her name to Bryan, taking it from the match manufacturers Bryant and May. She lost the closing ""t"" when a theatre programme misspelled her name. In 1966, the actress played the title role in Hello, Dolly at Drury Lane, eating a full chicken dinner on stage six nights a week and at two matinees. In 1968 she played nine parts as the star of They Dont Grow on Trees at the Prince of Wales. Later, she was in the National Theatres She Stoops to Conquer (for which she won an award) and a revival of Charlie Girl. And she took the West End by storm in a lavish 2002 musical production of The Full Monty. Speaking to Michael Parkinson on Desert Island Discs in 1987, she said musical theatre had always held a special place in her heart. ""I was in rep for seven years and to get a marvellous part in a play is great, it really is super, particularly if its a funny part and there is nothing like making an audience laugh. ""But with musicals, I like the atmosphere backstage. You go backstage in a real theatre, in a real plush and gilt theatre and you can shout to the dressing room opposite you and youre all clustered in together, you get a real theatrical atmosphere."" Her theatre career was crowned with a prestigious Olivier award in recognition of her role, as Meg, in a National Theatre production of Harold Pinters The Birthday Party. Ab Fab But she was not just a stage actress - she made her big screen debut in 1948s The Fallen Idol. About 40 further films followed, including The Blue Lamp, The Great St. Trinians Train Robbery, The Sandwich Man and Two a Penny. The peak of her career came as she played the domineering, promiscuous, alcoholic mother, Helen in the 1961 film A Taste of Honey. The role won her a Bafta award for best actress. Image caption In 1994, she was cast in the play Bed, which presented a vast dreamscape of seven very old people - all of whom share the same vast bed Image caption Bryan and June Whitfield acted together in the fourth series of Absolutely Fabulous On television, she appeared in According to Dora and Both Ends Meet and, latterly, she joined a star-studded cast in Last of the Summer Wine. In an interview with the Church Times in 2006, she said: ""I got my part as Roz in Last of the Summer Wine through Thora Hird. We had always been friends, and always nattered on about the old days. ""We knew actors most people have now forgotten. Then, a few years ago, she suddenly said: I wish you were in it with me."" Image caption Among Bryans numerous TV appearances was an episode of Casualty She also brought the house down with a recurring cameo role in Absolutely Fabulous as June Whitfields on-screen friend Dolly. This is Your Life Dora Bryan was also in the post-war radio show Much Binding in the Marsh. And she once made a novelty record, All I Want for Christmas is a Beatle, which became an unexpected hit. However her life was also touched by tragedy. Her adopted daughter Georgina died from alcoholism, her son Daniel endured a debilitating illness and she herself experienced alcoholism. She told the Church Times she was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous. ""I got very lonely on tour,"" she said, ""and used to order room-service with a bottle of wine, which was not the answer. I dont miss it at all, and just enjoy coffee or tea."" Bryans husband, Lancashire County Cricketer Bill Lawton, died from Alzheimers in 2008 and Dora, in her later years, became unable to work, as short-term memory loss affected her ability to learn lines. She was honoured twice by TV tribute show This Is Your Life, in 1962 and again in 1989. In her book, According to Dora, she remembered her first appearance. ""I was hoping the BBC would have filmed a message from my brother John in South Africa. It never occurred to me that they would have gone to all the trouble and expense of flying him from Cape Town, and I must admit that when he walked on to the stage with his wife Marguerite, I cried a little from sheer happiness."" On her second appearance, host Eamonn Andrews ""ambushed"" the actress in her living room, before whisking her to the TV studio to hear tributes from her friends and family. ""Tonight?"" exclaimed the star. ""Oh dear! Ive got to do some auditions at four!"" Her final film appearance was in Gone to the Dogs (2006) opposite Anthony Booth. The indomitable actress said that in her life she was helped through the bad times by her family, her faith and the next challenge around the corner.",{},"['bryan', 'caption', 'actress', 'role', 'tv', 'played', 'dora', 'wine', 'theatre', 'obituary', 'stage']","Image caption Bryan starred in her own BBC show in 1964, in which she sang and performed sketches from London revues and musicalsDora Bryan was a talented character actress who could turn her hand to everything from musicals to Shakespeare, farce to tragedy.

Lindsay Lohan's chequered life in the spotlight,"As actress Lindsay Lohan is given a prison sentence for probation violation, a look at the Hollywood star's career and troubled life lived in the spotlight.",,7 July 2010,BBC News,"Image caption Good times, bad times: Lindsay Lohan receives an award in 2004 and learns of her prison term in 2010 The latest chapter in Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohans chequered life was, like many others, played out in front of the camera. The 24-year-old wept into her lawyers shoulder in a Los Angeles courtroom as she was handed a 90-day prison sentence for probation violation, relating to a drugs charge dating back to 2007. Lohans life in front of the lens began at a very early age. Born Lindsay Dee Lohan in the Bronx, New York, on 2 July, 1986, she became a child model at the age of three, appearing in Vogue, Elle and a string of television commercials for the likes of Pizza Hut and The Gap. Image caption Lohan shot to fame as a fresh-faced Disney film star By the age of 10, she had landed a role in US soap opera Another World, a fertile breeding ground for new talent, which also give early roles to Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. Lohan made her feature film debut just a year later in squeaky clean Disney hit The Parent Trap. Her life in film progressed smoothly and wholesomely, with critically-approved comedy roles in Freaky Friday, teen hit Mean Girls and Herbie Fully Loaded adding to her profile. Annus horribilis A fresh-faced Lohan picked up an impressive clutch of Teen Choice and MTV Movie Award gongs. She branched out in 2004, becoming the youngest host of the MTV award ceremony, and developed an increasingly high profile away from the confines of Hollywoods film sets. Her apparent weight loss and a string of car accidents created tabloid headlines, and the paparazzi began to trail the young star around Los Angeles. Lohan, meanwhile, continued to diversify. She had sung the closing song in Disneys remake of Freaky Friday, which resulted in a record contract. Her debut album, Speak, was released in 2004 and made it to number four in the US album chart. Image caption Lohan (left) won high praise for her role in fish-out-of-water high school comedy Mean Girls Her follow-up a year later also proved a hit, and was a more soul-searching, confessional record about her relationship with her family, which she admitted had been a difficult one. Songwriting, Lohan said, was a way of finding escape from the increasing pressures of her life in the Hollywood goldfish bowl. Cameo roles followed in more adult-orientated films, including A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby - but Lohans reputation for enjoying the high life grew in 2006 when she was rebuked for late arrivals on the set of the film Georgia Rules. The films producer suggested in a letter, leaked to the press, that the actresss ""heat exhaustion"" was simply the result of ""ongoing all night heavy partying"". She began to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and admitted herself to a rehabilitation clinic in early 2007 - in what proved to be an annus horribilis for the star. Lohan was arrested twice for driving and drug offences and had two more stints in rehab. A jail sentence was imposed but she spent only 84 minutes behind bars, and was forced to visit a mortuary to learn the impact of drink-driving. While her personal life was splashed across the front pages, her film career was hitting a low point. Grisly psychological thriller I Know Who Killed Me was mauled by the critics - The New York Post branded it ""sleazy, inept and worthless - and Lohan was given the dubious honour of a Razzie award for worst performance. Image caption Lohans liaison with Samantha Ronson was followed closely by the press Subsequent years saw Lohan drift into smaller TV roles, including fronting a BBC documentary about child trafficking, while the tabloid headlines kept rolling in. She had a much-publicised relationship with DJ Samantha Ronson, but refused to answer questions about her sexuality. The couples subsequent break-up saw Lohan take the unusual step of putting out a spoof video dating advert, introducing herself as ""a workaholic, a shopaholic and, according to the state of California, an alcoholic"". Lohan also joked about her ongoing probation and the ever-growing number of Google searches about her private life. In recent months, the actress has gained further notoriety for brushes with the legal system and her apparently wayward lifestyle. She missed a routine court appearance, unable to return from the Cannes Film Festival after losing her passport. An initial warrant for her arrest was later revoked. Lohan was later ordered to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet as part of her probation deal, which activated during an MTV Movie Awards party. I did do everything I was told to do and did the best I could to balance jobs and showing up Lindsay Lohan at her latest court appearance Lindsay Lohan jailed for 90 days The final path to jail was laid when she failed to attend alcohol education classes, although she insisted she had done ""everything I was told to do"". After a stint in jail and court-ordered rehabilitation, the future looks uncertain for Lohan. Her recent foray into fashion was not a resounding success, while a question hangs over her movie career. Lohan had been lined up to play 1970s porn legend Linda Lovelace, a world away from the squeaky clean roles which originally propelled her into the spotlight. Whether the Hollywood star has the capacity to generate news stories about her work rather than her fraught personal life remains to be seen.",{},"['award', 'caption', 'chequered', 'lohan', 'lindsay', 'life', 'spotlight', 'later', 'high', 'film', 'roles', 'probation', 'lohans']","Image caption Good times, bad times: Lindsay Lohan receives an award in 2004 and learns of her prison term in 2010The latest chapter in Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan's chequered life was, like many others, played out in front of the camera.

Rapist Robert Foye has minimum prison sentence halved,A man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.,,28 September 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Foye raped the schoolgirl while on the run from Castle Huntly prison A man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has had his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges. Robert Foye was jailed for a minimum of nine years over the attack on the 16-year-old in August 2007. However, minimum sentencing guidelines were changed following successful appeals earlier this year by Foye and paedophile Morris Petch. Under new guidelines for discretionary life sentences, Foye, 32, will serve a minimum of four-and-a-half years. Scottish Conservative justice spokesman John Lamont said the public would be ""aghast"" at the decision. Scottish Labours justice spokeswoman Johann Lamont said the public would be ""horrified"" that Foye could be considered for parole after such a short time in prison. Appalling crime Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said he planned to bring forward changes in the law this year which would address the issues raised in the judgement. ""I respect the decision of the court - but I am aware that many people will be concerned that the minimum punishment part in this case has been reduced,"" he said. ""It was a truly appalling crime that Robert Foye committed."" Following his conviction, Foyes defence lawyer appealed against the way trial judge Lady Smith had arrived at her decision on the minimum jail term to be served. In March, following an appeal by Foye and Petch, judges overruled previous guidelines for setting the punishment part of discretionary life sentences and orders for lifelong restriction. After hearing Foyes appeal, based on the revised guidelines, judges Lord Osborne, sitting with Lords Woolman and Wheatley said he can now make a bid for release after serving four-and-a-half years. Guilty plea In the written ruling, Lord Osborne said it may be of some comfort to those concerned that, after that time, Foye would only be freed if the parole board were satisfied he no longer posed a threat to the public. Orders for lifelong restriction (OLR) - the kind of life sentence imposed on Foye in October 2008 - were introduced five years ago. Since then, no prisoner given an OLR has been freed, no matter how short their so-called punishment part, or minimum sentence. Foye, who admitted raping the schoolgirl, had been on the run for almost a week when he carried out the attack. He had been allowed out of Castle Huntly open prison, near Dundee, to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Foye, then 28, had lived rough in woods, drinking heavily, before he seized the girl in broad daylight as she returned from Cumbernauld town centre after collecting new contact lenses on 24 August 2007. It later emerged that Foye had absconded from the open prison on a previous occasion in 2005.",{},"['robert', 'rapist', 'appeal', 'short', 'guidelines', 'life', 'minimum', 'foye', 'prison', 'punishment', 'halved', 'schoolgirl', 'sentence', 'run']","Image caption Foye raped the schoolgirl while on the run from Castle Huntly prisonA man who raped a schoolgirl while on the run from prison has had his minimum sentenced halved by appeal judges.

Shot barrister Mark Saunders' 20-year alcohol struggle,"Mark Saunders, the barrister shot dead by police marksmen, was a ""gutsy and polished"" courtroom opponent - but had his own two-decade struggle with alcohol.",,7 October 2010,BBC News,"Image caption Mr Saunders ended two months of sobriety the day before he died In the crucible of the courtroom, he was an impressive figure. Described in one directory of lawyers as ""popular, gutsy and polished"", Oxford graduate Mark Saunders fought on behalf of celebrity clients in high-profile and often acrimonious divorce cases. But for nearly 20 years, he was struggling to control his alcohol intake. It was following one heavy afternoon binge in the spring of 2008 that 32-year-old Mr Saunders found himself with a bottle of wine in one hand and a shotgun in the other, firing from the window of his £2m flat in Chelsea. Police said they feared for their safety and the publics. On Thursday an inquest jury agreed that they had lawfully killed Mr Saunders. When Mr Saunders began drinking at the age of 13, it was not to escape the reality of a sad and deprived life. Rather, it was in the surroundings of his private school in Cheshire. After gaining his law degree from Christ Church College, Oxford, and serving with the Territorial Army, he joined the respected QEB Chambers in central London. But while his profession career soared, his descent into alcohol abuse accelerated. Out of control By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights. He himself admitted he was ""out of control"". Some weeks he would drink the equivalent of four bottles of spirits. That year, he received a police caution for being drunk and disorderly. His wife of two years, Elizabeth, also a barrister, told the inquest her husband was a ""sensitive"" man with a ""huge energy and love for life"". They were, she said, ""very much in love"". Image caption Mr Saunders marriage to Elizabeth was strained by his drinking But their marriage was considerably strained by his drinking. ""I know he contacted Alcoholics Anonymous and went there on three or four occasions,"" she told the inquest jury. ""But he felt it wasnt for him, and it didnt work out. ""What Mark wanted to do was control the drinking, to be able to be a social drinker. There were occasions, probably every three months or so, when it went wrong."" Mr Saunders best friend Alex Booth often saw what happened when it did go wrong. ""He completely lost touch with reality,"" he said in a statement. Mr Booth explained how his friend had ended up in casualty on several occasions, and while drinking he would be ""in a fantasy world, he wouldnt respond or engage with you"". That fantasy world was often induced by cocaine as well as alcohol. Tests revealed Mr Saunders had used the drug regularly in the six months before his death - although not within the last 12 hours of his life. His wife knew nothing of his drug habit. Mr Saunders did recognise he had a problem and sought help. To stabilise his mood swings, he was prescribed the antidepressant Prozac. In 2006, a psychiatrist examined him and warned that if he did not ""abstain completely from all mind-altering substances"" he could find himself being killed in a fight. Bulging eyes The other fear, according to medical notes, was that Mr Saunders would commit suicide if a period of depression and an alcohol binge coincided. In February 2008, he told his wife he was giving up drinking for good. He was sober for the next two months. On the evening of 5 May, he had one glass of wine. The following day would be Mr Saunders last. It is unclear at what point in the afternoon he began drinking, but by the time a taxi driver dropped him off near his home at about 1600 BST, it was evident that he was drunk. Image caption Mr Saunders was shot as he levelled his shotgun from his flat window Blood tests would later reveal him to be three times over the drink-drive limit. David Hay, the taxi driver, said: ""At that point he turned back round and I gave him his change and he was looking straight at me and just said: Im going to die."" ""When he looked at me his eyes were large and bulging. I could see the terror in his eyes."" Half an hour later, Mr Saunders loaded the shotgun he legally owned and fired the first shots from his kitchen window, triggering the five-hour standoff with armed officers of the Metropolitan Polices CO19 firearms unit. When the fatal shots were fired at half past 2130 BST, Mr Saunders was alone. Police had refused his wish to talk to his family - fearing he wanted to say goodbye and take his life. Instead, he was surrounded by broken glass and a wine bottle as he died.",{},"['wife', 'months', 'occasions', 'told', 'mark', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'barrister', 'life', 'mr', 'saunders', 'struggle', 'shot', 'shotgun', 'inquest', '20year']","'Out of control'By 2005 - three years before his death - Mr Saunders was drinking to excess most nights.

9/11: The 73 minutes that changed my life,"Like thousands of others, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes has changed his life in a profound way and will, he believes, continue to affect him until the day he dies.",,5 September 2011,BBC News,"Like thousands of other New Yorkers, Artie Van Why saw the attacks on the World Trade Center from the streets below. What he witnessed in those minutes changed his life profoundly and will, he believes, continue to haunt him until the day he dies. The moment he walked through the revolving doors of his office building and stepped on to the street on that sunny September morning, Artie Van Whys world shifted a few degrees on its axis. It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world His life from that instant took a different course, propelled by the mayhem that enveloped him that day, events the world later identified by two numbers, nine and 11. Millions of people watched on television as four hijacked planes crashed in the US, two of them into one famous New York landmark. But Van Why was in the thick of it. The experience forced him to leave New York, his home for 26 years, and move more than 100 miles west to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, deep in Amish country. Download the tablet version PDF download The 73 minutes that changed my life [655 KB] Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Ten years after the atrocities, sitting in the corner of a humble one-bedroom apartment located above a funeral home, his face is a picture of concentration as he recalls the days events. ""I remember it was a beautiful day. Whenever I see a really beautiful blue sky, it takes me back to that morning."" He was working as a clerical assistant at law firm Holland & Knight, and his office was on the 23rd floor of a building separated from the World Trade Center site only by Church Street and the Millennium Hilton hotel. At 08:46, a loud boom shook the building. A colleague asked if it was thunder, then someone screamed for everyone to get out of the building, because a plane had hit one of the twin towers. Expecting to see a small aircraft sticking out of the famous skyscraper, Van Why took the lift to the ground floor and exited through a revolving door. ""It was like the Wizard of Oz, stepping into another world. It seemed as everything slowed down and it was going frame by frame as if in slow motion. ""All these white paper sheets were covering the ground like snow and coming down. I remember thinking that Id never seen so much paper. ""I walked a short distance to Church Street where the towers were and thats when I saw the North Tower for the first time. I was dumbstruck. It was hard to comprehend what I was seeing. ""There was a huge black hole, the flames were bright orange and the smoke was billowing out of the tower."" More people were arriving on the streets, he says, and sirens could be heard in the background. As his recollections become more vivid, the 58-year-old closes his eyes and rocks back and forth in his orange armchair, his right foot tapping the carpet vigorously. His rented apartment is full of reminders of what he went through. A photo of the World Trade Center is on the fridge, and other photographs featuring the famous Manhattan skyline adorn the living room, like pictures of a deceased member of the family. Image caption Reminders of the life left behind fill his apartment One wall is full of framed newspaper cuttings, reviews of the play that Van Why - a former actor - wrote and performed about 9/11. And in front of this shrine, he sits and recalls the minutes that reshaped his life, wild hand gestures making the scene all the more real. ""I dont know how long I was looking at the North Tower, trying to take it all in. I was transfixed. What broke it was when I realised there were other things falling, there were people falling and everyone realised at the same time. ""People started screaming and my reaction was to scream No, No, No! at the thought that people were falling down. And thats when - I dont know why I reacted in this way - but my instinct was to run towards them. I remember shouting out God, save us all! ""I ran to the plaza where they were falling. I didnt have a moments thought, I just ran towards the tower, thinking Can I help these people? I imagined them laying there and the thought of being able to hold their hand or sit and be with them, comfort them."" Another man was running with him, and for a moment, the two stopped and stood side by side, taking in the enormity of what they were seeing - human beings jumping to their deaths. Van Why recalls seeing bodies piling up on the ground. ""One of my most vivid memories is looking to my left and I saw this man in a suit falling. Somehow I had thought that if you ever jumped from a high place, you would be dead before you hit the ground. ""But I remember seeing how very much alive he was and I can still see his arms and legs moving as if to brace himself. Fortunately I didnt see him hit."" Some guards shouted for the two men to come to safety through another World Trade Center Building, number 5. They went down a lift and out of the site on to Church Street, from where Van Why saw the second plane hit the South Tower, only 17 minutes after the first. Pandemonium broke out. Debris was raining down, he says, as he ran towards Fulton Street, at one point falling to the ground. ""People started to run over the top of me and I thought I was going to be trampled to death but I managed to get up. I remember shouting out God, save us all!"" He recalls an African-American woman tripping and being helped to her feet by a businessman. Then he ran past a large man who was lying face down in the street. Getting down on his knees, Van Why saw that the man had a serious head injury. He appeared to have been hit by a putty knife that had fallen from one of the buildings and was lying nearby stained with blood. ""Another man stopped and gave me a denim jacket which we put over the open wound and then I remember seeing his watch on the street beside him and I put it in his pants [trouser] pocket. We turned him over and he had a work tag with a name."" With tears falling and his voice cracking, Van Why goes on: ""My biggest regret is that I didnt look to his tag to see what the name was. I could have found his family and told them that there were people with him."" An ambulance arrived and it required several people to lift the man on to the stretcher. Van Why stroked his arm and told him he would be fine. Realising he had left his mobile phone in the office, he began asking strangers if he could borrow one to get the message through to his parents that he was OK. But none of the phones were working, so he went into a cafe and used a telephone there. When he emerged, he heard a deafening sound. He looked to his left and saw a wall of grey smoke coming towards him. The South Tower was collapsing. For the second time that morning, he started running. The time was 09:59, 73 minutes after the first plane flew into the North Tower. By the time he got to his apartment on 43rd Street, after deliberately avoiding the area around the Empire State Building, it was approaching noon. The North Tower had also collapsed, but Van Why had been far enough away to not hear it. To see the enhanced content on this page, you need to have JavaScript enabled and Adobe Flash installed. In the days that followed, he slept only fitfully and always with the bedroom light on. ""I was afraid of the dark. It never happened before 9/11. It was a sense of security having that light on. ""For that first week I would wake up early and call my parents first thing. I would be on the phone crying with them. There was a lot of crying that week.

And still an incomprehension, trying to understand what had happened."" He avoided watching television or reading newspapers because he could not bear to see replays or photos of the planes striking the towers. He had his own images, pictures inside his head, sometimes appearing with a clarity that transported him back to the mayhem. He discovered that two men who lived in his apartment building were missing and a lawyer at work who was last seen running towards the towers was also presumed dead. Van Why had done exactly the same and survived. As a recovering alcoholic who had been sober for two years, he already had a therapist, and in the weeks following 9/11 he saw him daily. Alcoholics Anonymous meetings were also an opportunity to share his feelings with others, but he lived alone and had no partner to provide constant support. Before long he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Holland & Knight opened makeshift offices at a hotel in Midtown but he did not feel able to go back to work until two or three weeks after the attacks. When he did, it was the first time he had ventured outside his neighbourhood. A few days later, he rented a car and drove to Maryland, for a 30-year high school reunion. The sight of an aeroplane coming into land caused him to burst into tears. At the event, when he introduced himself by saying: ""Im from the greatest city in the world, New York City,"" people stood up and applauded. His old offices near Ground Zero were soon ready again, but Van Why found returning to the scene too harrowing to endure. The smell of smoke from the still-smouldering site would fill his nostrils as he emerged from the subway. The WTC plaza - once his lunchtime sanctuary - now resembled to him a grave. One morning, the police allowed him to enter the site so he could lay six roses on what he regarded as ""hallowed ground"". In November 2001, he resigned from work after 13 years of service. It was too painful to continue. He instead focused on his new project - writing his own story about his experience. I was out of the country and didnt get back to New York City until the end of October. I was in touch with Artie, aware of his proximity, but didnt fully understand the impact on him until I got home. It was unravelling. It could only be unravelling. No-one should have to witness something like that. In survival mode, he knew he no longer could stay in NYC. His family, which had always been a strong connection in his life, would provide a sense of comfort and familiarity he desperately needed. He moved out of the city and regrouped. It took time. Through his grief and pain he also found a creative outlet. He was able to process his grief by writing about it. He had written emails to family and friends following the attacks, to explain what happened, and they forwarded his story to other people. Soon he began to receive appreciative emails from strangers. Encouraged, he began to develop his story into a script, convinced it was his mission to keep the memory alive. It became a one-man play that he performed off-Broadway and in Los Angeles. ""The play gave me a sense of purpose. Those two years after 9/11, when I was really focused on my play, that is the only time in my life I felt fulfilled, because I had a purpose and I thought I was doing something important and something selfless, because I was doing it for the memory of the people I saw die."" After each performance, some people would tell him their own story of where they were, making him realise, he says, that people across the US had a story of 9/11. He was hoping he could continue performing the show for at least five years. ""I wanted to dedicate my life to it. But it closed in New York earlier than planned, the major papers ignored it and some reviews were critical, saying I was trying to profit out of it."" It seemed to him like the city was ready to move on and he was not. The spirit that defined New York in the days, weeks and months afterwards had gone, he says, and he felt a bit like a ""lone crusader"". Image caption Van Why performed his play in 2003 ""It still weighed so heavily on my emotions and who I was, so to see other people werent doing that and moving on, it was like How can they be doing that? ""There was anger and a feeling of isolation. In the month after 9/11, it was all you talked about with strangers, but two years afterwards, there was a sense that OK, you dont need to talk about this any more."" Immersing himself for years in writing and performing the play probably held him back, he admits, because he was dwelling on the events and re-living them, but not dealing with the emotions. That process did not begin until he moved. In September 2003, he started a new life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, because he wanted to be near his parents. ""I never thought I would leave New York, I envisaged my last days would be in New York but it just seemed like the right thing to do."" He felt guilty about leaving, but the pull of family was overwhelming and he felt like he had nowhere else to go. ""All of a sudden I just needed to be closer to them, I wanted it and needed it. For me and my parents, the reality that 9/11 was a day that I could have died brought the importance of being with my family to me. ""Though I was in my 50s, there was a sense that I needed mummy and daddy, that sense of security and that sense of home."" Growing up, home was Gaithersburg in Maryland, where the young Van Why was a quiet boy, according to his parents. Thelma and Art Van Why His parents endured a terrifying few hours on 11 Sept 2001 while they waited for news Relief at hearing he was OK turned to despair as they watched their son spiral into depression But in 2003, he moved to be near to them both ""Were so happy that hes moved because we became closer. Its a big change,"" says Thelma. ""But to see your own child go through that, you wonder what you can do to help."" ""He was in his own little shell, his own little world and we would try to comfort him as much as we could,"" says Art. ""We just told him we were here for him. So its really helped me to know hes starting to come round."" He says he felt different from other children - he later realised he was gay - and was bullied. After high school, he attended a small, conservative Christian college, where he majored first in Bible studies, then in drama. He moved to New York in 1977 with the dream of becoming an actor but after struggling for 10 years to get sustained work in the theatre, he gave it up. The clerical work that had been a supplement to his income became his main and only job. As a young man, hed had a difficult relationship with his parents and throughout his adult life he had seen them only three or four times a year. It was not until he moved to Pennsylvania, two years after the attacks, that his relationship with them, in his own words, ""fully healed"". ""I didnt know what it would entail, moving here, but eight years later, my relationship with my parents is incredible. It has a depth and appreciation it has never had before."" When he arrived in 2003, he didnt have a job, an apartment or a car, and he left many long-standing friendships behind in New York. And there was no-one who could relate to what he had been through. After the bright lights of Manhattan, the small city of Lancaster - with fewer than 60,000 residents and a homespun, rural charm - struck a tranquil note. Van Why withdrew socially, spending a lot of time in what he calls his ""cave"", a room where he would just watch television endlessly at weekends. Even when he was coaxed out of his isolation by colleagues for a coffee, he was lost and distracted. A low period at the end of last year, when he was often breaking down, was his grief finally being released, he believes. ""I was very fortunate I did not lose my physical life but I lost my life as I knew it. The person I was on September 10th, that person is no longer. I had to go through a very emotional period which enabled me to go and face Ground Zero."" In the last few months he has started to come out of his metaphorical cave. The first step on the road to recovery was going back to New York in April, for the first time since he left in 2003. With his parents and sister Sue by his side, he visited the place that had haunted him for nearly a decade. ""That was a huge step for me. It was very emotional but it helped to put an end to that chapter of my life. Even though I had been away for eight years, there was guilt that I had left my city when it was still healing."" Only having closed that door, could he start to regard Lancaster as home, he says. Shortly after that trip, he met someone and began a relationship. ""Being with him, I realised that I had forgotten what it was like to be happy. Its like I am stepping back into life. Im finally moving past mourning."" But there are other struggles. He has two jobs, one in the box office of the Fulton Theatre in Lancaster, and another as a cashier in a Weis supermarket. The two incomes combined earn him about $20,000 (£12,196) a year, about $50,000 (£30,494) less than he was earning in New York. I witnessed the goodness of man ""I dont believe I had witnessed the wrath of anyones God that morning. What I had been a witness to when I looked up at those burning towers was the ultimate evil that man is capable of. The evidence of just how deep hatred could run, how far it could go. But I had also been a witness to something else that day - down on the ground. I witnessed the ultimate goodness of man, the evidence of how strong courage could be, to what lengths it would go. I believe God was in the hands of everyone who reached out to someone else. He was in the arms of people on the streets as they embraced one another. He was in the tears of strangers who cried together. He was in all the lives that were given in the line of duty, in the acts of heroism. He was in the hearts of the people across the country who, as they watched the horror from afar, felt compassion."" That Day In September Its a thorn in his side, he says. ""I have debts and try to pay them off when I can and meet my basic expenses. So far, Ive been lucky to just get by."" If he had been told in 2001 that in 10 years he would be living in Pennsylvania and working in a theatre and a supermarket, he would have been shocked. ""I liked my job. I liked working down there. And, yes, I was making a good salary. I would like to think I might have developed a relationship with someone. ""At the time of 9/11, I was in the best place I had been for a long time - sober and happy. Perhaps I would have been able to take vacations and travel, things Im unable to do now."" And the images are still there every day, sometimes popping into his head without warning, with such force that he zones out while his mind revisits the carnage. ""They are like snippets of a movie. I will replay watching this one man who I saw falling, watching him. I will flash to the injured man I saw laying in the streets. Its a series of vignettes that my mind just goes back to."" A siren is enough to take him back there and its a sound that makes his body tighten. He still has not boarded a plane, although tall buildings dont instil in him the same fear they once did. A study by Cornell University suggests that the trauma suffered by witnesses like Van Why may have physically altered their brains, damaging their ability to process emotions. He says 9/11 survivors and witnesses like himself are the ""forgotten majority"", never considered among the victims. What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was ""Theyre not letting any survivors to the [10th anniversary] ceremony in New York, its just bereaved family members. ""Theres a sense that you dont count. Some people are still struggling terribly, far worse than I am. Everyone who was there is still affected to a degree, but people dont remember us. ""Were not suffering physically and werent injured that day and didnt lose a family member. Its like we dont count."" Despite the financial and mental strains, he is now looking to the future with a new optimism. ""Its my life now and Ive never accepted that before. Thats another change in the past months. Not that I was fighting it before, but theres an acceptance, Im moving out of the mourning stage and back to life again."" Its comparable to losing a partner, he says, with the memory of that loved one never disappearing but gradually losing its hold. ""I cant imagine a day going by when I dont think about it, even as a passing thought. ""What I was doing for a long time was letting 9/11 define who I was and I think Im getting away from that now. My experience of 9/11 is part of who I am but not all of me.""

你是不是工作狂？回答几个问题就知道,超时工作和无法控制想要工作的欲望并非一回事，但二者界限何在？怎样才知道自己是不是工作狂？如何确诊“工作成瘾”症状？,,2016年 11月 4日,BBC 英伦网,Image copyright Image caption （图片来源：Alamy） 所有人都喜欢努力工作的员工。 事实上，多工作、多赚钱已经被很多人视作现代社会成功的标志。能被贴上工作狂的标签更是被许多人视为一种荣誉。 但对某些人来说，着迷于工作却需要付出很多代价。健康、人际关系甚至工作质量都会受到影响——代价不可谓不高。 无论如何，强烈的工作欲望多年来已经导致很多人向治疗师和自助团体寻求帮助。这甚至会引发过劳死。日本政府本月早些时候发布的一项研究显示，五分之一的日本职场人士面临过劳死的风险。 过劳死不只是日本的问题。工作狂互戒会（Workaholics Anonymous）效仿嗜酒者互戒会（Alcoholics Anonymous）的做法制定了12步法则，他们于今年6月在英国举行了首届国际大会，吸引了来自世界各地的与会者出席。 关于工作狂的成因，目前还没有太多的相关研究。但这种现状正在改变——最近几年，这种现象开始获得更多关注，人们也不再仅仅把它当成一个流行词来看待。 Image caption “工作狂”并不是一种正式的疾病——但它绝不仅仅是一个流行词（图片来源：Getty Images） 美国精神病学协会的精神疾病诊断与统计手册是诊断精神疾病的黄金法则，但工作狂却并未被其认可为一种疾病。 然而，尽管没有精确的定义，但工作狂对人们产生的影响却有可能与健康、职业和心理问题存在关联，而研究人员也在关注此事。乔治亚大学最近开展的元分析——对现有的工作狂研究文献展开定量总结——显示，与工作态度和工作方法更为健康的同事相比，工作狂的效率反而更低。 挪威卑尔根大学今年5月发布的一项大型研究将工作狂倾向与其他精神病问题关联起来，包括强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症。 工作成瘾 如果努力工作对你产生了负面影响该怎么办？哪些迹象能让人们确认自己“工作成瘾”？北卡罗来纳州精神治疗师布莱恩·罗宾逊（Bryan Robinson）表示，工作狂是一种强烈的冲动——它令人们难以摆脱工作的意愿和想法。罗宾逊曾经对工作成瘾的影响展开过早期研究，还写了一本名为《拴在办公桌上》（Chained to the Desk）的工作狂指导手册。 “工作狂不是根据工作时间来定义的，而是要考虑我们内心的想法。”他说。 “工作狂在滑雪时想着回去工作。而健康的人则是在工作时想着去滑雪。” 罗宾逊的客户里就有一些人因为长时间加班而离婚、失业或者遭遇健康问题。他回忆道，有一位客户曾经骗自己的丈夫说她在健身房，但她实际上却是在工作，之后再换上运动装，用水浸透全身，让自己看上去像是满身是汗。 Image caption 工作冲动强的人未必能比怀有健康态度的人绩效更高（图片来源：Getty Images） 你身边是否也有类似的人？ 但乔治亚大学的元分析显示，与其他同事相比，工作狂的业绩未必最好，在办公室里的活跃度也未必很高。 作为这项研究的负责人，乔治亚大学工业和组织心理学教授玛丽莎·克拉克（Malissa A Clark）表示，工作狂的职场压力更大，工作满意度和生活满意度更低，也更易疲惫。 危险信号 卑尔根工作成瘾量表（Bergen Work Addiction Scale）使用7项基本标准来判断工作成瘾的程度，每个标准有以下5个选项：（1）从不，（2）很少，（3）有时，（4）经常，（5）总是。如果在7项标准中至少有4项选择“经常”或“总是”，你可能就是工作狂。 你心想如何才能多腾出一些时间来工作。 你的实际工作时间远超最初的计划。 你为了降低负罪感、焦虑感、无助感和抑郁感而工作。 别人曾经建议你减少工作时间，但你却置之不理。 如果无法工作，你会感到紧张。你因为工作而放弃业余爱好、休闲活动和体育锻炼。 你工作量太大，甚至连身体健康都受到了负面影响。 Image caption 由于你无法立刻戒掉工作，所以必须制定一项计划，控制好自己与工作之间的关系（图片来源：Getty Images） 这些人的工作与生活之间的冲突更大，身体和心理健康度更低，包括婚姻在内的家庭关系也受到了不利影响。 她补充道，尽管工作狂经常与上进心、竞争欲、有野心和高效率联系在一起，但实际上，“积极影响并不多。” 评估与求助 如果你认为自己可能有问题，可以通过一些方法进行自我评估。 挪威研究人员制作的卑尔根工作成瘾量表可以帮助你对自己工作时的行为、感受和态度进行衡量。工作狂互戒会也会提供一份在线问卷，可以帮助你判断自己是否需要寻求帮助。 专家表示，第一步是承认自己有问题。 罗宾逊自称是一个处在恢复期的工作狂，他的治疗手段包括正念、心理治疗、改变行为和揭露根本问题。“这种情况存在一些根本原因。有的时候是自尊，有的时候是一种调节焦虑的方法。”他说。 Image caption （图片来源：Getty Images） 61岁的鲍勃承认他存在这方面的问题。妻子告诉他，她已经受够了现在的生活：她经常半夜醒来发现丈夫不在身边，而是在办公室里加班。鲍勃是工作狂互戒会的外联主任，这是一项志愿工作。为了避免别人暴露身份，他拒绝在这篇报道中使用自己的全名 “让工作狂上瘾的‘药物’就是肾上腺素。”他说，“紧张、压力、危机、最后期限，这都会使人兴奋，让人分泌肾上腺素，从而拼命地工作。” 鲍勃5岁时就开始工作了——帮助哥哥送报纸、回收易拉罐和玻璃瓶、修剪草坪、铲除积雪。他后来成了一名成功的商人，但健康状况却每况愈下。他表示，如果不向专业人士求助，他的家庭生活就会遭到破坏。他的妻子已经受够了这种生活。 “正是因为她受够了这样的生活，我才下定决心参加这个项目。”鲍勃说。 但跟吃饭一样，工作不可能一下子就完全放弃。既然如此，又该如何控制不停工作的冲动呢？“应该制定一份计划，然后按照计划行事，而不是随时强迫自己处理所有事情。”鲍勃说。这意味着要安排好工作时间，每次只能集中精力做一件事情。如果有其他事情突然出现，不能手忙脚乱地同时处理所有事情，而应该查看计划，并重新确定优先顺序。 其他的治疗方案还包括寻找精通这一领域的治疗师。或者，也可以参加门诊研讨会和门诊项目。而现在还出现了一些住院治疗项目，例如美国俄亥俄州的The Bridge To Recovery就计划为工作狂提供帮助，同时辅以强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症等方面的其他治疗。 但克拉克表示，目前的治疗方案之所以匮乏，主要原因是缺乏相关研究。“关于工作狂起因的研究本身就不多，而关于工作狂与临床症状相互关系的研究更是几乎没有。”挪威的研究算是其中之一。 她表示，现在需要进行更多的研究，“这样才能让这个问题变得更加主流，而不再是小众的流行词。这的确会对人们的生活和幸福构成明确的负面影响。” 访问 BBC Capital 阅读 英文原文。,{},"['caption',

Anonymous）效仿嗜酒者互戒会（Alcoholics Anonymous）的做法制定了12步法则，他们于今年6月在英国举行了首届国际大会，吸引了来自世界各地的与会者出席。关于工作狂的成因，目前还没有太多的相关研究。但这种现状正在改变——最近几年，这种现象开始获得更多关注，人们也不再仅仅把它当成一个流行词来看待。Image caption “工作狂”并不是一种正式的疾病——但它绝不仅仅是一个流行词（图片来源：Getty Images）美国精神病学协会的精神疾病诊断与统计手册是诊断精神疾病的黄金法则，但工作狂却并未被其认可为一种疾病。然而，尽管没有精确的定义，但工作狂对人们产生的影响却有可能与健康、职业和心理问题存在关联，而研究人员也在关注此事。乔治亚大学最近开展的元分析——对现有的工作狂研究文献展开定量总结——显示，与工作态度和工作方法更为健康的同事相比，工作狂的效率反而更低。挪威卑尔根大学今年5月发布的一项大型研究将工作狂倾向与其他精神病问题关联起来，包括强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症。工作成瘾如果努力工作对你产生了负面影响该怎么办？哪些迹象能让人们确认自己“工作成瘾”？北卡罗来纳州精神治疗师布莱恩·罗宾逊（Bryan Robinson）表示，工作狂是一种强烈的冲动——它令人们难以摆脱工作的意愿和想法。罗宾逊曾经对工作成瘾的影响展开过早期研究，还写了一本名为《拴在办公桌上》（Chained to the Desk）的工作狂指导手册。“工作狂不是根据工作时间来定义的，而是要考虑我们内心的想法。”他说。“工作狂在滑雪时想着回去工作。而健康的人则是在工作时想着去滑雪。”罗宾逊的客户里就有一些人因为长时间加班而离婚、失业或者遭遇健康问题。他回忆道，有一位客户曾经骗自己的丈夫说她在健身房，但她实际上却是在工作，之后再换上运动装，用水浸透全身，让自己看上去像是满身是汗。Image caption 工作冲动强的人未必能比怀有健康态度的人绩效更高（图片来源：Getty Images）你身边是否也有类似的人？但乔治亚大学的元分析显示，与其他同事相比，工作狂的业绩未必最好，在办公室里的活跃度也未必很高。作为这项研究的负责人，乔治亚大学工业和组织心理学教授玛丽莎·克拉克（Malissa A Clark）表示，工作狂的职场压力更大，工作满意度和生活满意度更低，也更易疲惫。危险信号卑尔根工作成瘾量表（Bergen Work Addiction Scale）使用7项基本标准来判断工作成瘾的程度，每个标准有以下5个选项：（1）从不，（2）很少，（3）有时，（4）经常，（5）总是。如果在7项标准中至少有4项选择“经常”或“总是”，你可能就是工作狂。你心想如何才能多腾出一些时间来工作。你的实际工作时间远超最初的计划。你为了降低负罪感、焦虑感、无助感和抑郁感而工作。别人曾经建议你减少工作时间，但你却置之不理。如果无法工作，你会感到紧张。你因为工作而放弃业余爱好、休闲活动和体育锻炼。你工作量太大，甚至连身体健康都受到了负面影响。Image caption 由于你无法立刻戒掉工作，所以必须制定一项计划，控制好自己与工作之间的关系（图片来源：Getty Images）这些人的工作与生活之间的冲突更大，身体和心理健康度更低，包括婚姻在内的家庭关系也受到了不利影响。她补充道，尽管工作狂经常与上进心、竞争欲、有野心和高效率联系在一起，但实际上，“积极影响并不多。”评估与求助如果你认为自己可能有问题，可以通过一些方法进行自我评估。挪威研究人员制作的卑尔根工作成瘾量表可以帮助你对自己工作时的行为、感受和态度进行衡量。工作狂互戒会也会提供一份在线问卷，可以帮助你判断自己是否需要寻求帮助。专家表示，第一步是承认自己有问题。罗宾逊自称是一个处在恢复期的工作狂，他的治疗手段包括正念、心理治疗、改变行为和揭露根本问题。“这种情况存在一些根本原因。有的时候是自尊，有的时候是一种调节焦虑的方法。”他说。Image caption （图片来源：Getty Images）61岁的鲍勃承认他存在这方面的问题。妻子告诉他，她已经受够了现在的生活：她经常半夜醒来发现丈夫不在身边，而是在办公室里加班。鲍勃是工作狂互戒会的外联主任，这是一项志愿工作。为了避免别人暴露身份，他拒绝在这篇报道中使用自己的全名“让工作狂上瘾的‘药物’就是肾上腺素。”他说，“紧张、压力、危机、最后期限，这都会使人兴奋，让人分泌肾上腺素，从而拼命地工作。”鲍勃5岁时就开始工作了——帮助哥哥送报纸、回收易拉罐和玻璃瓶、修剪草坪、铲除积雪。他后来成了一名成功的商人，但健康状况却每况愈下。他表示，如果不向专业人士求助，他的家庭生活就会遭到破坏。他的妻子已经受够了这种生活。“正是因为她受够了这样的生活，我才下定决心参加这个项目。”鲍勃说。但跟吃饭一样，工作不可能一下子就完全放弃。既然如此，又该如何控制不停工作的冲动呢？“应该制定一份计划，然后按照计划行事，而不是随时强迫自己处理所有事情。”鲍勃说。这意味着要安排好工作时间，每次只能集中精力做一件事情。如果有其他事情突然出现，不能手忙脚乱地同时处理所有事情，而应该查看计划，并重新确定优先顺序。其他的治疗方案还包括寻找精通这一领域的治疗师。或者，也可以参加门诊研讨会和门诊项目。而现在还出现了一些住院治疗项目，例如美国俄亥俄州的The Bridge To Recovery就计划为工作狂提供帮助，同时辅以强迫症、焦虑症和抑郁症等方面的其他治疗。但克拉克表示，目前的治疗方案之所以匮乏，主要原因是缺乏相关研究。“关于工作狂起因的研究本身就不多，而关于工作狂与临床症状相互关系的研究更是几乎没有。”挪威的研究算是其中之一。她表示，现在需要进行更多的研究，“这样才能让这个问题变得更加主流，而不再是小众的流行词。这的确会对人们的生活和幸福构成明确的负面影响。”访问

Former alcoholic 'scared' by rise in young drinkers,"A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems.",,30 December 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is scared by the rise in the number of young drinkers A recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group. Patrick Martin, 64, once drank a litre of vodka a day at the height of his alcohol addiction. Mr Martin, who has been sober for three years, has lost two partners to alcohol-related illnesses. Now he is worried by the rise in the number of young people at his Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. ""We are getting more young people at meetings, particularly young women,"" he said. ""They are getting really ill through drinking and it scares me for future generations. ""My heart goes out to them. I wish I could tell them what Ive been through."" Wallowed in sadness Mr Martin, who lives in Norwich, said he has seen a sharp rise in young people aged between 22 to 28 coming to the group. I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness Patrick Martin Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show the rate of alcohol-related deaths for 15 to 34-year-olds in the UK has almost doubled in nearly 20 years. In 1991, 137 young people aged between 15 and 34 died of alcohol-related problems. Of those, 48 were women. By 2009, the total number of alcohol-related deaths had risen to 261, of which 94 were women. ""The stories we hear from these young people are harrowing to say the least,"" Mr Martin said. ""They let their hair down at weekends but these weekends tend to get out of hand for a lot of them."" Mr Martin said his drink problem started to escalate in his late 20s, when he drank as a way to escape the pressure he felt in his work as a pottery designer. At the height of his addiction, Mr Martin said would sometimes go without eating for two weeks when on a drinking binge. ""I just locked the door, drew the curtains, pulled the telephone wire out and just wallowed in my own sadness,"" he said. ""When you are drinking, your only thoughts from the moment you wake up until the moment you pass out is where you can get your next drink from. Nothing else matters."" Rock bottom Mr Martin said his alcohol problem has shortened his life and robbed him of his marriage and his relationship with his son. Two former partners have also died of alcohol-related illnesses in the past six years, he added. Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous for almost 30 years, Mr Martin said he decided to stop drinking quite suddenly three-and-a-half years ago. ""I just put the drink down one day,"" he said. ""I had reached my rock bottom and climbed back up but a lot of people dont."" Mr Martin, who has now retired for health reasons, is calling for better education to help stem the rising tide of young drinkers. ""You are not going to stop people drinking by putting alcohol prices up,"" he said. ""If you are desperate for alcohol, you will steal to get it. ""I dont think the health services or Government take the problem seriously enough or realise how serious it will be in a few years. ""If they carry on drinking, a lot of these young people will be in the same boat as me in 10 years time.""",{},"['young', 'scared', 'alcoholrelated', 'alcoholic', 'alcohol', 'rise', 'drinkers', 'mr', 'number', 'martin', 'drinking', 'problem', 'drink']","Image caption Recovering alcoholic Patrick Martin is 'scared' by the rise in the number of young drinkersA recovering alcoholic from Norfolk says he is ""scared"" by the rise in the number of young people with drink problems at his support group.

Activities offer hope to recovering addicts,People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night.,,3 March 2011,BBC News,"Image caption More than 70 people have contacted AGRO at Holyhead and Bangor since last September People recovering from drug and alcohol addiction in Gwynedd and Anglesey have been boosted by a new charity which offers support day and night. The Anglesey and Gwynedd Recovery Organisation (AGRO) uses activities like gardening and group sessions to support people in their bid to give up drink and drugs. More than 70 people have already approached AGROs Holyhead and Bangor groups for help since it was set up last September, just through word of mouth recommendation. Its founders are now starting to publicise their work and have secured funding from the Safer Anglesey and Gwynedd partnerships to set up groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon. Huw Harries, who is a support worker for the dug and alcohol rehabilitation organisation CAIS by day, co-founded the charity in his spare time using his own funds. Image caption AGRO hope to soon launch groups in Amlwch, Llangefni and Caernarfon As a former alcoholic himself, Huw feels able to reach out to those who are also fighting to get sober. He said: ""I havent had a drink in 15 years. I used to be a nightclub manager and I suppose Im on the other side of the fence now. ""I gave up because my wife gave me an ultimatum, saying shed go back to Scotland if I didnt. Im so glad I did because she died of cancer two years later and I was able to nurse her with a clear head."" But after working for CAIS for eight years, Huw realised that those in need had nowhere to turn to in the evenings or weekends. Now AGRO offer 24-hour phone support to help an addict avoid having another drink or talk them through a period of anxiety. But AGROs other aim is to help people to recover through getting involved in new activities. They have already turned a piece of Holyhead waste ground into a productive vegetable garden and have future plans to acquire more allotments and open a shop to sell their produce. They will plough any profit back into the community. They also organise walks, kayaking sessions and fishing at weekends to help people get active and have something else to think about. ""It gives people something else to do when they come out of rehab after three or six months,"" explained Huw. ""And people really want to do it. It isnt often you have alcohol and drug addicts working on something together."" He was spurred on to start the groups on Anglesey after figures suggested more people from the island were admitted into Bangors Ysbyty Gwynedd with alcohol-related problems than from anywhere in Gwynedd. But from small beginnings, he see big demand for AGROs work. ""We have all sorts of members,"" said Huw. ""Students, people who own their own businesses, housewives, unemployed people. ""The days of people drinking all day havent completely gone, but mostly now people binge-drink when they get stressed, or have a glass or two, or a bottle every night. ""And the price of alcohol doesnt matter. If you want a drink youll get it, even if there are no buses and you have to walk a long way. ""Its easier to get some alcohol than call a doctor for help at night."" Although Huw is happy to help those who want to recover, he thinks that educating those who are yet to find themselves in trouble is ultimately the way forward. ""We want to go into schools or go to the WI to educate people about the side-effects of alcohol,"" he said. ""If you catch people early enough, then youll avoid spending money on A&E or on unemployment, divorce or sorting out the effect on the kids."" ""Ive seen the suffering it can cause and want to help people early on.""

Bromsgrove alcohol ban woman Laura Hall's no drink vow,The first person to be banned from buying alcohol in pubs and off-licences in England and Wales vows to stop drinking.,,25 May 2010,BBC News,"The first person to be banned from buying alcohol in pubs and off-licences in England and Wales has finally vowed to stop drinking. Laura Hall, from Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, has 38 convictions for alcohol-related offences, mainly for being drunk and disorderly. She was arrested for the second time in two weeks on Friday for being drunk and disorderly. The unemployed 20-year-old said she really wanted to give up drinking now. Miss Hall was given a drinking banning order (DBO) in April prohibiting her from drinking in public or buying alcohol from licenced premises for two years. She was also banned from entering pubs, bars or off-licences. She admitted to breaching the DBO and being drunk and disorderly on 16 May after being spotted by police sitting on a wall outside a Bromsgrove nightclub holding a can of beer. She was fined £100 and required to pay £85 in legal fees and a £15 victims surcharge. It was a binge Five days later she was drunk in public after consuming a bottle of wine, a 70cl (1.2pint) bottle of vodka and several cans of lager. She told BBC News the alcohol ban was actually leading her to drink more. She said: ""The drinking bans wrecking my life. ""Even if I had soft drinks I cant go clubbing or go to the pub with my friends. ""It means I have to go to peoples houses and I probably end up drinking more alcohol there because its cheaper than buying drinks out. ""I do want to stop, but obviously its not going to happen overnight."" Her latest run-in with the law came last week. She told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Id been out at my friends house just having a drink as you do on a Friday night. ""I say a few, it was a binge. ""We went to a 24-hour-garage and my friend bought the beers. ""After that it was a bit of a blur. ""There was some commotion involving an ambulance and I was being abusive."" Miss Hall, who was arrested for causing criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly, was given a six-month supervision order by Redditch magistrates on Monday. Police said if she was arrested again they would seek an anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) which would carry a prison sentence if breached. Miss Hall, who lives at home with her 17-year-old twin sisters, said she was trying to cut down her drinking and said she was third on a waiting list for an alcohol abuse course to help her to quit. She said she had also referred herself to Worcestershire Community Alcohol Team and had been given an appointment for next week. I cant remember stuff the morning after the night before Laura Hall ""My friends tell me to cut down, they do get sick of it when I cross the line. Its not up to them to stop me, Im my own person I will take responsibility for that,"" she said. She said she did not ""go out with the intention of getting arrested"" but alcohol made her abusive and she tended to lash out at the police as a rule. She said drinking was her first spending priority out of her weekly unemployment benefits. ""I am really worried, I cant remember stuff the morning after the night before. ""A lot of people think Im not bothered...but I know I want to change,"" she added.",{},"['hall', 'buying', 'given', 'bromsgrove', 'stop', 'order', 'halls', 'alcohol', 'woman', 'laura', 'ban', 'arrested', 'cant', 'drunk', 'drinking', 'vow', 'drink']","The first person to be banned from buying alcohol in pubs and off-licences in England and Wales has finally vowed to stop drinking.

'Take my brain out': The artists awakened by brain injuries,"Thirty artists are exhibiting their work, many for the first time. The collective has only one thing in common - they all survived severe brain injuries.",,7 December 2016,BBC News,"Image copyright Phil Thirty extraordinary artists who survived brain injuries, but found a new craft, are exhibiting their work in London this month, many for the first time. For five days a week the art studio at Headway East London, set within a railway arch in Hackney, comes to life with people acquiring new skills and producing artwork. Many had shown little or no interest in art until they were injured and invited into the studio. Each member of Headway East London acquired their injuries as an adult. Some as a result of violent assaults, car crashes or meningitis, while others are from less common causes including hypoxia - a suffocation injury. Ben Graham from the Headway charity says: ""Quite a few of the people were tending to see cant do their former jobs, or their relationships have broken down or maybe theyre the parent but need caring for themselves. Sandra Lott worked in banking in the City of London and would often travel to Europe and America on business. She suffered head trauma in 2013. The resulting injury means she walks with a stick, has cognitive fatigue and aphasia - a communication disorder. Image copyright Headway East London ""When I was at work, I fell over and security got me to the hospital. I was there for three days and then I was okay, but then I fell over on the stairs. Me and my friend we just had a coffee. I was walking around Liverpool Street and there were loads of steps, and thats when I fell on them. ""I was sick for a year. But then, when I came to Headway I just loved it."" Sandra enjoyed art as a child, but gave up as a teenager. One of the pieces she is exhibiting, Witches and Buildings, was inspired by 9/11. She had been working in New York shortly before. Image copyright Sandra Lott ""I had crabs and lizards and there was a man who was going into a helicopter - they were helping them after the World Trade Centre. That was because three weeks before, I went to the city. All the people who died, it was awful."" Sandra says her family has been very supportive of her art. ""My husbands going to come to the exhibition. He loves it. My husband is a photographer. I used to help him. I think in 2017 I would like to help his photography - I really want to do it."" Headway East London started in 1997 with one therapist and a single client. Its since grown and offers a variety of services. Rather than short-term rehabilitation with a discharge date it hopes to offer support as long as is needed; helping to redefine the person and giving them a positive outlook and productive use of their time. Many of the 40 members who use the studio now consider art their job. Graham says ""Therapy is about making yourself better, but what theyre doing is about making something, selling it to people, engaging with the public and forming an identity they feel comfortable and happy with. Image copyright Headway East London ""Essentially theyre no longer unemployed, which affects their self-worth, and gives people that root to self-expression."" Headway is based in a unit complete with a kitchen, gym and therapy rooms with the Submit To Love Studio next door providing a bespoke space for painting, sculpting and ceramics. When it first opened Graham says it led to an ""explosion"" of artwork and an ""astonishing uptake"" which they hope to continue nurturing. Nick Mayers, 56, had spent 16 years in the Parachute Regiment before he had two strokes in one year. The second resulted in a haemorrhage which has affected his speech, memory and mobility. Nick will often paint images he sees in books. Image copyright Nick Mayers ""I was born, Nicholas Mayers. I was born 4th January, Battersea Park. When I was four-years-old I first started to paint."" Nicks strokes meant he has had to teach himself how to draw using his left hand, despite having grown up right-handed."" For anyone thinking of taking up art Nick has some advice: ""Make it up as you go along. When I finish painting I never look back. Dont get attached."" Some of the artists have exhibited before but for many it will be the first time the public has a chance to see and buy the pieces with any profits split 50/50 between the artist and charity. Image copyright Nick Mayers Graham says Headway East London is ""not in a hurry to make it a commercial enterprise"" but already prices have increased. Drawings used to go for about £20, but one artist has sold a piece for £1,600 and has a further eight chosen for £2,400. ""I dont think financial gain is the priority. Feeling valuable and engaged and pursuing something meaningful to them is the most important thing, and in a setting where theyre connecting with others,"" Graham says. ""Theyre doing art for its own sake. Its a really exciting time for us and we all share that sense of pride together as a community."" Phil, a 44 year old father-of-two, was a pedestrian in a road traffic accident in 2015. He has problems with physical and cognitive fatigue, memory and concentration. Image copyright Phil ""I used to draw for my kids. I suppose I did have an eye but it didnt connect to how I would normally do things. ""I was really confused that I couldnt draw a line. Before the accident I would have been fine."" He said he struggled at first spending whole days working on it before declaring ""Ive failed"" but after taking a more relaxed approach art has become his release. ""The piece Im doing now - its massive. Its a painting collage. Its a bit to do with me - the dark to the light. I think its like my journey of this accident."" Image copyright Brian Searle He says before he started at Headway he wasnt sure what to expect. ""People think its like AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] - where you sit around in a circle and give out your feelings. This is totally different. This is my space from 10 til 3, I take my brain out and recharge it. ""Its a wonderful place to recharge my brain and Im allowed to be myself.""

Describing the experience as the ""lowest of the low"", the 49-year-old actress and businesswoman said she did not know who to trust. In 2003, she had a breakdown and went into hospital, which was a ""terrible"" incident but ended up in the papers. Ms Frost is among eight high-profile figures claiming damages for hacking. She told the court: ""Your father is dying, you are going through divorce, you have postnatal depression, you are in and out of hospital, my baby was ill, he was born premature. ""I was at breaking point, I could not sleep, or eat, and I did not know who to trust as information kept getting into the media. ""I needed my loved ones around me. I was very upset, I was a very, very unhappy person. ""Every time I turned to someone to confide in them, it ended up in the newspapers, which added to my distress and trauma."" ""I couldnt go and sit with my mum and have a cup of tea because I thought she was selling stories. I didnt trust my own mother."" Panic attacks Ms Frost said her separation from fellow actor Jude Law was very difficult. ""I thought it might be Jude, trying to make me look bad for custody reasons, or my friends or family using me for their own gains. Either thought was heartbreaking. ""This was a deeply stressful time in my life and the fact my insecurities were being publicised obviously made it worse."" She described how friends, particularly model Kate Moss, questioned whether they could trust her. ""Even worse than that, Jude, the father of my children, thought for years that I was selling stories which created an animosity between us that has only really disappeared since the revelations about phone hacking."" Image caption Sadie Frost said she was humiliated when a story emerged about her attending an AA meeting Ms Frost said: ""I couldnt take my youngest son to the park for two years because he was photographed. He would cry and I would get panic attacks. ""I lost two to three years of my life, they wanted me to fail.

She said she had been advised to go a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous ""because it was a safe place"". ""Someone quite high-profile took me there and I went there after everyone said it would be safe and anonymous,"" she told the court. ""I was portrayed as troubled, sad, as a party-girl.

The Indian Supreme Courts 2013 decision to reverse a lower court order striking down a 153-year-old British colonial-era law criminalising homosexual acts caused global outrage with many describing it as ""disgraceful"". According to Section 377 of the law, a same-sex relationship is an ""unnatural offence"" and punishable by a 10-year jail term. A BBC correspondent in Delhi says although the law has rarely - if ever - been used to prosecute anyone for consensual sex, it has often been used by the police to harass homosexuals. Also, in deeply conservative India, homosexuality is a taboo and many people still regard same-sex relationships as illegitimate and our correspondent says Mr Tawadkars comment is an endorsement of that conservative thought. ""We will make LGBT [lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth normal. We will have a centre for them... like Alcoholics Anonymous centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" Mr Tawadkar said on Monday while discussing the Bharatiya Janata Party-run state governments policy report on youth. ""As in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out of the LGBT community so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" the minister added. The ministers statement has led to outrage in India with many people condemning it on social media sites like Twitter.

""I am proud to stand for the equality of all people - including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,"" the UN chief said in a statement late on Monday. ""I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination.

Funeral of Clarissa Dickson Wright takes place in Edinburgh,The funeral of celebrated television cook Clarissa Dickson Wright takes place in Edinburgh.,,7 April 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright PA Image caption A red chilli and artichoke wreath reflected Dickson Wrights flamboyant nature The funeral of celebrated television cook Clarissa Dickson Wright has taken place in Edinburgh. The 66-year-old, who found fame as one of the Two Fat Ladies, died in the city on 15 March. Friends and relatives attended a service at the citys St Marys Metropolitan Cathedral, followed by a private cremation. As a food writer and broadcaster, Dickson Wright was known for her frank manner and strong opinions. Mass of contradictions Her love of food was highlighted at the funeral with an unusual wreath including red chillies and artichokes on top of her coffin. Born in London, she trained as a barrister and was the youngest woman ever to be called to the Bar at the time. Alcohol addiction put an end to her legal career but in the mid 1990s she was spotted by a TV producer while working in an Edinburgh cookery shop. Image caption Clarissa Dickson Wright fronted Two Fat Ladies and several solo TV shows Teamed with the late Jennifer Paterson, the duo travelled around in a motorbike and sidecar, creating feasts as well as a hit BBC 2 series. Delivering a eulogy, the Very Rev Monsignor Michael Regan said: ""Through her education and upbringing she proved herself to be a brilliant woman and her career seemed destined for greatness but she had the self-destruct mechanism of so many gifted people and her downward spiral is well known. ""But from that downward spiral where she found herself homeless and penniless she learned a sympathy with others that stayed with her and through her association with Alcoholics Anonymous she found and gave strength to others."" She was a ""mass of contradictions"", he added. A piper played outside the city centre church as her coffin was carried at the front of grieving family and friends. Dickson Wright also appeared in other shows, including Clarissa and the Countryman and Clarissa and the Kings Cookbook, and served as rector of Aberdeen University.

Thousands of dangerous drink-drivers are reoffenders,"Almost one in five motorists listed on an official register of the most dangerous drink-drivers has been on it before, the BBC learns through a Freedom of Information request.",,27 September 2013,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anish Patel, whose wife was killed by a drink driver: ""Something has to be done"" As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders. A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before. There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences. The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent. Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"". Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLAs scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before. Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired. But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent. However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence. Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754. Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined. Bitter experience Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"". He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem. ""I suspect from the people that Ive dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it wont effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent."" In 2009, Anish Patels wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London. Image caption The driver of this lorry who killed Catriona Patel had been on a drinking binge the night before. He was jailed for seven years. The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving. Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together."" He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the drivers previous convictions. ""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldnt have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London. ""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. "" Get carried away Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks. He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again. He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably Id end up drink-driving. ""Im not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? Youre going to lose your liberty, youre going to lose your job, youre going to lose your home. Youre going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving."" Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests. ""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently. ""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it."" Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road. ""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive.""

Can a parent save their child from addiction?,The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. The struggles of Mitch and Janis Winehouse to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of couples up and down the country.,,26 July 2011,BBC News,"Image caption In the film Trainspotting, Renton (Ewan McGregor) is put through ""cold turkey"" by his parents The death of Amy Winehouse has once again highlighted the danger of drink and drug addiction. Mitch and Janis Winehouses battles to cure their daughter of her addiction are shared by thousands of parents up and down the country. Many parents reading of the death at the weekend of singer Amy Winehouse will have thought to themselves: ""What would I do if my son or daughter was an addict?"" Some people, like Tom Methven, know only too well what they would do and whether it would work. His son, Jason, 29, is an alcoholic. Mr Methven, from Surrey, said: ""When I heard about Amy Winehouse I thought, Its finally got her. Slave to the addiction ""Drugs and alcohol damage a receptor in the brain. You become a slave. Why else would she have kept taking it? She was a very similar age to my son."" Hannah Meredith was 17 when she died of a heroin overdose in October 2009. Image caption Teenager Hannah Meredith wrote a ""letter to heroin"" a month before her death in 2009 A month before she died, she wrote a ""letter to heroin"". Her aunt, Lisa Moore, read out excerpts from the letter on BBC Radio Five Live last year. Ms Moore told the BBC: ""It takes years to recover but it only takes seconds to relapse."" She said: ""We heard about Amy Winehouses death on Saturday and it brought back feelings of what happened to Hannah. It was two years ago, but its still raw."" Ms Moore said: ""Ive read stuff on Facebook about Amy like one less junkie, and it is so ignorant and insensitive. Families feel helpless, they feel like failures, they think, How can we fix it when that person is choosing to do it?"" ""What people dont realise is that no matter how badly someone is on drugs nothing ever prepares you for the knock on the door or the phone call, nothing prepares you for their death."" She said Hannah had been given an ecstasy tablet on her 14th birthday, ""liked the feeling"" and by the age of 15 was on heroin. Two years later she was ""clean"" but then had her fatal relapse. ""She had been in recovery for four months and was sure she was in control of heroin. She might have thought she would try it one more time,"" said Ms Moore. Both Ms Moore and Mr Methven said there was a lot of ignorance about substance abuse. Tough love They said many people thought they could just lock their son or daughter in a room and make them go ""cold turkey"" - completely denying them drink or drugs - to exorcise their demons. The cold turkey scene has cropped up in films like Trainspotting and soap operas like EastEnders, where a parent uses so-called ""tough love"". But Mr Methven says the reality is that it very rarely works. He has tried almost everything to rescue his son from his alcoholism: Rehab - two sessions in a £500-a-day private clinic. Medication - Antabuse, or disulfiram, a tablet which makes the taker sick if he or she drinks alcohol. Sectioning - a compulsory week in a mental health unit. Psychiatry - several sessions with a top specialist. Image caption Mitch and Janis Winehouse had to deal with their daughters addiction amid the publics gaze At his worst point Jason, who weighs 19 stone (120kg), was drinking huge quantities of vodka and would become violent and aggressive. ""One time he smashed a piece of glass at his girlfriends house and cut an artery. I had to follow the trail of blood to find him. They broke up about a month later. She couldnt cope with it,"" said Mr Methven. He said: ""Another time he was self-harming. He burned himself with an iron and was then banging his head against a table. ""He tried to cut his wrists once with a knife. The police were called and he was taken to hospital. ""He was so drunk he was fighting with the security guards and he got one of them, a big guy, on the floor. Eventually he was given a very strong tranquilliser."" Mr Methven said his son, who is an only child, had a normal childhood and was very intelligent. He went to university and got a first with honours before embarking on a PhD. Out of control But his drinking, which had started as a teenager, got out of control and he never completed it. Jason is now unemployed and gets £20 a week in Disability Living Allowance. ""That is supposed to be given to his mum for laundry and shopping but it is in many respects money for alcohol,"" said his father. Mr Methven said: ""He was about 24 when we realised he had a real problem. We went to the doctor and got a referral. ""We wanted to get him into rehab but it took so long on the NHS that we panicked and went private."" Jason has been into rehab twice. There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it John Methven, Father of an alcoholic On one occasion Mr Methven spent £18,000 and he said: ""Before the cheque was even dry he was back on the drink."" He said: ""There is no alcohol in the house now. I used to have some good-quality wine. It was very well hid. I was going to give it to a friend as a present but it was gone. He had drunk it."" Mr Methven said his son had stolen money from him and his wife and had also taken DVDs and other property and sold it at cash converter shops to provide drinking money. Secretive drinking ""Its always secretive drinking. He doesnt go to the pub. He just drinks in his room. He hid it in rucksacks or under the hedge in the garden,"" he said. Jason has now joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has a sponsor, but he is still drinking. ""He is trying to take it down. Yesterday he had six cans (of beer) and today its four. He is still drinking but its far less,"" said Mr Methven. But he said the crucial thing was that Jason has now said he wants to stop. Image caption Nicholas Mills (pictured) hanged himself after a drug-fuelled argument but his twin brother survived and is now clean ""If they are going to get well they have got to go to AA or NA (Narcotics Anonymous). The individual is powerless, but collectively they can do it. Its a spiritual thing. AA is about giving it up altogether. ""Once you are an alcoholic or an addict one is too many and 100 is not enough."" Asked how he feels about his son now, he said: ""Its not so much shame as disappointment about what he could have done with his life."" While Mr Methven can understand the addiction, Elizabeth Burton-Phillips knows the heartbreak of what she calls the ""double whammy"" of addiction and death. Her twin sons, Nicholas and Simon, both became heroin addicts. Nicholas died in 2004 but Simon survived and has kicked the habit. Mrs Burton-Phillips, from Buckinghamshire, has since set up a charity, DrugFam, and she told the BBC: ""We are trying to help families who are struggling to cope with the addiction of their loved ones, like Amy and my son."" She said she met Amys mother in 2008 and added: ""I have been in text contact with her since Amy passed and they are obviously going to be terribly badly affected."" Mrs Burton-Phillips travelled to Llanelli on Monday to give her moral support to the Hannah Meredith Foundation, which launched a support group for the families of those in the Carmarthenshire area coping with substance abuse. Anyone wanting to contact the foundation should do so through their Facebook page.

He died just before Christmas last year, aged 59. But Charlotte, 27, tells Newsbeat she feels like she lost him to alcohol addiction years ago. ""In your teenage years you become more aware of your parents behaviour,"" she says. ""Id realise that finding bottles of wine hidden behind the sofa isnt normal.

""It was a slow deterioration. Every time he felt positive you really wanted to get behind him and support him, which is what he needed.. Ill have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories ""But the more it happened and the more he failed, it became difficult to put that aside. ""He was living two lives because until I was 18 it didnt really come out that he was an alcoholic ""He hid very well that he wasnt paying the mortgage [on our house]. ""It came out that we were really close to losing the house. We had bailiffs knocking on the door. ""I was working in the village pub and youd often be told stories like Charlotte, I saw your dad passed out on the path and I almost tripped over him. ""Its quite an embarrassing illness for your parent to have because they lose their inhibitions and dont care what people think of them."" Daddys girl ""I was a proper daddys girl. We were very close. Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just dont need it. ""I have so many nice memories of him. Ill have days when I remember the nice things, and then there are days when I have the horrible memories and I think of him drunk, and I think of him not able to stop for us. ""Its a mixed bag of emotions because you have the anger that he did this to himself."" Role reversal ""It was a role reversal because you end up looking out for him and making sure he gets ready for the day. And then always worrying about what he was doing. ""Your teenage years are difficult enough. To have that as an extra worry, you just dont need it.

Drinkers 'ignorant' about alcohol,,,2008-05-19 01:31:20,,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Three-quarters of drinkers do not know a typical glass of wine contains three units of alcohol, a survey for the Department of Health suggests. The YouGov survey of 1,429 drinkers in England found more than a third did not know their recommended daily limit - 2-3 units for women and 3-4 for men. The survey coincides with a government campaign to promote careful drinking. Ministers are concerned people are unaware that glass sizes have increased and some drinks have become stronger. The internet survey found half those questioned drank alcohol at least two or three times a week. And although 82% said they knew what a unit of alcohol was, 77% did not know how many units were in a typical large glass of wine. GPs are used to hearing half truths about half measures - people need to have a better grasp of how much theyre drinking by adding up their units Professor Steve Field, Royal College of GPs Alcohol units Drinking diaries More than half (55%) thought a large glass of wine would contain two units, when it actually contains three. Nearly three out of five (58%) did not know a double gin and tonic contains two units. More than a third (35%) did not know that an average pint of beer (ABV 4%) contains more than two units - although some strong lagers contain three units. And 36% of women and 50% of men knew their recommended daily drinking limits were 2-3 units and 3-4 units respectively. The Office of National Statistics revamped its assessment method to take into account the increased glass sizes and strength of alcoholic drinks last December. Ordinary families The Know Your Limits campaign aims to tell drinkers how many units are now in their drinks and help them stick to their recommended limits. Some lagers contain three units There is a series of new adverts on television, radio and newspapers showing the number of units in individual drinks. The adverts use ordinary family situations to help people understand how many units are in typical alcoholic drinks and warns them how too much regular drinking can damage their health. Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said people are not necessarily aware of how much they drink and how much it can harm their health. ""Glass sizes have grown larger and the strength of many wines and beers has increased, so its no wonder some of us have lost track of our alcohol consumption. ""We aim to give people the facts about how many units are in different drinks in a non-judgemental way. Then they can then make their own assessments about how much they want to drink in the future."" Older drinkers Mrs Primarolo said the campaign was aimed at over 25s who were less aware of what a unit was than younger people. Some 32% of drinkers aged 18-24 correctly said that a large glass of wine contains three units, compared with just 18% of drinkers over 55. Royal College of General Practitioners chairman Professor Steve Field said: ""When it comes to alcohol GPs are used to hearing half truths about half measures. HAVE YOUR SAY I dont have a clue how many units are in most drinks, but I do know when I have had enough Joe Delaney, London ""People need to have a better grasp of how much theyre drinking by adding up their units. ""Alcohol can be a major contributing factor in many health disorders so its vital that people think about how much alcohol they drink,"" he said. Joe Korner, from The Stroke Association, said the organisation fully supports efforts to make people aware of the health risks associated with excessive drinking. ""There are around 1,100 haemorrhagic stroke deaths every year associated with alcohol and statistics show that women who drink over double their recommended limits are more than four times likely to suffer a stroke, and men almost twice as likely,"" he said. Mark Hastings, of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: ""We fully support the aim of giving people information on which to make their own decisions. ""But the government needs to be careful not to target the sensible majority while failing to tackle abuse by the minority. ""What people need is realistic advice and sensible action, not interference with their own judgement.""

Food addiction: could overeating be compulsive?,Alcoholism researcher Sally Marlow examines whether food addiction could be fuelling a rise in obesity,,30 April 2013,BBC News,"Image copyright Science Photo Library Scientists are divided over whether or not addiction could be contributing to rising global obesity. Does food addiction really exist and - if it does - how can it be treated? Getting a grip on addiction can be incredibly hard, as anyone who has ever tried to give up smoking, alcohol or even caffeine will testify. A tried and tested tactic is to avoid the thing youre addicted to - giving up going to pubs for a while, or not to have cigarettes in the house. Even with these measures people often struggle and fail repeatedly. But what if the thing you are addicted to has to be kept in the house, and worse, has to be something you sit down in front of three times a day? As obesity levels continue to rise, the scientific community is starting to look for similarities between overeating and addiction. The EU has funded a project called NeuroFAST to bring all the evidence together. About the author Sally Marlow is an alcohol addiction researcher at the Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College London. She has reported on alcohol for Radio 4s Today programme and for Inside Health Researchers are cautious. So far there is only one type of eating disorder where it is thought addiction plays a role: Binge Eating Disorder, a side effect of which is often obesity. Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip. It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction. One of the people I spoke to as part of my research, Michael, is an articulate, educated professional and a former overeater. He said: ""Its difficult for others to understand. Everyone overeats and they think its just a bigger version of that. ""Its a completely different experience - a constant, daily minute-to-minute obsession about getting the substance, food. ""It is hell being there in that place."" Louise, another of those I met, provides a compelling testimony for addiction being at work in overeating. She also had a serious alcohol problem and understands addiction more than most. ""I think whats most interesting is the similarities in behaviour,"" she says. What is Binge Eating Disorder? A feeling of compulsion to overeat on a regular basis, sometimes including pre-planned binges Those affected consume large amounts of food in a short time, often when they are not hungry Overeating usually happens in private, leaving the person feeling out of control or guilty The disorder is linked to obesity and conditions like high blood pressure and heart disease Treatments include anti-depressants and cognitive therapies Source: NHS ""As an alcoholic I would go to different off-licences to buy my alcohol so people wouldnt recognise me, but Id also go to different newsagents to buy chocolate so they wouldnt recognise me. ""Sneaking it into the house, not wanting people to see, hiding food, like an alcoholic hiding bottles, hiding empties."" Dr Nora Volkow, a prominent neuroscientist and head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States, is clear in her mind that there are biological processes underpinning what Michael and Louise describe. She has found that a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is known to be involved in addiction, behaves in the brain in the same way in those who are heavily addicted to drugs and those who are obese. For her this is strong evidence that food, or eating, can be addictive. Not everybody agrees. Professor Jane Ogden, a psychologist at the University of Surrey, believes the label of addiction can be unhelpful for those who overeat - it removes personal responsibility and hinders recovery. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The number of obese people in the UK has more than trebled in 25 years ""The addiction world has given us a strong narrative that says you have no control - things in your brain are wanting more sugar or chocolate"" she says. But if food is like other addictions, we should theoretically see overlaps in successful treatments. Addiction treatment has a goal of either complete abstinence or reducing harm - for example by prescribing methadone or nicotine gum. For those working towards abstinence, one tried and tested model is the 12-step programme developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, with versions for drugs used by Narcotics Anonymous and gambling by Gamblers Anonymous. Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea Michael and Louise are both members of Overeaters Anonymous. It works in much the same way as the other 12-step programmes with peer-led group confidential meetings, personal mentors, and a structured programme of steps to work through. There is no doubt that for some its highly successful, just like Alcoholics Anonymous can be. Its not possible to abstain from eating, of course, but it is possible to abstain from overeating. For Louise, abstinence is three healthy meals a day, no wheat and no chocolate. For Michael his abstinence food plan is determined by his sponsor - he is told by someone else what he is allowed to eat. Other treatments are more radical. In alcohol addiction, the body can be altered so that it rejects alcohol by implanting a drug known as antabuse. If alcohol is consumed, the body reacts with nausea. Similarly in overeating, the body can be altered by bariatric surgery - a gastric band, bypass or sleeve, which restricts the volume of the stomach available for food. It sounds extreme but it works for most people, and the evidence shows the risks of surgery are far outweighed by the health benefits of losing excess weight. People live longer, and have fewer heart and mobility problems. Diabetes is even reversed in some cases, and people report a massively improved quality of life. The possible relationships between food and addiction are incredibly complicated, and there is a lot we do not yet understand. Twenty years ago people were reluctant to accept that gambling could be addictive, but now there is widespread acceptance of this idea, and good evidence to support it. Are we at the same place with food - waiting for the evidence and attitudes to change? Nicola Schlesinger, a counsellor, works with women who have addiction problems and eating disorders. What would she say to those scientists who do not believe food can be addictive? ""They dont necessarily have the people sitting in front of them that I have on a daily basis in tears, in pain, hating themselves, feeling suicidal,"" she says. ""They can say what they like but in the end we still have to deal with the reality of the situation as it presents itself."" Hopefully NeuroFAST and others will move us closer to narrowing the gap between scientists on both sides of the debate, and find solutions for people who do feel a compulsion to overeat.

Quantified self: The tech-based route to a better life?,"Self-improvement has never been easier, thanks to apps and devices that measure all your everyday activities. But can you count your way to better health?",Karen Weintraub,2013-01-02 00:00:00,,"Another New Year, another list of resolutions to make… and no doubt break. For some, 2013 may begin by going to the gym, or giving up smoking. But what about a more thorough and personal approach towards self-improvement, like monitoring your thoughts, e-mails, or even your bowel movements? If the answer is yes, then perhaps this is the year that you’ll be joining a growing group of people who are using technology to measure their lives in extraordinary detail. Probably since the dawn of humanity, people have been fascinated by even the most minute details of their lives, and kept track of what was going on in their bodies and minds. The Roman philosopher Seneca tracked the food he ate and what he dreamt at night. Benjamin Franklin consistently recorded his performance on 13 measures, such as cleanliness, frugality and overindulgence, believing it would keep him virtuous. Engineer and architect Buckminster Fuller nicknamed himself “guinea pig b” and kept a diary on his daily life and ideas. But in the past, record-keeping was time-consuming, requiring a commitment that only a very few had the patience to muster. Others cared, but not THAT much. Today, that’s changing, as it becomes easier to track everything, from diet to mood to sleep quality. Smartphones come equipped with features like GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes that can record your activity, location and other vital statistics. Millions of fitness-focused or diet-conscious people track their workouts or their desserts with apps and devices like Fitbit that track physical activity or calories burned. New technology also makes it easier to share results with others – who doesn’t want to brag the first time they run more than 5 miles (8km), or be praised when they’ve managed to lose 10 pounds (5kg)? A growing band of devotees centered in the United States, called the Quantified Self movement, has taken the effort to another level. Its members track a whole list of measures and push the technology available to keep tabs on their ideas, their mental health, even their microbiome – the colonies of bacteria that live on or inside their bodies. Some might scoff at their efforts to keep spreadsheets documenting their mood, diet or sleep patterns. “But the insights that we could learn from having all this quantified self data available are almost unfathomable,” says Amy Robinson, an organiser of Quantified Self Boston, a group that includes about 650 members and holds bimonthly meet-ups to share ideas and progress. “Quantified self helps you keep a reference to how you lived not only the day before but two weeks before or a year before,” Robinson says. “You know when you achieve your best, you know when you exceed your best and it makes that possible by simply having the numbers there.” Yet such lofty personal goals come down to something that couldn’t be more mundane: manually recording the number of daily bowel movements or every bite of food consumed. Lawrence David spent a year tracking 300 measures about his health and behaviour – including the microbes in his digestive system – while he was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David created a self-tracking system by tinkering with an iPhone app designed to record and manage business cards. Every meal became a new “card” entry, with hundreds he had to type in by hand over the year – one night’s entry could be cheeseburger and fries, the next pepperoni pizza. “One of the few datasets out there is going to be full of junk food,” he says, confessing to a personal weakness. He got to the point where he hated the process so much that he didn’t want to eat because then he’d have to record it. “It was terrible,” he admits. “Super tedious.” But when his boss, associate professor Eric Alm, got food poisoning while self-tracking, it was the first time the microbial pattern of human diarrhoea had been followed in real-time. Sounds gross, but understanding the progress of food poisoning in such a manner could be an important step toward developing treatments for it. And other than confirming his love of junk food, he did learn some useful things about himself. David discovered that he wasted a lot of time on e-mail during the day, and wasn’t as productive as he thought he was late at night. Now, he saves most of his e-mailing for the evenings – instead of disrupting his research to respond – and doesn’t feel guilty when he takes a night off. He’s stopped tracking most of the other measures, though. Number power Like David, others who use technology to self-track rely on a mix of mind-numbing and automated measures, and they talk about the greater good, as well as what they’ve learned about themselves. The Quantified Self movement originated in San Francisco, after it was first proposed by Wired editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007. As of October 2012, the Quantified Self movement counted more than 70 meet-up groups worldwide with over 5,000 members – of course, they keep track of that sort of thing. (There’s actually a greater number of self-tracking apps on mobile phones than members – around 7,500 at the moment.) Many of these self-trackers are researchers, computer scientists, or simply tech-savvy, 21st-century Benjamin Franklins who think the act of collecting so much data has the power to transform themselves and the rest of society. Meet-ups are part 7-minute show-and-tells, part social hour. At her first meet-up, in Alabama, Amy Robinson was the only one who had tried quantifying anything, while other attendees were just curious about the idea. In Boston, as you might expect from being an academic and tech hub, many of the participants have developed their own hacks and want to trade tips on how to maximise their record-keeping. Robinson says she has long been fascinated with where ideas come from, so she started sending herself an e-mail whenever a good one popped into her head. Recently, she collected six months of these e-mails – 770 in all – analysed them, and presented the results at a Quantified Self meetup in Boston in October. Among the themes that came up most often were “science”, “beautiful” and “health.” She found that she had the most new ideas immediately after attending an inspiring conference, travelling or experiencing something new. Doing this exercise helped feed her fascination with the human mind, she told the group, as well as “discover more ways to think about myself and discover how my mind works relative to other people’s.” Melanie Swan, founder of DIYgenomics, a California-based non-profit that promotes personalised medicine, has presented her findings at several Bay Area meet-ups, and she says meet-up attendees have changed as the movement has evolved. At first, the typical person was obsessive, “someone who is really rigorous about self-tracking either because of a health reason or they’re compelled to improve their mental performance or whatever,” she says. “But who’s now at the meet-ups is a much broader slice, though I would say it’s still a pretty tech-forward thinking kind of audience – anybody interested in improving an aspect of their health.” Power of the nudge While their interest in self-quantification is technological, another factor is a more general one: the growing obsession with self-improvement over the past few decades, says Natasha Schull, a cultural anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Weight Watchers has been telling people since the 1970s that if they want to lose weight, they need to track what they eat. The field of behavioural economics, which studies the connection between thoughts and financial decisions, has found that if you alter peoples’ social environment, they might be nudged into conducting more rational behaviour. For instance, if school cafeterias display fruit before fried chicken, students are more likely to eat fruit because they grab the first food they see. And having people track their actions makes a difference, says Schull, encouraging more people to make the effort to track. Self-tracking might not have been such a fringe activity in the past, either. There were plenty of people keeping diaries and self-accounts in the 1800s and 1900s, says Schull. “Even having a watch and being mindful of time is a form of self-regulation that went along with industrialisation,” she says. As long as there have been people tracking themselves, there have been people mocking those trackers, Schull adds. D.H. Lawrence wrote a piece making fun of Franklin’s self-obsession and the cockiness embedded in his 13 virtues, including this description: “He was a little model, was Benjamin. Doctor Franklin. Snuff-coloured little man! Immortal soul and all!” Behind such insults lies the idea that tracking the minutiae of one’s life can be pointless, an end in itself. Others worry that it could be used for self-destructive purposes, like an anorexic tracking how little she eats. “It seems to me in the contemporary US example, the means and the end are blurring,” says Schull, who co-taught a class at Harvard University in the autumn called “Self as Data”. “I think people are still motivated – at least they say they are – by some kind of transformation, but it’s seen as something that doesn’t really end.” Like the Alcoholics Anonymous model, where people who were once alcoholics are always recovering, Schull says. “It’s a different model of what health is.” Weight and see For Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University, tracking his weight helped him keep it under control. “If you watch things, you tend to do better, by virtue of being aware of them,” says Gerstein, who has a wifi-enabled bathroom scale that automatically records his weight and feeds it into a database. Gerstein has also been tracking his asthma symptoms in hope of being able to reduce his medication. He says he sees a little correlation between his exercise and his peak air flow, and thinks the more he can measure about himself, the more he’ll know about what triggers his wheezing and the better he’ll be at controlling it. It’s not just Gerstein’s data that’s important, this kind of information from thousands of people who have asthma could become much more powerful when it’s aggregated. “There’s a whole other level of what happens when all this information flows together and you can look for patterns and trends,” he says. But not all self-quantification efforts are successful. Schull’s student, Sneha Khullar, began – reluctantly – tracking several measures as a class assignment. In her final presentation to the class in December, she explained that she enjoyed using a pedometer to track her footsteps and an app called RescueTime, which showed she is most productive on Fridays – now that she’s given up partying. But writing down everything she ate was too much of a drag, and piling up chocolate wrappers didn’t help her moderate her sweet tooth. According to Khullar, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, self-tracking needs to be easy enough to carry out routinely, but not so easy that it can be ignored. Having to convert miles into kilometres so she could figure out how much she had run required just enough effort to get her invested in the process, with an incentive to keep running more. “I could not have imagined I could run more than 5 miles,” she proudly told her classmates. But, these tools were way more successful in behaviour-enhancing than in controlling bad habits, she admitted. And perhaps this barrier to participation is key to whether self-tracking will fully make the leap from tech obsessives to the mainstream public. “It’s a question of when does it become easy and when does it become useful,” says Stephen Wolfram, creator of the technical computing software Mathematica. He says he’s been self-tracking for a quarter of a century – everything from his personal health to his e-mail to the use patterns of every room in his house. But there are some things even he declines to measure. He doesn’t bother with skin conductivity measures, for instance, because he doesn’t like wearing the devices. He doesn’t wear a camera around his neck, “because it’s not socially realistic for the life I lead – maybe if I were much younger.” And he doesn’t record his side of phone conversations because speech recognition software still isn’t good enough to provide an accurate transcript. Why would he want a transcript of every conversation? “Am I repeating myself? You can immediately check,” he says. Privacy matters The next crucial step for self-tracking, several people said, will be the ability to integrate different data streams. Right now, the wifi-enabled scale doesn’t talk to the program that monitors blood pressure, diet or sleep – but such integration will come eventually. Maybe someday it will even link up with “smart” toilets that can read shifting microbial populations and warn of impending illness. The key will be finding ways to make the data meaningful, rather than just overwhelming. And to keep it private. Yale’s Gerstein says he worries a lot about the privacy aspects of all thins data. Right now, it seems harmless to share information about our sleep patterns, genes and microbial populations. But one day, that information could be more meaningful – and could be used against us. Sleep patterns could be relevant, say, in a court case about a traffic accident. People who post genetic information now are revealing things about their future children and grandchildren. “I think the fear is people will pile up a lot of information about themselves and share it without fully seeing the implications,” Gerstein says. Robinson says there’s no question the Quantified Self movement she is part of will have to address privacy issues. “Let the people who want to share their data in a way that maintains their privacy, but also helps other people,” she says. And doctors are going to need to learn how to deal with all the data their patients are beginning to bring them. Right now, Robinson says, people in the Quantified Self movement “want to share their information with their doctor, but their doctor doesn’t really know what to do with it.” Wolfram, the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research and founder of the technology company Wolfram|Alpha, thinks the data will eventually redefine what doctors do. A doctor would be hard-pressed to make sense of the data once people are wired to track their heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood pressure and dozens of other measures. But computers will be able to easily spot patterns and trends, diagnosing far more accurately than doctors can today, and far earlier in the disease process, says Wolfram, who is developing analytics to meet this need. He thinks that eventually we’ll go from sensor-based data to being able to treat whatever concern the technology diagnoses. If so, perhaps a Quantified Selfer will figure out a way to measure whether this actually improves our health.

Hundreds of people demonstrated outside the Ignacio Allende prison in the Gulf coast city of Veracruz after learning their relatives would be transferred, making visits more difficult. Gibson told the Mirror he had not requested the prison to be emptied. ""No-one asked for them to be transferred,"" he said. ""It was a decision by the Mexican authorities.""

Everton have agreed a £2m deal with Bradford City for the schoolboy midfielder. Green signs a two-and-a-half-year contract, receives a £45,000 signing-on fee in three instalments of £15,000, and a promising future with the Toffees beckons for the Dewsbury teenager. Four years later he is standing on railway tracks near his hometown waiting for the next train so that he can end his life, Greens hopes of making it as a Premier League player ruined by cocaine and alcohol. ""I was in that much debt, I thought Id lost my partner because of my drug use, and I didnt see a way back for me with football,"" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport. Now at sixth-tier Chester, who beat City of Liverpool 4-0 in the FA Cup second qualifying round on Saturday, Green opens up about having too much too soon, self-destruction, depression and how he is attempting to rebuild his life. ""Mental health and addiction is an everyday battle. Im giving it my best shot,"" he says. ""If others can learn from it, Id rather help."" A £2,000-a-month cocaine addiction It was Everton Under-21s boss David Unsworth who broke the news to a tearful Green, then aged 19, he was no longer required after a loan at League Two Tranmere Rovers in 2015. He had arrived at Goodison Park a fresh-faced schoolboy and was quickly compared to Wayne Rooney, who made his senior debut for the club aged 16. Green left without playing a first-team game having spent five weeks of his four years at Goodison Park in Londons Priory hospital, which provides a range of mental health and addictions treatments. ""Everton paid for it all, I think it was about £5,000-a-week,"" said Green, who was playing in the Toffees U21 side by the age of 16 alongside future England internationals John Stones and Ross Barkley. ""Before I turned 18 you wouldnt catch me out at night. As soon as I was 18 it was like a new world opened up. I was drinking, doing drugs and playing football. ""The first time I took drugs Id gone to watch football in a pub with mates. I was offered cocaine and it changed my life."" At first Green was able to hide his habit from the likes of Kevin Sheedy, his youth-team coach, but before long he was taking 30 grams a month and life was spiralling out of control. ""I was spending way over £2,000 a month. I remember one particular Monday morning I was supposed to be training. I didnt wake up until the afternoon. ""The night before Id gone to a friends house for drink and drugs. I think thats when alarm bells started ringing at Everton. ""I remember phoning a welfare officer at Everton one night. I was crying and said I need help. Soon after I was admitted to the Priory."" Drugs and alcohol took a toll on Green. Here he is aged 19 signing for non-league Ossett Albion five months after being released by Everton Ive earned £500,000 - Ive got an iPad to show for it Having joined Everton as a £150-a-week schoolboy, Greens earnings reached £110,000-a-year at the Premier League club. Since leaving three years ago, he has also had spells with Burnley and Oldham Athletic - as well as Viking in Norways top flight under Englishman Ian Burchnall, now boss at Swedish side Ostersunds. Green, who has also featured in the Scottish Premiership for Kilmarnock, believes he has earned at least £500,000 playing football. ""I have an iPad to show for it. Thats how much of a downfall my life has become because of drugs,"" he added. ""I squandered it all. Im embarrassed."" At Everton, the former England youth international did most of his socialising back home in Yorkshire. ""A good night out? Id easily spend about £1,500. A meal would cost between £200 and £300,"" he said. ""Id be like lets get a bottle of champagne and then a girl would come and sit next to me and Id be like would you like a bottle of champagne? ""Earning the money I was, I thought it was never going to end. ""Everybody wanted to know who I was and I was enjoying life. But I never got introduced to people who would keep me on the straight and narrow. They drank or did drugs and I fell into that circle. ""I got a brand new Mercedes-Benz A-Class and did about £4,000 damage to it. That stemmed from drink-driving. I was ridiculous, I used to drink-drive everywhere."" Before he turned 18 and problems with drink and drugs, Green (centre) was compared to Wayne Rooney It wasnt my time to go Green had four clubs within 14 months of leaving Everton. Soon after his release from the Toffees, he joined League One Oldham on a two-year deal. He lasted five months before his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in November 2015. ""It was due to drink and drugs, Id fallen out of love with the game and decided I didnt want to play any more."" By now, Green was on a downward spiral. He had a drink-driving conviction and, after blowing much of his earnings on alcohol and cocaine, he was struggling financially. In addition, he was suffering from depression. He did not stay away from football for long. A week after leaving Oldham, Green had signed for non-league Yorkshire side Ossett Albion for £80-a-game. He had gone from Everton to the eighth tier of English football in less than six months. It was around this time he first contemplated suicide. Green (second left) celebrates scoring for Tranmere Rovers in a League Two game against AFC Wimbledon in March 2015 ""Leaving Everton hit me hard,"" he said. ""I was stood on a railway track close to Mirfield station near Dewsbury ready for a train to come. I remember it being around eight or nine oclock at night. ""I hadnt written a note. It was all the pressures of everything in my life. The drugs, the alcohol, my mental health, football wasnt going well, lack of money. ""Then there was an announcement over the speakers that the next train was delayed. ""I thought it must be a sign that it cant be my time to go. I broke down in tears and walked away."" Greens mental health problems continued. He took an overdose after joining Salford City on loan from Burnley in early 2017. ""I went in the pill cupboard at home and took everything there was. I wanted to die at that time,"" he added. Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville, Salfords co-owner, offered his support. Green said: ""I was invited round to his house. I had been in hospital for taking too many tablets. We spoke for an hour about football and things Salford could do to help me."" Five months clean and a baby on the way He lives near Dewsbury with his two-year-old daughter Daisy and fiancee, Charli, while the couple are due to welcome a baby boy to the family in October. Gone are the flash cars and the hangers-on who formed part of his life when he was at Everton. Instead of a Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Green now drives a Kia Rio to and from Chester, the club he joined in July from National League North rivals Nuneaton. Money is tight but the player blames no-one but himself. Green is rebuilding his life with fiancee Charli and two-year-old daughter Daisy He relapsed in April but says he has not touched drink or drugs since, and attends weekly Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous meetings. Greens support network includes former Aston Villa and England defender Gary Charles, a recovering alcoholic who now has a business which provides care to people who are experiencing a wide range of problems, including depression and alcohol/drug dependency. ""Theres not a day I dont speak to him. Hes a lifesaver,"" adds Green. Without football, Id be dead At the time of this interview, Green has an additional battle in his life. Two months after signing, he has yet to make his Chester debut because of a back injury which is likely to require surgery. Hes frustrated and impatient. He has kept himself busy by getting to know Chester fans at home games, signing autographs and posing for pictures. Chester, a fan-owned club with a community trust, run a weekly mental health and wellbeing session which offers vulnerable members of society a chance to get out and play football. Green hopes opening up about his problems will raise awareness of mental health and addiction issues. Green has yet to play for his new club Chester because of a back problem ""Football is the only thing I am good at. Without it Id be dead,"" he added. ""I thought my career would be over if I came out and started talking about my issues with drugs. ""Then I said to myself how about being honest for once in your life and admit your problems.

Alcohol-related deaths 'rising',,,2008-01-25 10:37:55,,"Men still drink more than women Units explained Office for National Statistics figures show there were 13.4 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2006 - up from 12.9 in 2005. The mortality rate in men (18.3/100,000) was more than twice the rate for females (8.8/100,000). The overall death rate has almost doubled from 6.9 deaths per 100,000 people in 1991. It appears that for certain younger people whove been drinking heavily for most of their lives, the consequences are beginning to show themselves at ever earlier stages Frank Soodeen Alcohol Concern In total 8,758 deaths were linked to alcohol in 2006, compared to 4,144 deaths in 1991. For men, the death rates in all age groups increased between 1991 and 2006. The biggest increase was for men aged 35-54. Rates in this age group more than doubled over the period, from 13.4 to 31.1 deaths per 100,000. However, the highest rates in each year were for men aged 55-74. Similar pattern in women Death rates by age group for females were consistently lower than rates for males. However, the death rate for women aged 35­54 doubled between 1991 and 2006, from 7.2 to 14.8 per 100,000 population.

Frank Soodeen, of the charity Alcohol Concern, said: ""The link between alcohol misuse and ill health is well established. ""However these figures reveal some disturbing trends. For the second year in a row, the biggest rise in deaths has been among men aged 35-54. ""It appears that for certain younger people whove been drinking heavily for most of their lives, the consequences are beginning to show themselves at ever earlier stages. ""It is vital that the government finally starts investing more in alcohol treatment to help problem drinkers address these issues before the situation becomes irretrievable."" Dr Christopher Record, a liver disease consultant based in Newcastle, said: ""There is terrific pressure in society for people to drink. Those that dont drink are considered to be freaks and abnormal. ""But the main reason why, we are drinking more is alcohol is too cheap. Alcohol now is 50% less expensive that it was 25 years ago and, needless to say, consumption has gone up by 50% pro rata."" Professor Ian Gilmore, President of the Royal College of Physicians, was particularly concerned by the rise in deaths among women. ""My colleagues and I are certainly seeing more women with serious liver damage than ever before in our clinics,"" he said. Tougher line call Sarah Matthews, of the British Liver Trust, said that a major part of the problem was that alcohol was cheap, readily available and glamorised by celebrities. ""The government desperately needs to take a tougher approach with the alcohol and retail industry, clamping down on cheap promotions and irresponsible advertising - particularly before the 9pm watershed. ""Clear and effective health warnings on alcohol like alcohol kills would also help in raising awareness of the damage that alcohol can have."" Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said the government was launching a £10m education campaign to raise awareness of alcohol, and reviewing alcohol pricing and promotion. It had also toughened enforcement of underage sales by retailers, and planned more help for people who wanted to drink less.

Life inside a sex addiction clinic in the UK,,,2010-04-05 03:05:32,,"Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. UK sex addiction clinics are reporting a rise in the number of people seeking help, a fact being linked to golfer Tiger Woods admitting his affairs. BBC Reporter Gavin Lee was given access to one of the few sex addiction clinics in the UK. The group begins in a similar way to how Id expect an alcoholics anonymous meeting to start. The clients sit together in a circle, and the first to speak is 27-year-old Danny James from Liverpool. ""Hi, Im Danny. Im a sex addict."" Danny used to live in Blackpool and speaks openly about how he destroyed his relationship with his girlfriend and daughter because of his addiction. ""You could liken it to a drug. The hit after sex, Id start to need that feeling more and more. After a while that feeling wouldnt last as long so youd do it again and again. ""I started losing work, because I was concentrating on going out finding people to sleep with. Every day, Id be straight into a pub, on the job and it wasnt that hard to find in Blackpool cause its what most people come here looking for anyway, with hen nights and so on. It was kind of put on a plate."" Childhood issues That cycle led to Danny breaking up from his partner and losing contact with his daughter. He lost his business and says he was depressed and disgusted with himself. ""It was only from going to therapy I realised there was something wrong. With me, there was a lot of back issues from my childhood. We went into those issues and rebuilt my life. ""I know it sounds daft but I did things like going to the zoo with somebody and just learn how to be normal again."" It got to the point where one of my parents would stay at home to keep an eye on me because they knew about the suicide attempts Danny, sex addict Danny attends the Steven Pope Therapy Clinic in Blackpool every week, which costs him £40 an hour. Paul is another self-confessed sex addict. He is a quiet member of the group and is reluctant to take part in discussions. He said it started through boredom when he started to search for explicit content on his computer, which led to buying hundreds of DVDs and magazines. He described his condition as obsessive, which also led him to become deeply depressed. Woods effect The centre has taken on 52 new clients in the past two months, compared with only a handful each month last year. This rise appears to be reflected across the small number of sex addiction clinics in the UK. Therapists say the many new clients have cited celebrities such as Tiger Woods as the inspiration for them to seek help. Golfer Tiger Woods many affairs have been highly publicised Steve Pope, who owns the therapy clinic in Blackpool, says the interest from people wanting help has been unprecedented. ""People are now coming forward to talk their issues through. Woods on one side has been to hell and back, as his family has, but hes saved lives and thats the Tiger Woods effect."" The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity, a professional body set up to support research into sex addiction, has also recorded a rise in the number British clients seeking help. Paula Hall, who is in charge of the service said many professionals were now looking for further training in this field. ""Theyre having more and more clients coming to them looking for services and up until now theres been little or no training for this in the UK."" Troublesome behaviour The treatment in the UK is based on methods used in the US where sexual behaviour therapy is big business. However, the term is not technically recognised as a medical illness. Professor Glen Wilson, a specialist in sexual behaviour at Gresham College, dismisses the idea that it could be an addiction. ""Whatever the celebs have we all think we ought to have as well, and of course the drug companies will want to get in on the act too. Once a behaviour has been medicalised they will come up with pills for it,"" he says. I think to say that sex addiction doesnt exist is a real insult to the many intelligent men and women who suffer from the condition every day Paula Hall, psychotherapist ""There are tremendous pressures on medicalising behaviour which is no more than troublesome. Its not the same as drug addiction because its not a hijacking of the circuits by a chemical, it is what the circuits were set up for. ""That is rewarding you for sexual behaviour which has reproductive and survival significance."" Many medical experts hold a similar opinion towards the term sex addiction. But Paula Hall, whos a trained psychotherapist, says she vehemently disagrees with their analysis and believes the problem has not been researched properly. ""The people out there still saying this does not exist do not understand the condition. ""It is not about sex, its about that dependency and that compulsion, and I think to say that sex addiction doesnt exist is a real insult to the many intelligent men and women who suffer from the condition every day."" Despite the lack of recognition for the term sex addict, the clients in Blackpool say for them the addiction is all too real. The feelings are put into some perspective when I ask Danny what he thinks his life would be life without therapy. ""Id be dead,"" he says. ""Theres no two ways about it. ""It got to the point where one of my parents would stay at home to keep an eye on me because they knew about the suicide attempts. I would have gone through with it. Id be dead.""

Weekend edition: The best of the week's reads,A collection of some of the best reads from the BBC News website this week.,,20 March 2015,BBC News,"A collection of some of the best reads from the BBC News website this week, with an injection of your comments. Lots of readers have been commenting on the short clip of Sirga the lioness rushing to hug the man who rescued her when she was a cub. When Valentin Gruener opens her cage, Sirga ecstatically throws her paws around his neck. Allan Ainsworth says on Facebook that it shows ""animals know - and recognise - kindness"". It reminds him of a story ""where two fellas had a lion cub from Harrods"". Allan recalls that the lion was rehoused in Africa. ""The two guys went out some time later… It threw itself at them both in an embrace of love and fondness."" Allan has remembered correctly, and in that reunion in 1972, Christian the lion reacts in a very similar way to Sirga. The lion hugger Scoop of the 60s Image copyright Getty Images Heres an unusual way to get a scoop: hide your camera in a bouzouki guitar. One tip though, this may only work if youre trying to get a story in the kind of place where there are actually bouzouki players. Stumped for the kind of place where there are bouzouki guitars? Try a Greek shipping magnates yacht. Thats where young Greek journalist Nico Mastorakis sneaked on to get the scoop that Jackie Kennedy was going to marry Aristotle Onassis. For Christiane Vejlo this was an insight into the early days of paparazzi work, while Joanna Williams thinks it tells us something about press freedom 40 years ago.

Alex Duval Smith walked into the tax office and was told,  You have the choice between two income tax regimens, 30% or 3%, which shall it be?  She went for 3%. And thats how they do tax in Mali. Theres a logic to this. The government believes the 3% rate will attract more tax payers. At the moment they struggle to raise 1% or 2%.

There had been a 20mph speed limit set in 1903 but it was repealed in 1930. The spate of deaths caused a change of heart in government in 1934 and the 30mph limit was brought in. But it still has its opponents. They argue speed limits dont improve safety because drivers just focus on speedometers. Transport researcher Anna Plyushteva responds to that argument on Twitter with one word: hilarity. How did the UK get the 30mph limit?

'What I learned from confronting my alcoholic mum',Caitlin Croft was 12 when she first tried to talk to her mum Tracey about her alcohol problem.,,None,,"Caitlin Croft was 12 when she first tried to talk to her mum Tracey about her alcohol problem. Every afternoon after work, Tracey would lock herself in her room and drink until she fell asleep, normally having a bottle of vodka a night. Caitlin, now 17, found it hard to confront her mum. But it was worthwhile because, after more than a decade of addiction, Traceys now in recovery and hasnt had a drink for eight months. Heres what Caitlin has learned. Anyone can have alcohol problems Seeing her mums struggle with alcohol made Caitlin realise that anyone can get addicted. ""When you picture an alcoholic you dont think of an ordinary person,"" says Caitlin. ""Youd think of a homeless person having those problems, not a normal average person with a family and home."" But its not uncommon. The government says around 1.6 million adults in England have some level of alcohol dependence. And almost 11 million are drinking enough to harm their health. Despite drinking heavily every night, Tracey managed to keep her job. So from the outside it may not have been obvious she had a problem. Ignoring the addiction wont make it go away For several months Caitlin avoided talking to her mum about her addiction. ""Every night Id be in my room on my own, and I knew my mum would be next door drunk,"" she explains. ""I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it shell get better. But I just saw it getting worse."" I told myself so many times that if I just ignore it shell get better So Caitlin says she learned to confront Tracey in the mornings when she was sober, instead of talking to her while she was drunk. ""Then she could understand me a bit more,"" she says. ""I learned that its easier to get everything out in the open, rather than hiding it and pretending it will just go away."" Make sure youve got evidence Telling someone theyve got an alcohol problem is a serious thing to do. You need to think carefully about what you will say to them, Caitlin explains. ""I couldnt just accuse mum of being drunk. She thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk ""I didnt know what type of mood she would be in, so I always used to plan in my head how I was going to [approach her]."" She says she realised that her mum may not have known how much she was drinking. ""She was in denial and she thought she was hiding it, but I knew when she was drunk. ""So I used to tear her room apart looking for bottles. ""I found 10, 20 bottles hidden under her bed, under her pillow, in her drawers. ""Then I had evidence. It was clear she had been drinking, and then it was harder for her to deny it."" Tracey tells Newsbeat this approach helped her confront her problem. But it wouldnt work for everyone with alcohol dependency. Encourage them to get help Tracey started to drink heavily after her husband left the family. ""Over time I started to understand why she had a drink problem,"" explains Caitlin. A lot of people dont understand that its an illness ""It affected my mums health - mentally, physically and emotionally."" Caitlin and her older brothers encouraged their mum to seek medical help. Traceys drinking had left her with an inflamed liver, a condition which can be life threatening. She was also suffering mental problems, and ended up spending a lot of time in hospital. ""A lot of people dont understand that its an illness, just like anything else you get diagnosed with. ""So even though its hard you have to see it from their point of view."" Get support for yourself, too Alcohol dependency doesnt just damage the person who is drinking. It affects everyone around them. ""Its not nice to see your mum in that position and theres not really a lot you can do to help,"" says Caitlin. ""It was tiring to see her not making any improvements."" Caitlin says she found it helpful to talk to her friends and to her older brothers. And she moved in with one of them when Traceys illness was at its worst, which helped her concentrate on the other parts of her life like revising for her GCSEs. Together, the family helped Tracey to get better. Links to help and advice You can get advice about alcohol on the BBC Advice pages. Support groups and helplines are offered by a number of organisations in the UK including Al-Anon (linked to the Alcoholics Anonymous organisation) and DrugFam.

LA opens new criminal court for troubled veterans,"Los Angeles has convened a new court to handle the growing number of military veterans who fall into trouble with the law, the BBC's David Willis reports.",,19 September 2010,BBC News,"Image caption The programme is limited to veterans charged with non-violent crimes Los Angeles has convened a new court to handle the growing number of veterans suffering from stress and substance abuse who fall into trouble with the law. The BBCs David Willis meets some of the first to face the judge. Delton Baker Jr still has the air of a military man. He stands tall and erect and dresses in a black suit and tie. For eight years his home was the sprawling Camp Pendleton Marine Base near San Diego, California. From there, his regiment saw tours of duty in Grenada, Lebanon and Okinawa. Then he fell sick, and that was when his problems began. ""I started to find that I had difficulties with my knees,"" Baker, 50, told the BBC. ""They were weak, and it was becoming more and more of a challenge to keep up with the training."" After his discharge from the military Baker was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Unable to find work, he turned to drink and drugs, and soon fell into trouble with the law. ""I got out of the service and it just seemed as though there wasnt anything for me to do,"" he said. ""So I fell by the wayside."" Non-violent offences Baker was the first person to face a judge at the newly launched court for veterans in downtown Los Angeles. As a condition for participation in the programme, he had pleaded guilty to a drug possession charge. The court, which will convene weekly, caters to former servicemen and women who are suffering from PTSD and other forms of mental illness, such as traumatic brain injury. The voluntary programme will enable them to receive treatment instead of a jail term. The scheme, which is only open to veterans charged with non-violent crimes, has been tried in other parts of the US and deemed a success. ""This is long overdue,"" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan, who will preside over the veterans cases, told the BBC. Image caption An estimated 30% of US troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from some stress disorder ""These people served their country, they stuck their necks out for the rest of us, and some - because of their experiences - are more susceptible to drugs and alcohol and also to mental illness."" Depending on the nature of their crimes, veterans could be referred to treatment within the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) network of outpatient and clinical care facilities. The veterans will be supervised for a set period of time; if they violate the courts conditions their penalties could be increased. Former tank commander Alex Barlow, 48, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after his discharge from the US Marines Corps. He spent several years in Los Angeless notorious Skid Row district, which has a large homeless population, and also turned to drink and drugs. The second defendant to be brought before the veterans court, he too agreed to enrol in a VA programme after pleading guilty to petty theft. Afterwards, he said he looked forward finally to having a roof over his head. Homeless veterans ""Its just good to feel that someone recognises I have a problem, rather than that I am a problem,"" he told the BBC. The VA estimates that 131,000 former servicemen and women are homeless on any given night. In Los Angeles - the city thought to have the largest homeless population in the US - an estimated 8,000 veterans sleep on the streets. VA social worker Sergio Antoniuk sees a clear link between the large number of veterans sleeping rough and figures suggesting that as many as 30% of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan could be suffering from some sort of stress disorder. ""Its vitally important that these people have their needs assessed, and we draw up treatment programmes so these people can be rehabilitated,"" he told the BBC. Delton Baker Jr, meanwhile, had already enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous before he came to the veterans court. The judge referred him to the VA for counselling and additional support. He left the court beaming. ""Its good to know that somebody cares for us,"" he said. ""Some of us here have been through a lot, and if you dont have someone to talk to, you bottle up your experiences and thats when the problems arise. I think a lot of us just need someone who will sit down and listen.""",{},"['va', 'los', 'angeles', 'opens', 'baker', 'told', 'veterans', 'la', 'court', 'stress', 'treatment', 'troubled', 'programme', 'criminal']","Non-violent offencesBaker was the first person to face a judge at the newly launched court for veterans in downtown Los Angeles.

Ive seen patients whove been admitted with pretty catastrophic bleeding from stomach and oesophagus with no prior warning of a problem of their liver. Dr Jonathan Mitchell Consultant hepatologist Alcohol killed my son Send us your comments Europes attitudes to alcohol Twenty-four organisations, representing doctors and charities, have joined together to form the Alcohol Health Alliance. It wants the government to make alcohol misuse a higher priority. Public health minister Dawn Primarolo said the government had already drawn up a plan for concerted action. The drink industry says alcohol consumption is falling, and that increasing the cost would hit the majority of people who enjoy a drink in moderation. Generational shift The comments of the specialists who responded to the BBC reveal a generational shift on hospital wards around the UK. Whereas before most hospital consultants would have seen patients in their fifties or sixties in the past, they now describe seeing patients in their early twenties with alcohol-related hepatitis, and women whose livers are permanently damaged with the scarring known as cirrhosis by the time they are 30. Dr Jonathan Mitchell, a consultant hepatologist in Plymouth, is one of the specialists who contacted the BBC. He said many of his patients did not realise the permanent damage to their health caused by regular heavy drinking. Until it reaches a critical stage most liver disease is virtually without symptoms. Dr Mitchell said: ""Ive seen patients whove been admitted with pretty catastrophic bleeding from stomach and oesophagus with no prior warning of a problem of their liver. ""Others may present with jaundice or swelling of the abdomen because theres a lot of fluid in the abdomen. ""All these three things are signs of quite advanced liver disease and can come out of the blue."" Heavy drinking normal Fatty deposits gradually build up on the liver as alcohol interferes with the way it would normally be processed. What follows is an inflammation within the liver which often leads to low grade hepatitis. Although the liver has a remarkable capacity to regenerate the damage eventually reaches the stage where the scarring permanently alters the structure of the liver. For some patients this will lead to an agonising wait on the liver transplant waiting list before they are forty. He is not alone in his concerns that the normalisation of heavy drinking is putting a generation at risk from a silent killer. Of the 115 consultants who contacted the BBC 101 said there had been an increase in the number of patients they were seeing for alcohol-related disease. The shift in the age profile of their patients is also very marked, with 77 saying they had treated a patient under the age of 25. If you look at the burden of damage to society, its hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs. Professor Ian Gilmore Royal College of Physicians Young addicts beat the bottle Expert tips on drinking safely The doctors responses are a depressing snapshot of the ages and condition of the patients they see: 24-year-old woman with advanced cirrhosis who died 25-year-old with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis 19-year-old female with end stage liver disease 21-year-old who died from acute alcohol poisoning. While attention is often focused on the social disorder caused by binge drinking, many doctors say the serious health effects are not given enough attention. Professor Ian Gilmore, president of the Royal College of Physicians, is one of the leading figures in the new campaign. He said: ""If you look at the burden of damage to society, its hugely greater for alcohol than for drugs, but the majority of money has always gone on drugs, partly because of the strong link to crime."" Government view The government has recently beefed up its Home Office target for reducing harm from alcohol. It has also introduced a cross-departmental Alcohol Strategy. This includes a public information campaign to promote sensible drinking, an independent review of alcohol pricing and promotion, toughened enforcement of underage sales by retailers and plans to introduce more help for people who want to drink less. Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, said the government had introduced a comprehensive strategy to tackle problem drinking. She said tax on alcohol in the UK was already the second highest in Europe, and only about 1% of pubs had extended opening hours since extended licensing laws were introduced. A bigger problem was the discounting of prices by supermarkets and off licences. She said: ""Were looking at where its available, who its available to, how its being marketed, what the targeting is and what we can do to give clear messages and to make those who are selling it responsible.""",{},"['hard', 'young', 'problem', 'disease', 'damage', 'liver', 'alcohol', 'warning', 'bbc', 'drinking', 'patients', 'hits', 'health', 'stage']","The warning comes as a new alliance calls for a rise in alcohol taxes, and a bar on TV advertising before 9pm.

'I survived abuse - now I'm starting to date at 47',"Matt is a virgin, but wants to start a family. So, for the first time, he's immersing himself in the world of online dating.",,13 May 2019,BBC News,"At 47, Matt is a virgin, but wants to settle down and start a family. So, for the first time, he is immersing himself in the world of online dating. Matt Carey is struggling to find the right words to describe himself on his online dating profile. ""Youre an attractive man. Youre lovely, intelligent and funny,"" suggests his friend Maddy, who is helping him. Matt responds with a self-deprecating laugh. ""You dont have to reveal too much when you first meet someone,"" Maddy advises. Matt is wary. ""This is all new,"" he says, betraying the nervousness he feels at putting himself out on the dating scene. According to his friends, Matt is a catch - a kind, attractive man who has had a successful career in theatre management since moving to London from his childhood home in the West Country. But, despite his confident appearance, Matt has struggled with intimacy his entire adult life. At 47, he is a still a virgin, though he is desperate to find a partner, settle down and start a family. Find out more Matt tells his story to Sarah Bowen on BBC Radio 4s The Untold on Monday 13 May at 11:00 Listen again on iPlayer or download The Untold podcast ""For so long in my life I shut down the possibilities of it. I lived in a fantasy world or put women on a pedestal as a means to not do anything,"" he says. Matts fears around forming close relationships stem from his childhood in a south-west coastal town. He counts himself lucky to have grown up in an affluent area, with two older siblings and plenty of friends to play with in the parks and sand dunes at the local beach. Then one hot day when he was eight, after playing football, he walked into a public lavatory. Two men followed him into the small, confined space. Image caption Matt aged eight One of the men complimented him on his playing, saying he remembered Matt had once waved to them from the football pitch. Matt said he didnt recognise them. But the men persisted, calling Matt a liar and saying they would tell his headmaster about his rude behaviour. At this point, one of men feigned a pain in his groin area. The other told Matt that it was his fault as he had hurt the mans feelings. He said Matt needed to rub the mans groin to make him feel better. Matt says he knew this wasnt right and started to cry. The men kept insisting that Matt do what they wanted, putting more and more pressure on him. In the end, he relented. ""I remember going home and Mum saying to me: Whats wrong?,"" he says. Matt hardly ate that night. He says it is hard to overestimate the sense of confusion and guilt he experienced. He didnt think he could tell his parents because he felt in some way responsible for what had happened. ""It was like being in a car crash. You dont know what the hells going on. So you shut down and pretend nothing has happened,"" he says. Even though he had been deeply shaken by the experience, Matt saw his abusers again for the next 18 months. He was assaulted on more than 30 occasions in 12 different public toilets and, once, in a private flat. One time, other men and children joined in. ""They control you by threatening you that things will get worse,"" he says, explaining why he kept going back to the men. ""Theres a presence of evil. Youre scared they might kill you so you go along with it. ""The complicity control is a lot worse than the abuse - the threats, the evil atmosphere."" Image copyright BBCV School photographs from this time show the effect the abuse had on Matts childhood. A photo from before shows him happy and smiling with a messy mop of blonde hair. A photo from a year later shows that he had pulled out much of his hair. When the abuse eventually stopped, Matt made a promise to himself that no-one would ever hurt him again. He says it was like something inside him shut down. ""For a lot of my adult life Ive had real problems with sexual intimacy,"" he says, although he wanted a sexual relationship. ""For years I imagined sex to be something really deeply uncomfortable and horrific."" Becoming a teenager was difficult. Matt says he longed for a pill to stop his developing sexual feelings. He felt confused and ashamed - dirty on the inside, even though outwardly he was a bit of a lad. ""It was all a front,"" he says. Image caption Matt aged 12, after the abuse had stopped ""Any girl showing me interest, particularly any girl coming on to me, I just ran away from. My fear was ultimately at some point, they might want to have sex."" Playing rugby helped him express his feelings, especially the rage he felt inside. Aggressively tackling other players became a way of coping with the sense of intimidation he felt in the presence of other men. Another emotional crutch was alcohol. Matt began drinking at the age of 15. By 17 he was stealing to fund his habit and by his late teens, he was dependent on alcohol to get through the day. ""Initially I drank because of the buzz because I felt much better being drunk than being sober,"" he says. Matts drinking became so extreme that he started experiencing blackouts, tremors and palpitations. Once, after a big night out, he had a hallucination of Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini standing beside his bed. Instead of stopping, he decided to drink more. Eventually, at the age of 20, Matt had a breakdown and was kicked out of university. He returned to living with his parents, knowing he needed help. This led him to Alcoholics Anonymous where he found a sense of spirituality that became the basis for his healing. Where to go for help Information and support for anyone affected by sexual abuse, current or historic - including sources of support for children, young people and concerned parents Coming to terms with his alcohol abuse allowed Matt to begin opening up about his sexual abuse. For years he had told no-one about what he had been through. ""You feel so complicit and the manipulation forces your silence so you dont tell people - you go out of your way to hide it. Its a conscious denial to survive,"" he says. A psychologist encouraged Matt to open up to his parents. Initially, Matt was cautious, not wanting to hurt them. And, although he knew they were not responsible for the abuse, he felt angry that they hadnt been there to protect him. He says it was easier to speak to his sister, Caroline. ""It was feelings of guilt - why wasnt I there for him? I was the older bossy sister who thought I looked out for him, so it was quite upsetting to find out this had happened and I was completely oblivious of it,"" she says. Caroline considered advising Matt to go to the police, but she realised there would be no evidence for a prosecution. Instead, she offered to do whatever her brother needed to help him heal and live a full life. Over the years, Matt has been helped by various forms of therapy and by travelling to India and Brazil. He has learnt to manage his emotional triggers and get over his feelings of discomfort about being physically close to another person. Image caption Matt travelling in India in 2016 But the results have come slowly. Matt says it took him 20 years before he was able to fully remember the coercion and threats made by the paedophile ring. He says it was only then that he knew, on a deep emotional level, that the abuse had not been his fault. ""This has allowed me to move forward and let go of the shame,"" he says. As Matt has become more open about the abuse he suffered, his confidence has grown. He now helps others who have been through similar experiences, and is considering joining a NSPCC campaign which helps children know where to turn if they are abused. Hes also found the confidence to put his own story into words, in a self-published book. But in his personal life, Matts progress has been more hesitant. Although he finished writing his dating profile, for months, he held back making it live. In particular, he worried that dates would ask him to explain why he didnt drink and why he hadnt been in a relationship before. He worried that his only experience of sex was the abuse, and that he had never had a relationship based on equality, sharing, kindness and love. Image caption Matt at a charity ball in January 2019 ""If anyone on a date senses someone is holding something back, it can raise alarm bells. Maybe its best to be open,"" he says. Finally he summoned the courage to post his profile online. Almost immediately he received some promising responses. Now Matt is ready for his first date arranged through the website - a coffee with a woman with whom he feels he has a lot in common. He says he is trying hard not to over-think what he will say and what he will do. He feels has made a massive step forward. ""So much of the shame around the abuse has left me, so I dont feel I need to apologise for the after-effects,"" Matt says. ""Im more accepting that Im scared, but I also feel excited as well that there is an opportunity - that my life isnt about the abuse. ""It isnt everything."" Matt Carey is a pseudonym.

Dorset woman's bulimia made her suicidal,"With National Eating Disorders Awareness Week well under way, a Weymouth woman reveals how she freed herself from the vicious cycle of bulimia and overeating.",,24 February 2011,BBC News,"Image caption Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, research shows. Three years ago Anne-Marie wanted to die. For 11 years the Weymouth office worker, whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity, had been trapped in a vicious cycle of surreptitious binge-eating and vomiting. By 2008 her eating disorder had taken over her life to the extent that once her bills were paid any remaining money was spent on food. ""My life revolved around food,"" the 27-year-old told BBC News. ""On a typical morning I would go to the supermarket to fill two shopping bags with bread, chocolate, cakes and biscuits. ""Then Id go home, eat it and stick my two fingers down my throat to make myself sick."" Anne-Marie is among some 1.6 million people in the UK with an eating disorder, according to Beat, a charity which supports adults and young people affected by this form of mental illness. It has been running a host of events across the country to mark Eating Disorder Awareness Week. A spokeswoman for the charity said: ""We believe more people are becoming aware that it is a serious psychological condition. ""There are so many preconceptions but you can beat an eating disorder."" In my head, I was fat and ugly but in reality I was a normal-looking child Anne-Marie Sufferers exhibit an abnormal attitude towards food which causes them to drastically alter their eating habits and behaviour. Another type of eating disorder is anorexia nervosa, where a person starves themselves and exercises excessively to maintain a life-threateningly low weight. Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, with 90% of people with the condition female, according to the NHS Choices website. For Anne-Maries behaviour to go undetected at work, she had to employ cunning tactics - locking herself in her office at lunchtime to binge-eat and then vomiting in the nearby ladies toilet. She said she always feared a passing colleague would hear her. ""I was frightened people would see what I was eating and the amounts,"" Anne-Marie explained. ""I did all my eating in secret and then ate normally in front of people."" Anne-Marie blames an inability to express her emotions as a child and being unhappy with her appearance for her self-destructive behaviour. ""I did not like the way I looked,"" she added. ""In my head, I was fat and ugly but in reality I was a normal-looking child. ""I tried to control these feelings through food."" First bite She said she had fallen ""into the depths of despair"" when fate intervened in the form of her future husband Jonathan whom she met through mutual friends at a party. ""He had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous for seven years and suggested I attend an Overeaters Anonymous (OA) meeting. ""I was sceptical about it, at first, but then I found I liked the people there."" Anne-Marie credits the meetings - which she has been attending up to three times a week for the past three years - with bringing about an end to her binge-eating and purging cycle. ""I have learned to express myself and am now aware that if I am compelled to overeat there are unresolved emotions,"" she continued. ""We also encourage each other at the meetings to call someone before we take the first bite."" Other OA tools Anne-Marie now uses as a part of her coping mechanism include writing her thoughts down and offering support to fellow attendees. She added: ""My life is really good now, I am happily married, I changed my job and I express my feelings more. ""The fact that I have not binged or vomited to get through my day a miracle and a relief.""",{},"['bulimia', 'womans', 'annemarie', 'express', 'dorset', 'times', 'eating', 'life', 'reality', 'ugly', 'anorexia', 'disorder', 'nervosa', 'suicidal']","Image caption Bulimia is about five times more common than anorexia nervosa, research shows.

Stafford bishop accuses government over alcohol abuse,"The Bishop of Stafford hits out at the government for ""doing little"" to address the problem of alcohol abuse.",,1 June 2011,BBC News,"Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales. The Bishop of Stafford has criticised the government for ""doing little"" to prevent alcohol abuse. The Rt Rev Geoff Annas has described alcohol misuse as ""one of the major sins of our time"". Writing in a pastoral letter, published in parish magazines across the Diocese of Lichfield, he called for a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes towards drinking. The government has said it is tackling alcohol-related crime ""at its source"" through a variety of measures. He said charities were left to tackle the effects of ""this drug abuse"", with government action not going far enough. Major sin In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales. They said banning shops and bars from selling drinks for less than the tax paid on them would cut crime and set a ""base price"" for the first time. It works out at 38p for a can of weak lager and £10.71 for a litre of vodka. In the letter, Mr Annas said: ""One definition of sin is anything that comes between us and God and makes us less than the person God created us to be. ""Alcohol abuse is one of the major sins of our time - and it is one that governments do very little to prevent. ""Instead, it is left to amazing organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous or in the inspirational OConnor Gateway Charitable Trust, of which I am proud to be a trustee, to tackle the effects of this drug abuse."" Drink at home ""Binge-drinking"" was not the fault of pub and nightclub owners, he said, nor was it down to an extension in opening hours. ""The extension of the licensing laws means that they can stay open later but in reality many [people] now do not even arrive until 11 at night,"" said Mr Annas. ""Prior to this they drink in their own homes, consuming alcohol which they have purchased very cheaply in their local supermarket or corner shop. ""The government has introduced minimum pricing but the level it has been set is derisory."" A Home Office spokesman said the government was tackling alcohol related crime at its source by taking tough action against irresponsible premises, giving communities a chance to have a say over licensing and allowing councils to charge more for late licences. ""And we havent just stood by while suppliers let drink be sold so cheaply that it leads to drunken violence, weve taken steps to ensure that by the end of the year the sale of alcohol below cost is banned,"" the spokesman said.",{},"['crime', 'price', 'bishop', 'unveiled', 'tackle', 'set', 'spokesman', 'alcohol', 'stafford', 'minimum', 'source', 'abuse', 'tackling', 'accuses']","Image caption In January, ministers unveiled plans to set a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales.

I begged social services to take my children away,Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict before overcoming a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships.,,19 January 2018,BBC News,"Sam spent more than 20 years as an addict, battling to get clean and sober. But she didnt want the methadone she was repeatedly prescribed by her local drugs service - she wanted to be abstinent. She tells Milly Chowles how she overcame a cycle of trauma and abusive relationships to beat her addictions by herself. My husband didnt tell me it was heroin when he gave it to me to smoke. He told me it was cannabis resin. And then after about a week I really started to feel unwell. There was a programme on the telly about a boy who had a habit and was withdrawing and I linked it to what I was experiencing. I woke my husband up in the middle of the night and absolutely went ballistic. We had two children by then. I can remember saying: ""I dont want to do this no more, I dont want to go further,"" and begging him not to go and score. And he just didnt listen to me. I remember just sitting in that front room watching him smoking, and feeling defeated. The crack came in about a week later. I can remember watching him smoking it and he was going: ""Just try one, just try one,"" and I was like: ""No, no, I will never ever smoke that stuff,"" and Id believe it when I was saying that. But in the end I gave in, and I didnt stop for the best part of the next two decades. It is a phenomenal force. It just takes over you. Id started shoplifting and offending, minor offences. I got arrested quite quickly and I went to prison. My first sentence was only eight weeks, of which I served four. While I was there the children went into care for a little while. I managed to get them back when I came out, but two months later Id been sectioned. So I rang up social services from the psychiatric hospital and said: ""You need to go round to my house and take my children."" Theyd been left with my husband who was using drugs - I knew they werent safe. And they came, they took them, and they were adopted within a year. They never returned to my care again. The adoption papers were signed while I was in prison. Id gone from psychiatric hospital back on to the streets, back into prison. And thats how my life was for 15 years - in and out of psychiatric hospitals and in and out of prisons. Find out more Sam (not her real name) was speaking to The Fix, a series for Womans Hour on BBC Radio 4 about women and addiction You can listen again to Milly Chowles reports for The Fix here I can remember my last visit with my children and the obsession to use drugs was so strong that even as I took them down to the car, I was texting my dealer. People say: ""Oh youll find acceptance around it."" I accept that I was ill. And I can honestly say that would not have happened if I didnt have the substance in me. But its something that I still havent forgiven myself for. I dont know if I ever will. I take full responsibility for my using and I dont blame my husband. I have an illness. But addiction all comes down to relationships and being hurt again and again, and being left with no trust. I was always in a relationship and every relationship was dysfunctional. Every single one. The really sad part of it is that I really thought these men loved me. When I began doing sex work they would sit and wait for me to get home and then theyd go to score with the money Id just earned. Looking back now I really kick myself that I allowed that to happen - that Id go out and let that stuff happen to me, and then give over my money and share what Id just earned with somebody who didnt value me whatsoever. How could they watch me go out there night after night, somebody who theyre supposed to love and care about? I dont know how they could touch me after Id gone and done that stuff. One night I had a really bad experience. A punter raped me in his car. I just got out of that car. I didnt go home, I didnt tell my husband. I went back out and I found another punter. I dont remember much of the night but I remember those two punters. I went straight back out again because of the obsession to use more drugs. I needed the money. Its that powerful. Thats the control drugs had over me. In the end I met somebody else while my husband was in prison, serving a long sentence. I went from this co-dependent using relationship to a very violent abusive relationship. The progression with each relationship, it just got worse. And again I stayed. Once he headbutted me, to the point that I passed out. When I came round the first thing I said was, ""Oh, give me a cuddle please."" And Im the one saying sorry for something I havent done. Absolutely nuts. I stayed in that relationship for about eight years. It wasnt the heroin or crack that brought me to my knees in the end, it was the alcohol. The two children from my second relationship had gone off to live with family. I was isolated in a flat on my own and my life for 18 months was waking up, and getting as much Tennents Super in me as I could. Some days I was too frightened to go out the door and get my methadone script - I would rather sit there and withdraw as long as I had the Tennents. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How ""Sam"" was introduced to drugs by her husband. I couldnt even open the curtains in the end. Couldnt take sunlight on my face. I did not want to be in any type of reality at all. I despised myself, absolutely despised myself. My friend Pat died six days before I was due to go into rehab. I can remember just smashing my flat up. I must have been screaming so loudly that my neighbours rang the police and the police kicked my door in. I was on my front-room floor, screaming that I didnt want to die. Id never had a policeman hug me, but one of them hugged me. I must have looked such a mess. I think it was in that moment I knew Id had enough, Id really had enough of it. Id been fighting to get into recovery for a long time. There were three different treatment centres and numerous detoxes along the way. But in May 2014 I went off to a treatment centre in Weston-super-Mare. I was so angry when I got there that they put me on a behavioural contract almost immediately. They said if I didnt conform to it and stop arguing with everyone, that I would be discharged. I looked at this contract one night and thought: ""Im not going to be able to do this."" And I knew if I got discharged Id use. So I decided to take control and made a decision to leave of my own accord. I was still heavily scripted on methadone and valium, I hadnt finished my alcohol detox. And I told them I was going. And they said: ""Where are you going?"" And I said I was going to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in London. And they looked at me like I was an absolute lunatic. And I probably was, a bit. It was a big leap of faith. I was homeless because I couldnt go back to my flat because of bail conditions. I went to a meeting in Soho in London. And I sat in that meeting and I asked for help and thats what I got. Three people in that meeting arent with us any more, theyre dead. I really do grasp how lucky I am. After nearly 20 years of addiction and in drugs and alcohol services, the services didnt help me stop using. In fact, if anything I feel they kept me using longer with methadone prescriptions. They never once mentioned mutual aid groups. Their answer every time was more medication, never abstinence. I stopped my script dead and I got clean in the meetings. And I am proud of that. This month I will have been clean for three-and-a-half years. Help with addiction Its not been easy. I got made homeless six months ago which was really frightening, really scary. It was an on-the-spot eviction, I was asked to leave straight away. I didnt know where I was going. I didnt know what I was doing. But I got through it and I stayed clean. I have complex PTSD, which I put down to to the sex working I did during my addiction. It affects every area of my life because I am so easily triggered. But Im determined to recover from it. I didnt come into recovery to be like this. But its manageable. I manage it, to get by. Im rebuilding a relationship with my oldest two children, and this Christmas was the first time Ive had my daughter with me since 2012. I now run womens recovery groups in a day centre and Im doing well at college - I left school when I was 13. No, I dont have a flat. No, Im not in full-time employment. Im living in a hostel, which is challenging at times, very challenging. But every time I look out my window and its raining, gratitude just comes over me that I havent got to go out in that rain and wait for a punter to come and pick me up. Its not perfect at the minute, its not great. But… its all right. Lifes all right. Illustrations by Emma Russell.

"Detox clinics putting patients at risk in England, regulator finds",The regulator has found many residential rehab clinics are not providing safe or good quality care.,,30 November 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images People undergoing detox for alcohol or drug addiction are being put at risk by residential clinics in England - as a lot of the care provided is not safe or good quality, the regulator has found. The Care Quality Commission based its findings on inspections of the 68 independent services over two years. Nearly three-quarters were found to be failing in at least one of the fundamental standards of care. The regulator said detoxification can be ""difficult, unpleasant and risky"". Last year more than 2,600 people underwent medical detox in a residential rehabilitation service in England - about 1% of the total number being treated for drug and alcohol addiction. Lasting around five to 10 days, detox can involve fits and hallucinations, as well as a risk of suicide or painkiller drug overdose. Given this, Dr Paul Lelliott, from the CQC, said he was ""deeply concerned"" because many of the providers of these services in England are not following national clinical guidelines. Safe care and treatment was where the most breaches were found, with 63% of clinics not meeting this standard when they were first inspected. Staff were also handling medications incorrectly, administering drugs such as methadone and paracetamol without the right training or too often. Many clinics were also not assessing safety risks before patients were admitted or following national guidance on how to treat people in withdrawal. For example, in at least one case, the CQC found staff didnt plan how they would manage a persons epileptic fits during their withdrawal, despite knowing they were at risk of having seizures. Many staff were also not given full employment checks or sufficient training. Image copyright Getty Images Dr Lelliott said: ""While we have found some services that are providing good care and we are beginning to see improvements, all providers need to review their practice so that we can be assured that they are delivering safe and effective care. ""Detoxification under clinical supervision is often the first stage of a persons addiction treatment. It can be a difficult, unpleasant and sometimes, risky experience. It is vital that providers get this right to support peoples onward rehabilitation and recovery."" Four of the services are no longer operating. Getting recovery on track Rosanna OConnor, at Public Health England, said: ""While residential detox makes up a small part of the overall treatment system, seeing about 1% of all in treatment, they do have a vital role. ""Its crucial these services are in line with best practice, as the clinical guidelines on drug treatment clearly set out. ""This helps ensure not only safety but gives some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people the best chance of getting their recovery on track."" The CQC now plans to rate the other independent services that treat people for substance misuse. Prof Colin Drummond, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the report ""shows systemic failings in the way these services are provided and that people undergoing detoxification are being exposed to unnecessary risks"".

Larne man avoids prison for attack on Alliance Party office,A County Antrim man who broke into an Alliance Party constituency office with an axe and crowbar is given a suspended sentence.,,23 July 2014,BBC News,"A County Antrim man has avoided prison for breaking into an Alliance Party office with an axe and crowbar. Charles Mervyn Jamison, 39, from Old Glenarm Road, Larne, pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to cause unlawful damage. He was given a 12 month sentence, suspended for three years. The judge at Antrim Crown Court said the act of ""wanton vandalism"" was an ""attack on the right of people to freely hold their political views"". The court heard that Jamison was arrested on 19 July 2013, after police received a report of a ""smashing sound"" coming from the rear of a property on Larnes Main Street. Dislike They entered the property through a broken window and found Jamison inside the main hall of the premises, where an Alliance Party office is also located. A prosecuting lawyer said: ""The defendant was holding an axe and crowbar and was smashing the door and lock of the door to the Alliance Party office. ""He gave the impression of being very intoxicated and was arrested. Asked why he was attacking the office, he said, I just dont like the Alliance Party. ""He admitted during interview that the axe and crowbar were his and he intended to enter the office and trash it. ""He apologised for his actions. He was literally caught red-handed."" The prosecutor added that the incident was not part of a ""planned or orchestrated campaign"". A defence barrister said the incident was ""utterly and completely disgraceful"". ""Mr Jamison works in a fishing tackle shop in the same building and, for whatever reason, which was associated with the consumption of alcohol, committed this offence."" The defence lawyer confirmed to the court that Jamison had worked as a coach builder for ten years but had to give it up after he fell ill with epilepsy. Distress He said he was working part-time and had saved up the money to repay what is owed for the office repairs. ""To show how he has progressed, he has not consumed alcohol since this incident, he is voluntarily attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and he has not come to the attention of the police since."" The judge told Jamison: ""It has been made very clear that you were not part of any orchestrated campaign against the Alliance Party office or the Alliance Party in general. ""That is not to lessen the distress that would have been caused to persons who worked in that office, while you worked part-time in a fishing tackle shop in the same premises. ""There is no doubt these persons and anyone attending the office in which they are entitled to do would have been quite rightly distressed by this wanton vandalism by this defendant."" He added that Jamison had shown an ""element of remorse"" through his early guilty plea and that had he contested the case, the defendant would have been sentenced to 18 months in prison. On top of the 12 month sentence, suspended for three years, the judge ordered the destruction of the axe and crowbar and also granted a compensation order of £1,390 to the landlord of the property.",{},"['larne', 'judge', 'worked', 'party', 'attack', 'incident', 'alliance', 'axe', 'crowbar', 'prison', 'avoids', 'property', 'jamison', 'office', 'man']","A County Antrim man has avoided prison for breaking into an Alliance Party office with an axe and crowbar.

Ex-burglar says 'some people need to be in prison',A prolific burglar with more than 100 convictions says a second chance helped him turn his life around but some people need to be in jail.,,6 September 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Ex-offender Jodie Hind has been in and out of prison since the age of 14 Ex-burglar and drug pusher Jodie Hind has a string of convictions longer than his arm - more than 100. So many in fact, he cannot remember the exact number. He was first jailed for theft on his 14th birthday and for the next 16 years was in and out of prison dozens of times for a ""mind-blowing"" number of offences. At his lowest ebb he was breaking into houses to steal money to feed a heroin and crack cocaine habit. And when things were going ""well"", in his eyes, he was making £1,000 a day selling drugs and spending it on sports cars, jewellery and clothes. But every few months he would find himself back inside. According to the 34-year-old, most people had written him off and did not believe he could break the cycle of crime. But break it he did, with a lot of professional help, and today he is drug-free and has not committed a crime for more than four years. Big baby Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems Jodie Hind On Wednesday Judge Peter Bowers caused controversy when he said burglars were ""courageous"" and decided to give serial burglar Richard Rochford a supervision order instead of jail. The Teesside Crown Court judge also said he thought prison did criminals ""little good"". Mr Hind agrees that jail does not always work, but many offenders still need to be locked up. He said: ""Some people need to be in prison for the safety of the public. Society was better off when I was inside before I had confronted my problems. Image caption Jessie Jacobs said ""the whole area of justice"" needs reform ""I was not facing up to the fact I had character defects and these were were manifesting themselves in addictions such as drug-taking and alcohol. ""I had problems such as managing anger, I was like a big baby, and replacing one addiction with another. ""But I have a conscience and I feel most shame about dealing in drugs. I am also haunted about burgling peoples homes. ""I thought I could cheat my way through life but with lots of help I have turned my life around and changed my way of thinking."" Without hope Through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous and other addiction agencies, Mr Hind now works for Five Lamps, a Stockton charity which helps the unemployed get jobs or start their own business. Mr Hind said his father was an alcoholic but on the whole he and his sister had a good upbringing. But he kept lapsing into crime because he was ""immature and without hope"". The judge could have chosen his words more carefully - burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate Jessie Jacobs, Chief Executive of charity A Way Out He said: ""My recovery was very public. Ive decided to stay in the area where I committed my crimes and a lot of people dont approve of me. ""But I believe in reform, I am accountable for my actions. I am up for what the judge has said, some people should be in prison but the prison numbers are too big. ""I believe with the right help people can be reformed."" Mr Hind is not afraid of having a relapse. He said: ""Everyday I take stock. I have changed my way of thinking. ""I am responsible for my actions and learn from other people who have overcome their problems."" Jessie Jacobs is the chief executive of A Way Out, a charity which helps women and young people to tackle a range of problems including depression, addiction, self harm and exploitation. It has been running for 10 years and helps about 1,000 people a year. Ms Jacobs said: ""The judge could have chosen his words more carefully. Burglars are not brave but they may well be desperate. So while I do not condone the judges choice of words I welcome the fact that he has opened up a debate. ""He said he thought jail rarely worked and I believe we need to reexamine and reform the whole area of justice.

Election Lexicon: The lost significance behind this week’s buzzwords,A look behind some of the words that are making an impact in the general election campaign this week.,,12 May 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright PA Image caption Monsieur Zen (self-proclaimed) Every general election throws up buzzwords and curiosities which help to define the tenor of the campaign. So what words have caught the ear in week one of the 2017 contest? Battle bus Conservative candidates and officials learned this week that they would not face charges for breaches of expenses rules over use of a ""battle bus"". But what precisely is a battle bus? The exterior is grimly familiar: a shiny patina of party logos and rudimentary slogans. But when the battle bus was first used in the UK, its insides were to change politics irrevocably. Rather than have their spouses drive them to campaigning events, politicians of the late 1970s could travel in a six-wheeled office with state-of-the-art equipment - and not just the air conditioning. Heres Margaret Thatcher with some unimaginably futuristic communications technology: Image copyright Clive Dixon/REX/Shutterstock The perks were even greater for political journalists, who no longer had to drive in clumsy convoy with the party leaders or search for telephone booths to file their reports. They too could stay connected - and as the kit advanced to the word processors and ""disc fax"" machines of the 1980s, speech-writing, campaigning and reporting all lived and breathed the same fervid, sometimes foetid, air. Election live: Rolling updates The words ""battle bus"", then, are not just a straightforward term for a mode of transport; they describe an accelerated kind of politics, where candidates are always on-grid and where the media are part of the machine. Everywhere is now a battle bus. And the repercussions were keenly felt by the people most associated with the golden age of the battle bus - Davids Owen and Steel of the the Liberal/SDP Alliance - not least because each had his own bus, replete with period personalised windscreens. Image copyright David Levenson Image caption David Owen and David Steel with their respective battle buses Double the liberal fun - except that the onboard journalists rapidly realised that they could play the leaders off against each other in transit, getting a statement from one and getting the other to ridicule it before realising where it had come from. Perhaps thats why todays Lib Dems have switched their affection to another futuristic conveyance... Hovercraft Lib Dem leader Tim Farron campaigned in a hovercraft this week in Burnham-on-Sea, apparently undaunted by the experiences of Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, who campaigned for the second of 1974s pair of elections using the same vehicle. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim Farron trying a different mode of transport on the campaign trail Reasoning that voters could be found on beaches, Thorpe decided to surprise them by arriving from the sea in a campaign that ended only when colossal waves near Sidmouth nearly drowned the oilskinned candidate and left his hovercraft in pieces on the shingle. At that time, there was one crucial difference about the word hovercraft. It tended to have a capital ""H"", as it was a proprietary term like Hoover or Portaloo. The preferred generic phrase was ""air-cushion vehicle""; others used ""sea-saucer"" until the lower-case ""hovercraft"" took over. Other terms you may not have realised are proprietary include Jacuzzi, Memory Stick, Quorn, Autocue and Rawlplug. Draft manifesto A draft simply means a drawing: a preliminary sketch, loose on the details, while manifesto is supposed to mean ""clear to the eye"" (as in, manifest). A draft manifesto in its very nature, then, is asking for trouble. Labours draft manifesto has been hastily converted to the real thing this week after a leak, which the Conservatives promptly described as ""a shambles"". Shambles has never been a pleasant word: derived from a term for a bench, its original meaning is of that item of furniture as it is found at a butchers: that is, a scene of quite literal carnage. Image caption Malcolm Tucker: Originator of the term omnishambles Worse still is an omnishambles, a term coined by writer Tony Roche for Malcolm Tucker to utter in The Thick of It which rapidly found itself being used by real-life politicians, an embrace which made the shows creator Armando Iannucci ""queasy and uneasy"". Labour has tried to avoid being seen to play a subsequent blame game, a term popularised by Alcoholics Anonymous as a playing-out of recriminations that is best avoided. In that spirit, Jeremy Corbyn has described himself as ""Monsieur Zen"". Zen is the branch of Buddhism which holds that you should look not to scriptures (or perhaps to manifestos), but to a persons own heart. There is no little irony here, given the charge that Labours campaign is stressing the scripture over the man. Which brings us to... Airbrushing In a natty parallel, while Labour is accused of airbrushing Corbyn out of the partys campaign, the Conservatives have been described as airbrushing the word ""Conservatives"" in favour of images of their own leader. Image copyright Getty Images Airbrushing in politics used to be a much more literal business. For a despot to remove a rival from a photograph, all that was needed was a sharp scalpel. But when it came to disguising your skulduggery, the airbrush was your friend, doing as its name suggests and spraying away to cover the evidence. Nowadays, airbrush is used for metaphorical disappearance: if youve been removed from a picture, youre said to have been photoshopped (another proprietary term). Digital tools for altering pictures are much more readily available than was the delicate airbrush, but that doesnt mean that anyone can use them - as Labour candidate Kate Hoey found this week when she tweeted a picture which was missing the head of rival candidate, Lib Dem George Turner - but not his legs. Finally, for now... The big six In all the excitement over whether Theresa Mays energy-cap proposal was a reheated version of an old Ed Miliband policy, word watchers were left wondering: why do we call those energy companies The Big Six? The ""six"" part can be explained by counting them; allow Election Lexicon to explain the ""Big"". The Big Six were originally the Big Four, and they werent energy giants: they were the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St Louis Railway companies of the nineteenth-century US midwest. It made for a snappier nickname than the mergers preferred CCC&StL anyway.",{},"['hovercraft', 'used', 'term', 'lexicon', 'weeks', 'image', 'caption', 'campaign', 'week', 'lost', 'buzzwords', 'word', 'significance', 'copyright', 'election', 'battle']","Image copyright PA Image caption Monsieur Zen (self-proclaimed)Every general election throws up buzzwords and curiosities which help to define the tenor of the campaign.

Communications Bill: Data access 'vital' anti-gang tool,"Government plans to monitor all Britons' online activity will help police to infiltrate criminal gangs, Parliament is told.",,30 October 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Ministers argue law enforcement agencies need to keep pace with changing technology Government plans to monitor all Britons online activity will help police to infiltrate criminal gangs, Parliament has been told. Ministers want to strengthen the law on internet data retention to help the police tackle security threats. Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said access to data could help ""capture people further up the tree"" in organised gangs. Home Secretary Theresa May will face questions on the issue on Wednesday. Under the governments plans, currently being scrutinised by Parliament, service providers will have to store details of internet use in the UK for a year to allow police and intelligence services to access it. New platforms Records will include peoples activity on social network sites, webmail, internet phone calls and online gaming. Civil liberties campaigners and MPs from all parties have expressed concerns about the scope of the new powers. But giving evidence to the parliamentary committee studying the proposals, Mr Fahy said getting access to basic details of who was talking to whom were ""absolutely vital"" in ""proving associations"" between criminals. Data Communications Bill The Bill extends the range of data telecoms firms will have to store for up to 12 months It will include for the first time details of messages sent on social media, webmail, voice calls over the internet and gaming in addition to emails and phone calls The data includes the time, duration, originator and recipient of a communication and the location of the device from which it is made It does not include the content of messages - what is being said. Officers will need a warrant to see that But they will not need the permission of a judge to see details of the time and place of messages provided they are investigating a crime or protecting national security Four bodies will have access to data: police, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, the intelligence agencies and HM Revenue and Customs Local authorities will face restrictions on the kinds of data they can access In his forces fight against organised crime in Manchester, Sir Peter said it was often able to penetrate the top of a criminal gang by linking ""foot soldiers"" selling drugs or stolen goods to those running operations. But he said he was ""very fearful"" about the authorities ability to keep track of suspects in future as they changed their behaviour and used social media and other less traceable channels to interact. ""What you are trying to prove is associations between different groups of criminals,"" he said. ""Up to now we have been able to use the more readily available communications data but criminals are realising that and moving to new technology and platforms. ""We already have specific examples of them using new platforms to defeat us."" Asked to give details of the new methods that criminals were using, Sir Peter said he was reluctant to reveal too much since offenders could be listening to the hearing, but he identified online ""gaming platforms"" as a growing concern. Although many internet service providers were ""very co-operative"" at the moment in responding to police requests for information, others were ""essentially obstructive"", he said, and this needed to change. Privacy risk Giving evidence earlier on Tuesday, a leading IT executive said there were ""big downsides"" to the governments proposals ""in terms of people having their privacy invaded"". Trefor Davies, chief technology officer of business-focused service provider Timico Limited, said high-profile data losses by government departments and banks in recent years showed information held by the state and private firms could not be regarded as totally secure. Citing the example of someone visiting the Alcoholics Anonymous website, he said sensitive information was at risk of being compromised if details of online behaviour were stored on a database and then a laptop containing information was left in the back of a cab. He said: ""This kind of information will escape."" While the industry wanted to help the authorities to ""catch crooks"" and prevent mass terrorist attacks, he said there needed to be serious debate about the privacy implications of the proposals. Privacy campaigner Guy Hosein, from Privacy International, said police and other public authorities already had access to the information, and there was no need for new legislation.

'Major improvement' in open jails,,,2009-01-28 10:02:20,,"The Robert Foye case fuelled concern about open prisons The case of an on-the-run prisoner who raped a schoolgirl has led to improvements in Scotlands open jails, the chief prisons inspector has said. Robert Foye attacked the 16-year-old in August 2007 after absconding from Castle Huntly open prison near Dundee, raising questions about public safety. Inspector Dr Andrew McLellan said procedures had now been tightened. But his inspection of Castle Huntly, and Scotlands second open prison, Noranside, raised several concerns. Delivering his report on the two prisons, following an inspection in September last year, Dr McLellan said they were failing to offer proper programmes to tackle prisoners offending behaviour. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. And he said there was ""almost no preparation"" for inmates in closed prisons for a move to open conditions. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill said he was reassured by the report, adding open prisons were vital in helping offenders back into communities at the end of their sentences. Dr McLellan said no Scottish prison had been the subject of more public concern in the past year than the open estate. He cited public concerns of a lax regime and that open prisons were ""too easy to get into and too easy to get out of"". In 2008, Foye was jailed for a minimum of nine years for the rape, which he carried out in Cumbernauld. Mr MacAskill later apologised to the schoolgirl and ordered improvements to the system. Decisive moment Foye was serving a sentence for attempting to murder a police officer when he absconded from Castle Huntly, after being allowed out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Describing his inspection as a ""decisive moment for the future of the open estate"", Dr McLellan said the Scottish Prison Service had learned lessons and ""tightened considerably"" the requirements for admission to open prison. ""This current inspection report demonstrates that significant change has taken place this year in the open estate,"" his report stated. ""Much of the change can be attributed to reaction to that case of rape by an absconding prisoner."" Castle Huntly aims help prisoners back into the community Inspectors said the absconding rate was still high, but dropping, while the number of short-term prisoners had ""reduced considerably"" in favour of long-term inmates preparing to be released. But Dr McLellan said accredited programmes to address offending behaviour should be introduced, while there needed to be more opportunities for inmates families to better engage with the system before they were given home leave. He said prisoners must be better prepared for moving from closed to open prisons and called for further improvements to community risk assessment procedures. Inspectors issued eight recommendations in all, including calls to improve healthcare facilities at Noranside, in Angus, where milk and coffee was found being stored in the medication fridge. Mr MacAskill said the prison service was already acting on the recommendations. He said of Dr McLellens inspection: ""I am particularly reassured he has found significant improvements in the risk assessment and risk management of prisoners following the Robert Foye case.""

London 2012: Team GB football team begin preparations,BBC Sport catches up with Team GB's footballers as manager Stuart Pearce's side start their preparations for the Olympics.,,2012-07-09 12:49:32,BBC Sport,"While much of the nations gaze on Sunday was focused on historic events at Wimbledon, a few miles north west another unique sporting occasion was taking place. The Great Britain mens Olympic football squad were in Loughborough for their kitting out day - a process that involves every British Olympian receiving the attire they will wear during competition. For the 18 selected it was a unique occasion that coach Stuart Pearce said they would be unlikely to experience again. The group met as a unit for the first time at dinner on Saturday. Mens Olympic football - recent winners Beijing 2008: Argentina Athens 2004: Argentina Sydney 2000: Cameroon Atlanta 1996: Nigeria Barcelona 1992: Spain ""We didnt have to introduce ourselves like at Alcoholics Anonymous,"" Swansea defender Neil Taylor, 23, told BBC Sport. Joking aside, Taylor said the squad would have to ""gel quickly"" with less than three weeks before they begin their group campaign against Senegal at Old Trafford on 26 July. Pearce was given the responsibility of putting together the squad. His selection caused controversy, with the exclusion of former England captain David Beckham from the final 18 and with no representation from Northern Ireland or Scotland. The ex-England full-back had already given his reasons for leaving out London 2012 ambassador Beckham and added on Sunday that he did not pick the team based on nationality but ""on form"". Had he been forced to do so he would not have taken the job. One of those favoured by Pearce, but left out of England coach Roy Hodgsons Euro 2012 squad, was Manchester City full-back Micah Richards. Does he have a point to prove? Man Citys Micah Richards is hoping to repay Pearces faith in him. ""No. Of course, as footballers you want to play at Worlds Cups. This is an added bonus and will probably never happen again, so to be part of this is amazing,"" said the 23-year-old. ""Pearce gave me my debut at City, then when he got the England job for a game, he played me. I have so much respect for him and will give all for the man who gave me a chance."" Someone who did make the Euro 2012 squad was goalkeeper Jack Butland. The Birmingham teenager, who spent last season on loan at Cheltenham, was a late call-up by Hodgson, following an injury to John Ruddy, and will be vying with Middlesbroughs Jason Steele for the keepers jersey at London 2012. ""The Euros was a fantastic experience,"" he said. ""It would have taken a miracle to play out there. I was going as back-up. Thats probably the main reason I am here - the fact I didnt play."" Other positions that will be hotly contested will be those in midfield, with Arsenals Aaron Ramsey, Manchester Uniteds Tom Cleverly and Swanseas Joe Allen all fighting to play alongside captain Ryan Giggs. All were in buoyant mood, although Tottenham left-back Danny Rose had mixed feelings about spending time away from White Hart Lane, where he - and team-mate Steven Caulker - could be making an impression on new boss Andre Villas-Boas. ""I want to show what I can do. It had been agreed by Spurs that I could go on a season-long loan deal to a Premier League club, but that was before manager Harry Redknapp was sacked,"" he said. ""Its a great achievement being here, but at the same time theres a new manager at Spurs and all the lads will be making impressions on him while me and Steve will be here. But I am delighted about being part of this.""",{},"['football', 'team', 'begin', 'unique', 'taken', 'probably', 'london', 'england', 'preparations', 'pearce', 'play', 'gb', 'spurs', 'olympic', 'taylor', 'squad']","The Great Britain men's Olympic football squad were in Loughborough for their kitting out day - a process that involves every British Olympian receiving the attire they will wear during competition.

The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) confirmed Noranside prison, in Angus, will be mothballed for a week over the festive period. The prison currently has about 100 inmates. Any prisoners not eligible for Christmas leave will be moved to nearby Castle Huntly prison. The SPS said the prison had also closed last Christmas. It is not known how many prisoners will be given leave. The spokesman added: ""That is the plan at the moment - we did that last year. ""The numbers in the open estate are quite low, but if you have prisoners in the open estate and they have been risk assessed, it makes sense that gets tested. Many victims and families of those killed, are still bearing emotional or physical scars and will have to watch in horror as they are sent home to enjoy a week with their families John Lamont Scottish Conservative MSP ""That is part of the parole process. If the prisoners misbehave or breach their conditions they are back in closed conditions."" The larger Castle Huntly, near Dundee, would be able to accommodate the reduced open population from Noranside over the festive period on its own. Serious offenders, including killers coming towards the end of their sentences, could be among those released. But Tory community safety spokesman John Lamont branded the plans ""quite incredible"". He said: ""Many victims of these criminals, and families of those killed, are still bearing emotional or physical scars and they will have to watch in horror as they are sent home to enjoy a week with their families."" Political rows A Scottish government spokeman said: ""Only prisoners that have undergone a stringent risk assessment, conducted by the Scottish Prison Service, will be considered for being tested in home conditions - one of the vital functions of the open estate - over the Christmas period. ""These prisoners have already been subject to rigorous assessment prior to their progression to open prison."" The open estate has been at the centre of political rows in recent years. Sex offender Robert Foye absconded from Castle Huntly in 2007 after being let out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and raped a 16-year-old girl before being recaptured. This led to a tightening of controls over who is sent to open jails. But this year murderer John Brown and armed robber Brian Martin - dubbed ""the Hawk"" - both absconded in quick succession from Castle Huntly.

Naomi Campbell wins privacy case,,,2004-05-06 11:56:31,,"Miss Campbell will receive the High Court damages of £3,500 By a three-to-two majority, the Law Lords overturned an Appeal Court ruling that the Mirror had been justified in publishing information about her. Miss Campbell had objected to the publication of pictures of her leaving drug addiction treatment in early 2001. The Appeal Court had ordered her to pay the papers £350,000 legal costs after overturning a High Court ruling. Lord Hope, who voted in favour of Miss Campbell, said on Thursday: ""Despite the weight that must be given to the right to freedom of expression that the press needs if it is to play its role effectively, I would hold that there was here an infringement of Miss Campbells right to privacy that cannot be justified."" It is not possible to sue for invasion of privacy in Britain, but experts say the ruling could have serious implications for the way the media covers the private lives of celebrities. This is a very good day for lying drug-abusing prima donnas who want to have their cake with the media, and the right to then shamelessly guzzle it with their Cristal champagne Piers Morgan Daily Mirror editor The case centred on the publication in February 2001 of a report about her drug addiction, including a photograph of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in Kings Road, Chelsea. Miss Campbells lawyer Keith Schilling said the supermodel was ""delighted"" with the ruling. ""It is not only a vindication for her personally but, more importantly, represents a real advantage for the rights of people to maintain important elements of their privacy, particularly when related to therapy and people who need to have treatment."" The Law Lords reinstated the High Court award of £3,500, based on breach of confidentiality and breach of duty under the 1998 Data Protection Act. The judgment leaves the Daily Mirror facing a total legal costs bill of more than £1m. Lords Nicholls and Hoffmann said they would have dismissed Miss Campbells appeal and found for the Mirror. Lord Hoffmann said: ""From a journalistic point of view, photographs are an essential part of the story. ""The picture carried the message, more strongly than anything in the text alone, that the Mirrors story was true.""

High Court orders £3,500 damages from Mirror Oct 2002: Appeal Court overturns High Court ruling May 2004: Law Lords overturn Appeal Court decision, reinstating High Court ruling and damages Law Lords ruling Commenting on the judgment, Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan said: ""This is a very good day for lying drug-abusing prima donnas who want to have their cake with the media, and the right to then shamelessly guzzle it with their Cristal champagne. ""Five senior judges found for the Mirror throughout the various hearings in this case, four for Naomi Campbell. Yet she wins. ""If ever there was a less deserving case for creating what is effectively a back door privacy law it would be Ms Campbell, but thats showbiz."" Media lawyer Mark Stephens told BBC News 24 the privacy laws in Britain remain ""incredibly confused...and the judges have been grappling with it"" as evidenced by the split decision. ""The much hoped-for clear guidance on the law of privacy hasnt yet been put forward. The law will remain in a state of flux for some considerable time yet."" Celebrity publicist Max Clifford said the ruling would not make any difference to newspapers wanting to publish such pictures in the future. ""Editors will look at every situation and judge them on their own merits,"" he told BBC News 24. He said that it was unlikely the government would introduce a privacy law as such a move would antagonise the press.

The Secret Footballer: I want to 'out' myself - but fear I'll be sued,"The Secret Footballer says ""everyone wants to out"" him. He would even quite like to do it himself but fears legal action.",,2018-04-10 10:56:45,BBC Sport,"The Secret Footballer thought about taking his life during a thunderstorm He is the former Premier League footballer behind four anonymous books which give behind the scenes insight into the game. But the self-styled Secret Footballer says people are desperate to ""out him"". He admits he would even quite like to do it himself - but the fear of legal action and bankruptcy are the things keeping the Secret Footballers identity a secret. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 lives At Home With Colin Murray, he discusses the time he tried to be hit by lightning, and breaking his five-year abstinence to share a drink with famous chef Keith Floyd. If I stand under that, that will be it The Secret Footballer was still playing as late as 2011. He is English, has played for at least two Premier League clubs and was relegated from the top flight on the final day of the season. He once booked out the top floor of a hotel in Paris because he heard that someone he didnt like was staying there. After he stopped playing, he started a column, and wrote four books. In 2010 he was diagnosed with depression and at one stage he considered taking his own life after struggling with mental health. I was really low. We lived next to a farmers field and there was a power cable that runs across the field with a big power box in one corner. My wife was out and I remember walking out of the house in just my football shorts and there was all this thunder and lightning around me. I had no top on and I was barefoot. There was one beautiful oak tree in the middle of this field and I remember walking towards that thinking ""if I stand under that, that will be it"". As I was walking towards it, this bolt of lightning hit the power box and it exploded. It was spectacular. It knocked all the power out in the houses and that snapped me out of it and I went back inside. I told my wife a year later what happened but by then I was kind of coming out of it. If I had got to that tree and that was that, at that moment I would not have cared. The more money around, the more anxious it makes you The former Premier League footballer believes his writing saved his life and steered him away from the temptations of alcohol following his career. He talks about the difficulties faced by those who leave the game, be it alcoholism, divorce, or mental health issues. What you should consider is that when you retire on the Sunday, by the Monday you lose all your mates and all the admiration of the fans. Everything goes off the cliff. Football is completely irreplaceable. The moment you stopped, all the temptation was there. I didnt drink for five years but one of my heroes, Keith Floyd, was doing a show at a theatre and I couldnt not have a glass of wine with Keith Floyd so that was what broke my ban. The more money around the more anxious it made you, and you get paranoid about everything because if you dont have anything you have nothing to lose. You have got to try and keep yourself stimulated. I was lucky that the writing actually gave me something to do. Keith Floyd shared a glass of wine with The Secret Footballer They are going to make a TV drama on the books The Secret Footballer grew up on a council estate in rural England and only began playing organised football relatively late. He signed his first professional terms at the age of 21 and had what he describes as a lucrative career. Since retiring, though, he has become more prominent - albeit anonymously - with a column in the Guardian, the publication of his books and, potentially, a television drama. Some of the most interesting ex-players I have met do not have a profile. I think that the secret footballer was a good idea and one that was well worth exploring. There was an explosion in help for mental illness after the first book and the Football Association and the Professional Footballers Association decided to act on it, so Im kind of proud of it. But I think I ran away with it without thinking where I wanted to take it. Everyone wants to out me but only Im going to do that. The issue would be a legal one and I would probably have to bankrupt myself in order to survive. You have to prepare for the worst and, while there are no names in the books, theres a lot of money in football and a lot of people with a lot of money. They dont even have to be proved right they just have to put a case on. My autobiography will sell on the back of me outing myself but I cant do it at the moment even though I want to.

On the trail of George Orwell’s outcasts,"Retracing Orwell's footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty he identified - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were 80 years ago.",,6 August 2011,BBC News,"Image copyright Other Image caption Orwells narration begins in the street he called the Rue du Coq dOr, in the 5th Arrondissement, where he once lived Some 80 years after George Orwell chronicled the lives of the hard-up and destitute in his book Down and Out in Paris and London, what has changed? Retracing the writers footsteps, Emma Jane Kirby finds the hallmarks of poverty identified by Orwell - addiction, exhaustion and, often, a quiet dignity - are as apparent now as they were then. ""Quarrels, and the desolate cries of street hawkers, and the shouts of children chasing-orange-peel over the cobbles, and at night loud singing and the sour reek of the refuse carts, made up the atmosphere of the street…. Poverty is what Im writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum."" Image copyright bbc Tomber dans la misere (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals Emma Jane Kirby Such was George Orwells recollection of what he called the Rue du Coq dOr in Paris, 1929 - the real-life Rue du Pot de Fer. Today its pleasure rather than poverty that defines the Latin Quarter that Orwell frequented 80-odd years ago. The chic pavement cafes are full of contented-looking people leisurely sipping their vin rose, and the air is perfumed by the sweet smell of crepes and tourists money. But poverty hasnt left Paris - shes simply changed address. She may not look quite the same as she did in the 1920s but if Orwell were to meet her again on these streets, hed know her straight away. And I doubt hed find her greatly changed... Poverty came knocking on Claudines door five years ago when she was made redundant. She leans in close to me as she talks, her right hand often rising to her mouth as if it wants to censor the words that her lips keep forming. ""Tomber dans la misere"" (falling into misery), is the phrase she whispers most and I notice her breath is sour like someone who diets or skips meals. ""We dont eat lunch,"" she tells me. ""Its just my little way of economising."" She nods down to her bulging shopping caddy. ""Its enough for my familys dinner,"" she says, ""but not enough for two meals a day."" Shame Claudine and I are sitting in a big warehouse in the north of Paris, which serves as a food distribution centre for the citys chronically poor. It reminds me of the sort of indoor market you find in the less salubrious quarters of former Soviet states - mountains of unbranded pasta and rice piled on tables, misshapen, anaemic-looking vegetables wilting in crates, biscuits and chocolate wrapped in such bland, stark white paper, that not even a child could be excited by its contents. Download the tablet version PDF download On the trail of Orwells outcasts [186 KB] Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader We watch the steady line of people, Europeans, Maghrebians and West Africans, methodically trudging from table to table, collecting their rations and stuffing them quickly into a pram hood or caddy. Despite the animated cheerfulness of the staff, I notice not one of the customers meets their eye as they take the food parcels. Shame, Claudine - who is French - tells me, is what links everyone here. Shes told no-one that her weekly shop is a hand-out and she doubts anyone else here has admitted it either. The secrecy thats attached to poverty is one of the first things that struck Orwell. ""From the start,"" he wrote, ""it tangles you in a net of lies and even with the lies you can hardly manage it."" Orwell the down and out Image copyright Getty Images Orwell was born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in eastern India, the son of a British colonial civil servant. He was educated in England and, after he left Eton, joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, then a British colony. He resigned in 1927 and decided to become a writer. In 1928, he moved to Paris where lack of success as a writer forced him into a series of menial jobs. He described his experiences in his first book, Down and Out in Paris and London, published in 1933. In Paris, he washed dishes at the overpriced ""Hotel X"", in a filthy, hot kitchen. He met ""eccentric people - people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent"". Milly is fighting poverty with a fierce, indignant energy. A bilingual secretary from Cameroon, she is immaculately dressed and has the practised deportment of a society debutante. In the drop-in centre where I meet her, she looks decidedly out of place next to the dusty, weary figures that are slumped beside her. Appearances, she tells me, are everything if one is to cling on to ones dignity. She agrees to talk to me but only in a private room so that the other people here wont realise that her situation is as bad as theirs. When the door closes she tells me that shes homeless and last night she slept on a veranda. Milly is facing deportation. She came here legally but after she fell ill and had to stop working, her carte de sejour - the papers that allow her to stay and work in France - were revoked. She admits that she is homesick but is terrified to return to Cameroon empty-handed. I ask her if her family know shes homeless and she throws her hands up in the air and rolls her eyes in horror. ""It would kill them,"" she tells me. ""They would drop down dead with shame."" Aching all over When I meet Modi from Mali, he looks as if he might drop down dead with fatigue. Like Orwell, Modi is a plongeur, a washer-upper in a big restaurant and he works six days a week, 12 hours a day cleaning pots and pans. When we talk in the bar of a neighbouring restaurant, his head keeps drooping onto his folded arms and it seems to be such an effort for him to articulate his words that he either slurs them all together in a gluey, glottal jumble, or shoots out small phrases in tiny bursts of energy that fizzle out before the last word has been formed. Orwell complained that when working as a plongeur he felt as if his back were broken and his head ""filled with hot cinders"". Modi agrees that he aches all over and at the end of the day he cannot feel his feet. Because rent in Paris is too expensive, he lives an hours train ride outside the city. Although after midnight the trains are slower so it takes two hours for Modi to get home. He gets up at 0700 and gets to bed at 0200. Most plongeurs in Paris these days are either Pakistani or West African. I stop asking myself why that is, when Modi tells me how much he is paid - just under 4 euros (£3.50) an hour. Hes working, of course, ""on the black"". ""The last time I had a night out,"" he says flicking through a virtual diary in his brain, ""was... last year."" Madame Jolivet can have as many nights out with friends as she wants to - her problem is shes not allowed to have any nights in with them. Image copyright Other Image caption Madame Jolivets tiny B&B room costs 1,730 euros a month The rules of her B&B state clearly that visitors are not permitted, but I have managed to frighten the landlady into admitting me by pretending to be an official from the local authority. Now Im standing (albeit slightly stooped) in her fusty-smelling attic apartment. I am Madame Jolivets first visitor in six years and she is laughing hysterically at having won this tiny victory over her hated landlady. I tell her that in Orwells day, the residents in his filthy hotel used to yell ""Vache! Salope!"" (""Cow! Bitch!"") at their landlady, and Madame Jolivet doubles up with mirth as she mimes the insults at the sky-light. Then, quite suddenly, she looks sick with fear and switches the TV on at a high volume, motioning to the door and telling me the landlady is probably listening at it. Shes right. We hear her tread softly back down the stairs. Orwells hotel room was infested with bugs - Madame Jolivets is infested with mice. Shes tormented by their scratching at night. Shes caught them on camera during the day, and once she found one in her fridge. She complained to the landlady who warned her that if she mentions it again, shell kick her out - after all, shes already been warned that her daughters voice is too loud. Madame Jolivet is a large lady and she squeezes herself round the tiny space of her apartment. When shes at the sink shes jammed between the bed and the table, her body painfully curved sideways to avoid smacking her head on the sloped ceiling. The landlady charges 1,730 euros (£1,500) a month for this space which she rents out as a 16 sq m apartment. Recently the police did a spot check on Madame Jolivets apartment and recorded the actual habitable surface area as just 5 sq m - thats the size of about six or seven beach towels. Madame Jolivet lives here with her grown-up son and daughter. Until last year her other daughter lived with them, too, but she tried to kill herself twice and is now in psychiatric care. Although its miles from the hostel where shes staying tonight, Milly, the dignified lady from Cameroon offers to come with me in the taxi to the Gare du Nord where Im catching my train home to London to make my next step of Orwells journey. ""In my country,"" she smiles, ""we never let a traveller start a journey alone."" Shes very jolly in the cab, reminiscing about her family, her sister in London, the present she sent her nephew in America last year. By the time we get to the Eurostar terminal Ive completely forgotten that Millys homeless and I realise with a real physical shock that this is exactly what she wanted, that she wanted me to see her as she was before poverty possessed her - a very proper, very animated, valuable woman. She waves me off, her whole body swaying into the gesture, in that exaggerated way that small children say goodbye. Each time I turn, shes still there, both arms in the air, her head following the rhythm. Sitting in my seat on the train, my eyes closed, I can see her still. The last line from a Stevie Smith poem comes into my head: Not Waving but Drowning... Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell closely studied the tramps of London ""There exists in our minds,"" wrote Orwell, ""a sort of ideal or typical tramp - a repulsive, rather dangerous creature, who would die rather than work or wash, and wants nothing but to beg, drink and rob hen-houses... I am not saying, of course, that most tramps are ideal characters; I am only saying that they are ordinary human beings, and that if they are worse than other people it is the result and not the cause of their way of life."" Five minutes inside the soup-kitchen in Hackney, east London, and I immediately understand what Orwell meant - that the ""typical tramp"" does not exist. The ""service-users"" - as the volunteers here call them - are a truly disparate group - some look as if theyve just stepped off the tube after a busy day at work, others are unkempt and smell feral. Some are evidently fighting a losing battle with drugs and alcohol, while others look more in keeping with an old folks home. A well-spoken woman who is far more elegantly dressed than I am, and whom I take to be a doctor, confides in me her concerns about the well-being of a schizophrenic service-user she recently escorted to hospital. She then confounds me by sitting down to eat the free meal. A man with a carefully oiled black quiff is introduced to me by a grinning volunteer as Shakin Stevens. I smile conspiratorially with him at Shakys delusions and am later told by the service manager that the volunteer, himself, is delusional and has been coming here to eat each week for years. Image copyright bbc Image caption Todays down and outs are known as service-users Misfits What was it that Orwell said? ""Change places and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief?"" I am instantly struck by the civility of the meal time. A tattooed and very inebriated punk knocks over an elderly ladys walking frame as he staggers to find a free seat. He apologises, asks if the seat beside her is taken and then appears to engage her in polite conversation. When he is served a plate of Mediterranean vegetable pasta by the charming French chef, he thanks her profusely and leaning towards the Polish man opposite him asks if he would kindly pass the salt? As I pour tea and coffee, an emaciated black man in a filthy sweatshirt shakes my hand warmly and asks me how Im doing today? Societys misfits, fitting in. So thats what you think is it? Im just yet another homeless drunk? Grant Its here I meet Stuart, who is currently on a methadone programme and who has serious mental health problems. Physically abused by his father, Stuart was put into care in the North East of England, where he claims he was then systematically sexually abused until he gathered the courage to run away to London at the age of 15. Aside from a brief respite of a year or two when he had a council flat, the London streets have been the only home hes known. He is now 40. I ask him to tell me what he remembers about those early years sleeping rough. He doesnt miss a beat before replying, ""Crack, heroin, begging, robbing, stealing and mugging"". An entire life, reduced into just six words. Grant on the other hand can talk the hind legs off a donkey but he prefers to steer clear of personal details, claiming there are many people worse off than him. He zooms through his life story with a dismissive wave of his hand - adopted, never held down a relationship, used to work in social care, lost his job, lives in a hostel, spent a long time in hospital after being brutally attacked on the street. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Orwell did the rounds of the night shelters and soup kitchens of London He leaves out the part about his fairly evident problems with alcohol and when, three weeks into our acquaintance, I ask him about that side of his life he snarls defensively, ""So thats what you think is it? Im just yet another homeless drunk?"" Grant is articulate and funny. Hes wary and prickly, yet sensitive and compassionate. He likes Orwell but prefers Jack London. When my questions become woolly, he pulls me up for being unfocused and he is constantly re-assessing and re-evaluating his own beliefs and opinions. Twice after our meetings he has sent me text messages, apologising for sounding grumpy. When we talk late in the evening, he suddenly checks his watch and becomes concerned about how Im going to get home to the other side of London. When I ask what keeps him going in life, he gestures towards the volunteers who are clearing up the kitchen. ""Belief in your fellow mans goodness,"" he says. ""Because by and large people are good, arent they?"" Recession Orwell always defended tramps reputation as ""drunks"", pointing out that none of the tramps he knew had any money with which to buy beer. But today alcohol is cheap and features heavily in the lives of many of those on the streets. Not least in the lives of the many Poles who came to seek their fortunes as labourers in the UK when the borders opened in 2004. When the recession bit and the building sites closed, they had limited access to benefits and quickly found themselves homeless. The volunteers in many of the drop-in centres and soup kitchens I visit in London tell me that around a good third or even half of their service-users are now Polish. As one careworker put it, theyre ""Orwells latter-day Irish tramp"" - Catholic, slightly on the fringe of the London homeless community, and plagued with a ""great thirst"". London Image copyright Getty Images In London, the narrator lives as a tramp, stopping off in a variety of accommodation - lodging houses, tramps hostels and Salvation Army shelters. He meets a number of characters, including Bozo, a pavement artist, storyteller and philosopher, who is adept in the technique of begging. One chapter is devoted to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Zibbi, whos in his early 40s came to the UK seven years ago, where he got work in a salad factory in Peterborough. For nine months life was ""good-good"", he tells me in his broken English. ""Good-good, because Zibbi is good and Zibbi no drink."" Zibbi refers to himself almost entirely in the third person, as if while talking to me, he has stepped outside of himself and has become a detached observer, albeit with an anthropological curiosity in his own behaviour. ""Do Zibbi drink today?"" he asks me. By the look - and smell of Zibbi - he does little else but drink these days. His face has bloated and taken on the colour of ripe plums, his hands shake and the sharp stench of pure alcohol from his breath overpowers even the acrid, vinegary smell of his clothes and the odour of hot grease from his recent fried breakfast, which still hangs in fat little globules in his beard and moustache. He shakes his head. ""Oh, lady,"" he says, ""Zibbi drink not a little drink, Zibbi drink and drink. He drink vodka til…"" (he makes a gesture of passing out). ""Until bang and bye bye. Game over."" Zibbi blames the heavy drinking culture of his country for his weakness and claims his cousin, Miro, is the worst influence on him, egging him on to have just one more. Frequently he seems to set himself on stage, theatrically acting out imagined dialogue he has with Miro and with his disgusted family. Its like watching a medieval morality play, with the forces of Good and Evil battling for power. Ive thought about [my situation] so many times on the streets - especially when Im alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless Mikael The drop-in centre has set Zibbi up with an alcohol adviser who is trying to help him cut down his alcohol consumption. He talks about her in hallowed terms, and when he whispers her name ""Karen"", he lifts his hands and face to heaven. I suspect shes the only woman he has regular contact with. When I meet Karen later she tells me that shes trying to wean Zibbi off calling her ""Mummy"". I ask Zibbi what he thinks of himself and he looks startled. ""Me? Zibbi?"" he asks uncertainly and his eyes become confused as if hes struggling to connect the alcoholic Zibbi character with the man who speaks his words. ""I… I… I dont know,"" he stutters. He hangs his head and slumps in his chair. ""So tired lady. I… I…"" Not needed Zibbi becomes distressed as he fruitlessly searches for words which might join his isolated personal pronoun and we stop the interview. I realise he has totally lost his sense of self. A few miles east in Hackney, and Mikael, a young, good-looking Pole in his late 20s, has also lost his identity - or at least his identity papers. Someone stole them one night a few months back when hed blacked out in a vodka-induced stupor. Mikael is so softly spoken that hes barely audible at times. He tells me that talking to me is like going to Confession. ""Ive thought about it [my situation] so many times on the streets,"" he says. ""Especially when Im alone, but no-one really asked me before... I feel strengthless and hopeless."" Mikael underestimates himself. A bright man and a fluent English speaker, hes enrolled in an Alcoholics Anonymous programme and, in a bid to stay on track, has made the very difficult decision to eschew the company of his fellow Poles and all other rough sleepers. He is still on the streets but unlike Zibbi, he is wearing freshly laundered clothes and looks fit and fairly healthy. He may not smell of alcohol but he reeks of loneliness. Seven years ago, life was very different for Mikael. He had a legal, well-paid job as a labourer, he had a fiancee, a studio-flat and a gym membership. There were holidays, cinema trips, football matches - there was, as Mikael puts, it a time when he was ""really connected to society… and there was a future"". Then his boss sold his business and moved overseas. Mikael began drinking heavily, lost his studio and his girlfriend. I ask him what he misses most about his old life, fully expecting him to say the obvious things - a hot shower, a comfortable bed, his own food. But Mikael says something quite different. ""I feel like Im not needed by this world. Like nobody needs me,"" he says quietly. ""I miss my girlfriend because I felt then someone needed me. And I felt needed in terms of work."" The evil of poverty, wrote Orwell, is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually. Work, he insisted, is the only thing to turn a half-alive vagrant into a self-respecting human being. Mikael is desperate to find a job believing that work is the yellow brick road which will lead him ""to come back to the normal life,"" as he puts it. Although he admits that its hard to keep motivated when you wake up cold, wet and shattered from a disturbed night in a shop doorway. Mikaels progress is sporadic. He has long spells when hes free of alcohol and then sudden lapses which infuriate him and provoke tirades of self hatred, especially when he imagines what his family back home in Poland would say if they knew he was on the streets. I return to the soup kitchen three weeks later confident of meeting Mikael again but worryingly, he doesnt turn up. I think of the boyish shyness which passed across his face when he had told me that sometimes when he was very lonely he talked to God. The prayer he recited was always the same: ""Hello God - I hope you still remember me and keep some faith in me."" At the end of Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell asks himself what hes learnt from his experiences on the streets and in deference to the great man I shall ask myself the same question. I have learnt how quickly the dry rot of poverty stultifies and festers, crumbling confidence and destroying dignity. I have seen how poverty marginalises, separates and ridicules. And I have understood that the chief cruelty of homelessness is that it doesnt dull the sensibilities of the man sleeping in the doorway but rather spitefully heightens them, forcing upon him so many cavernous hours in which he can burn with shame, ache with loneliness and cry for his mother. Perhaps Mikael sums it up for everyone I have met both in Paris and London when he says, ""You know its so easy to lose everything. But its so, so tough to get it back.""",{},"['im', 'poverty', 'george', 'shes', 'orwells', 'london', 'orwell', 'zibbi', 'paris', 'tells', 'life', 'mikael', 'trail', 'outcasts']","Poverty is what I'm writing about and I had my first contact with poverty in this slum.""

Choice of tipple 'determines different moods',"Spirits may make you angry or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you relax, research says.",,22 November 2017,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Do you know how alcohol changes your mood? Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions. Spirits may make you feel angry, sexy or tearful, while red wine or beer may make you feel relaxed, say researchers. They questioned nearly 30,000 people aged 18-34 from 21 different countries for the study in the journal BMJ Open. All the respondents drank beer, wine and spirits, and many said each type of alcohol had a different effect on them. While having a few drinks can be enjoyable, researchers hope their findings will help highlight the dangers of dependent drinking. Angry outbursts People build up tolerance to alcohol over time and can end up drinking more to feel the same ""positive"" effects that they enjoy. Image copyright Getty Images But they also risk getting negative ones too, says researcher Prof Mark Bellis from Public Health Wales NHS Trust. The anonymous online survey, which recruited respondents via newspaper and magazine adverts and social media, found: Red wine appeared to make people more lethargic than white wine Respondents were most likely to report feeling relaxed when drinking red wine or beer More than 40% said drinking spirits made them feel sexy Over half said drinking spirits also gave them energy and confidence But around a third said they felt aggressive when drinking spirits Drinking spirits was more likely than all other drink types to be associated with feelings of aggression, illness, restlessness and tearfulness Men were significantly more likely than women to associate feelings of aggression with all types of alcohol, particularly heavier drinkers However, the findings show only an association and do not explain the reasons for changes. Prof Bellis said the setting in which the alcohol was consumed was an important factor that the study tried to take into consideration by asking about drinking at home and outside of the home. ""Young people will often drink spirits on a night out, whereas wine might be drunk more at home, with a meal. ""There will be an element of expectation too. Someone who wants to relax might choose to have a beer or a glass of wine."" Image copyright Getty Images He said the way different drinks are marketed and promoted might encourage people to select certain drinks to suit different moods, but that this could backfire if it triggered negative emotions. ""People may rely on alcohol to help them feel a certain way. People might drink to feel more confident or relaxed but they also risk other negative emotional responses too."" Prof Bellis and his colleagues at Kings College London said the findings suggested that dependent drinkers might rely on alcohol to generate the positive emotions they associated with drinking - they were five times more likely to feel energised than low-risk drinkers. He also said the study revealed a difference between men and womens emotional relationship with different alcoholic drinks. ""We got stronger emotional relationships with women across pretty well every type of emotion, except for aggression."" Aggression, he said, was more likely to be felt among men. Dr John Larsen, from Drinkaware, said: ""This study highlights the importance of understanding why people choose to drink certain alcoholic drinks and what effect they expect these drinks will have on them. ""The UK chief medical officers guideline for both men and women states that in order to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to be drinking more than 14 units a week on a regular basis."" That equates to 12 single measures of spirits, six pints of beer or six 175ml glasses of wine a week. Experts say setting a minimum unit price of 50 pence per unit would help cut alcohol-related deaths. A minimum price policy will come into force on 1 May 2018 in Scotland. Legislation to establish a minimum price is currently under active consideration by the Welsh Government and by the Irish Senate. There are no plans yet to do the same in England, although the Home Office says the policy is under review.",{},"['choice', 'likely', 'determines', 'drinks', 'moods', 'alcohol', 'different', 'study', 'spirits', 'wine', 'feel', 'drinking', 'tipple', 'drink']","Different types of alcoholic drink change and shape your mood in different ways, says a study into drinking and emotions.

Moonshine 'tempts new generation',"Moonshine production is gaining popularity, with new generations of distilling clubs and individual operations in many US states, writes Claire Prentice in New York.",,18 July 2010,BBC News,"Image caption Prohibition prompted a surge in illegal moonshine production across the US in the 1920s and early 1930s A growing number of Americans are thought to be getting involved in moonshining - distilling illegal liquor. Traditionally hidden in the backwoods, stills are now going into production in cities across the nation, as Claire Prentice reports from New York. Against the backdrop of the recession and the current craze for artisan produce, illegal distilling clubs and ""kitchen-sink"" operations are popping up all over the US, from California to New York and Pennsylvania. Making and selling moonshine is outlawed in every US state and the police treat distilling liquor without a license as a serious crime. But while official figures are hard to come by, experts believe as many as a million Americans could be breaking the law by making moonshine - also known as white lightning and white dog. Image caption Moonshine has held a place in Americas folk memory since Prohibition days ""Theres been a huge increase in the number of people making moonshine,"" says Max Watman, whose book, Chasing the White Dog, chronicles moonshines colourful history. He says that in recent years, the image of moonshine ""has changed dramatically"". ""The stigma has gone. Its become cool."" Moonshine has occupied a place in Americas folk memory since Prohibition - the period between 1920 and 1933 when the production, sale and transporting of alcohol for consumption were banned across the US. The term moonshine usually refers to whisky but its a catch-all term for any spirit that is untaxed and illegally distilled. High-end mixologists Getting a distilling licence can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. But anyone found guilty of making spirits without a licence faces a fine of up to $15,000 (£9,750) and up to five years imprisonment. If someone is producing illegally distilled spirits and not paying tax then well go after them Arthur Resnick, Federal spokesman Todays moonshiners are a diverse bunch. They include home distillers, high-end ""mixologists"", small businesses making cheap liquor to sell locally and bigger operations which sell across state lines. Though most prosecutions continue to be in the south, many of todays new moonshiners are hipster kids, foodie enthusiasts and hobbyists on Americas coasts, making booze in their kitchens and bathrooms. One Brooklyn resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, makes moonshine to her fathers recipe. She says: ""Growing up, me and my brothers watched our dad make moonshine in the bathtub. Now we do it."" In her 20s and an aspiring musician, she is typical of the new breed of moonshiners. Rigged up in her kitchen is a gleaming copper still which she bought over the internet for several hundred dollars. By day she works in a museum where many of her colleagues know about her illicit hobby. ""Youve got to be careful about who you tell. I wouldnt go blabbing about it to someone Id just met,"" she says. Relentless pursuit Private individuals distilling small amounts at home for their own consumption are unlikely to get caught, although police say they take all tip-offs seriously. Image caption Private individuals can purchase stills to produce moonshine in their homes ""If someone is producing illegally distilled spirits and not paying tax then well go after them,"" says Arthur Resnick, spokesman for the Federal Governments Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. A number of distillers have set up websites and blogs where they anonymously answer questions and give advice to first-timers or anyone having problems. Colonel Vaughn Wilson is one of Americas best known builders of copper stills. He has seen demand double for his stills in recent years. ""I cant keep up with my orders,"" say Col Wilson, who lives in Arkansas and whose stills range from $300 to $11,000 in price. ""Ive shipped stills to every state in the US."" Because prosecutions tend to be made on a state rather than federal basis, there is no record of the number of moonshine convictions made in America annually. But arrests have been made in Kentucky, Georgia and Arkansas in the past month. A man in Bell County, Kentucky, was arrested in June after police discovered 100 gallons of moonshine (378 litres) and 500 gallons of mash on his property. Police said it was part of an ongoing investigation and added that they hoped to make more arrests. ""It will be a relentless pursuit until the end,"" said Doug Jordan, of the Bell County Sheriffs Department. A number of states have set up special moonshine task forces to combat the problem. Arrests are usually made following tip-offs from neighbours or from local stores who report sales of unusually large quantities of sugar, a key ingredient, to the police. Nathan Jones, of the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, says: ""We get cases every month or so. The ones that come to our attention are the big ones."" Lure of illegality Though cases of moonshine causing blindness are mostly a thing of the past, health officials warn of the dangers of drinking contaminated spirits. The authorities will never stop moonshine. They are wasting their time trying Col Vaughn Wilson, Builder of distilling equipment ""You do hear stories of people blowing themselves up but if youve read the basics and are using good quality products then its hard to poison yourself,"" says Mr Watman. The biggest moonshine bust in the United States occurred not during Prohibition but in 2001. Dubbed ""Operation Lightning Strike"", it resulted in the arrest of 26 people in an operation that stretched from North Carolina to Philadelphia. The group had dodged $20m in taxes on 1.5 million gallons of alcohol. For many of todays moonshiners, the appeal lies in the pastimes illegality. Col Wilsons website includes a section entitled ""Beat the law"". He says: ""The authorities will never stop moonshine. They are wasting their time trying.""",{},"['making', 'stills', 'moonshiners', 'wilson', 'americas', 'generation', 'prohibition', 'number', 'distilling', 'tempts', 'moonshine', 'state']","Making and selling moonshine is outlawed in every US state and the police treat distilling liquor without a license as a serious crime.

Pero el programa es también objeto de críticas sostenidas.",,14 junio 2015,BBC News Mundo,"Derechos de autor de la imagen HBO Image caption Una reunión de AA en la serie Los Soprano de HBO. Se cumplen 80 años desde la fundación Alcohólicos Anónimos y, desde entonces, se han creado miles de grupos que copian su método para tratar distintas formas de adicción. Chris Stokel-Walker explora cuál es el secreto del éxito del ""sólo por hoy"". ""Mi nombre es Pedro y soy un alcohólico"". Es una frase que suena familiar incluso para aquellos que nunca han asistido a una reunión de Alcohólicos Anónimos (AA). Pedro se presenta así ante los otros 40 concurrentes a la reunión, que tiene lugar una mañana de domingo en una pequeña sala cerca de la principal calle comercial de Newcastle, en el norte de Inglaterra. La respuesta es una bienvenida al unísono, cálida y entusiasta: ""Hola, Pedro"". Quienes están aquí tienen algo en común: su dependencia del alcohol. Aunque vienen de diferentes sectores de la sociedad y tienen distintas ocupaciones e historias de vida. Derechos de autor de la imagen AP Image caption AA se creó hace 80 años. El formato de la reunión es simple: una presentación, una lectura, el testimonio de un miembro, luego una discusión abierta en la que cualquiera de los presentes puede compartir sus preocupaciones, sus logros o sus pensamientos. Pedro empezó a tomar a los 11 años. ""Para cuando tuve la edad en que se puede empezar a beber legalmente, yo ya era un visitante habitual de los centros de tratamiento de alcoholismo, iba una y otra vez al médico, una y otra vez me llevaban arrestado a la estación de policía"". Ahora, Pedro lleva 34 años sin probar el alcohol y atribuye su sobriedad sostenida a su participación en AA. Los 12 pasos Todos los miembros mencionan el ""proceso de transitar por los 12 pasos"" como uno de los pilares del programa de AA. El primero de esos pasos, publicado cuatro años después de la fundación de la entidad, dice: ""Admitimos que éramos impotentes ante el alcohol, que nuestras vidas se habían vuelto ingobernables"". Derechos de autor de la imagen Narcotics Anonymous Image caption El programa de recuperación de los 12 pasos de Narcóticos Anónimos es el mismo que el de AA. Los 12 pasos son, en pocas palabras, un plan de recuperación para lograr superar la adicción. Ese plan incluye la sumisión ante un poder espiritual superior, el reconocimiento del alcoholismo como un problema que no tiene final, la reparación de los daños causados a las personas afectadas por la adicción y un despertar espiritual a través de la oración o la meditación. (Vea la descripción detallada de cada uno de los pasos al final de este artículo). Fundado por Bill Wilson y Bob Smith en Akron, en el estado de Ohio, AA se desprendió de una organización cristiana estadounidense, llamada The Grupo Oxford. El grupo celebra este año el 80º aniversario del momento en que Wilson ayudó a Smith a salir del alcoholismo: el 10 de junio de 1935 fue la fecha de su último trago. Ese elemento social de AA, la importancia del ""sponsor"" o padrino del adicto, es tan conocido como sus 12 pasos. A la fecha, hay 115.326 grupos afiliados a AA en 175 países, según las más recientes estimaciones de la entidad. Sólo en Estados Unidos hay 60.143. De acuerdo a un estudio de 1998, 90% de los centros de tratamiento de adicciones privados se basa en el modelo estadounidense de los 12 pasos. A cada adicción, su grupo Y los principios han sentado las bases para otros grupos que no tienen vínculos directos con AA. Entre ellos, Narcóticos Anónimos, el más específico Marihuana Anónimos, Jugadores Anónimos, incluso grupos para adictos al trabajo o el sexo. Lea: Cómo superé la adicción a la pornografía Además de los más conocidos para tratar la adicción a la comida, hay otros para quienes sufren el trastorno de acumulación o para quienes tienen una inhabilidad patológica ""para cubrir sus propias necesidades materiales"". Y para los parientes preocupados por quienes sufren adicciones de toda clase, bajo el rótulo Familias Anónimas. Derechos de autor de la imagen House of Cards Netflix Image caption Una reunión de AA en la serie de Netflix, House of Cards. En algunos pueblos pequeños donde no hay grupos dedicados a un trastorno específico se alienta a los pacientes a que concurran a otra reunión de adictos, así sea de otra clase: que los adictos al juego busquen apoyo en una sesión de alcohólicos, por ejemplo. ""Si uno mira el programa de los 12 pasos, la única diferencia realmente se da en la primera parte del primer paso. El resto del programa es un proyecto para la vida"", dice Pedro. ""Los 12 pasos (de AA) son muy aplicables a cualquier otra adicción"", confirma Amy Krentzman, de la Escuela de Trabajo Social de la Universidad de Minnesota, que ha hecho investigación sobre AA y otros programas basados. ""Modifican el lenguaje, pero la lógica es la misma… y tienen el respaldo de otra gente que ya ha transitado esos 12 pasos y ha alcanzado el éxito, lo cual es alentador"". La mayoría de los grupos ofrecen sesiones por Skype, donde la disponibilidad es de 24 horas. ""Ahí hay compañeros siempre dispuestos a escuchar y uno dice lo de siempre, Mi nombre es tal y soy adicto a tal cosa"", apunta el coordinador. La teoría del ayudante Parte del éxito de estas instituciones se apoya también en la llamada teoría del ayudante, acuñada en los años 60. Según Krentzman, contar con una persona destinada a asistir al adicto de manera directa suele ser beneficioso para ambos: da al padrino una sensación de bienestar, que ayuda en su propio proceso dado que muchos de ellos son también adictos en recuperación. Muchas películas y series de TV, de ""The Sopranos"" a ""Mad Men"", ""House of Cards"" o ""The West Wing"", retratan la relación entre el adicto y su sponsor. Muchas veces, los primeros reciben apoyo emocional y espiritual, además de la guía práctica, de parte de sus padrinos. El otro principio es que AA considera el tratamiento como un proceso continuo, que nunca termina. Y que se aborda de un día a la vez: la meta es ir pasando las tentaciones de a 24 horas, ponerse por meta el día siguiente. Derechos de autor de la imagen Getty Image caption AA considera el tratamiento como un proceso continuo, que nunca termina. Esto lo diferencia de otros abordajes a la adicción que ofrecen programas cortos y luego dejan al adicto hacer frente a su vida cotidiana sin mayor acompañamiento. Marihuana Anónimos tiene ""exactamente el mismo formato"", dice Thomas, un miembro del grupo. ""Tiene los 12 pasos y varias historias que demuestran la aplicación práctica de esos pasos, de gente que ha pasado por la experiencia y se ha mantenido sobrio desde entonces"". No es para todos Pero estos grupos que siguen la propuesta de AA no cuentan con el apoyo de la organización central, que se maneja a través de Alcoholics Anonymous World Services (AAWS), dueña de los derechos de autor. AAWS sí otorga permiso para el uso de los 12 pasos. Y los principios tienen sus detractores, claro está. Muchos critican el elemento cuasi religioso, otros el énfasis en la abstinencia absoluta más que la opción de un consumo moderado y controlado. Lea: ¿Qué es peor: un par de copas diarias o una gran borrachera los fines de semana? Un filme, titulado ""The 13th Step"", denunció supuestos casos de abuso sexual cometidos por integrantes de AA que tuvieron por víctimas a adictos asistentes a las reuniones. Pero tal vez la mayor crítica proviene de quienes quieren evidencia concreta de que este programa ampliamente aceptado alcanza resultados reales. ""La evidencia muestra que funciona muy bien para algunas personas"", dice Krentzman. Una revisión de todos los estudios científicos que se han hecho sobre la tasa de éxito de AA, publicada en 2006, encontró que ""ningún estudio experimental demostró de manera unívoca la eficacia de AA"". Lance Dodes, un especialista en abuso de sustancias, escribió en un libro sobre los 12 pasos: ""Alcohólicos Anónimos fue proclamado el tratamiento correcto contra el alcoholismo hace 75 años, pese a la falta de evidencia científica sobre la eficacia de su método y desde entonces hemos seguido sosteniéndolo como válido"". ¿Toda adicción es enfermedad? Otro foco contencioso es que el traslado del programa de 12 pasos a otras áreas da legitimidad social a la idea de que una amplia gama de compulsiones representan enfermedades. Derechos de autor de la imagen Getty Image caption El programa de AA se ha usado desde hace 80 años, pero no hay evidencia científica de su efectividad. Los científicos continúan divididos sobre si la adicción a la comida realmente existe. Discuten si la adicción al sexo es real o no – de hecho, no aparece mencionada en la lista de desórdenes y trastornos mentales de la Asociación Estadounidense de Psiquiatría. Pero, para muchos, el programa es efectivo. ""Funciona por un proceso psicológico, uno espiritual y uno social"", detalla Krentzman. ""Por la manera en que da un sentido de comunidad a la gente, por el hecho de saber que otros sufren lo mismo que tú"". Esto es algo en lo que coincide Jennifer, que asiste a Overeaters Anonymous, para el tratamiento del sobrepeso. Se unió al grupo en 2008, cuando tenía 37 años y pesaba casi 114 kilos. Hoy, con varios kilos menos, atribuye parte del éxito a su relación sostenida con otros compañeros del grupo. ""Las veces que he ido a terapia siempre tenía la sensación de que me daban consejos para probar pero no tenían experiencia de primera mano. Hay algo auténtico en esto de tener a un adicto ayudando a otro adicto"". ""Es un programa muy simple para gente con complicaciones. Que resiste críticas de adentro y de afuera (de la organización), lo que no se puede decir de muchas otras filosofías de rehabilitación de adicciones"", agrega Thomas.

Former footballer jailed after 'bust up' in KFC,"A former Dundee and Arbroath footballer has been jailed for two years after a 'bust up' in a restaurant, while in possession of a knife.",,9 July 2013,BBC News,"Image caption John Carling, a former Dundee and Arbroath football player was jailed at Dundee Sheriff Court. A former footballer was jailed for two years after being arrested while drunk and in possession of a knife. John Carling was arrested by police after a ""bust up"" in a KFC restaurant in Dundee. When taken to police headquarters he was found to be in possession of a lock knife, hidden in his pocket. The 38-year-old, who holds an MBA degree, was a footballer for both Dundee and Arbroath. Fiscal depute Nicola Gillespie told Dundee Sheriff Court that Carling was now an unemployed alcoholic reliant on state benefits. She said: ""At 19:35 on 11 May police received an anonymous call that there was somebody within KFC in High Street that appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, so much so that police were called. ""Officers traced the accused within the premises and he was taken outside. ""He was physically swaying and smelled very strongly of alcohol. ""His demeanour was generally aggressive."" The court heard how Carling had been taken to the station and asked if he was in possession of any sharp items. After Carling confirmed that he was, he was searched and officers found the silver lock knife with a seven centimetre blade within his inner left suit jacket pocket. Ms Gillespie added: ""In relation to possessing the knife he said I bought that knife yesterday - I planned to go hunting with it."" Breached bail Carling, of Dundee, pleaded guilty on indictment to possessing a lock knife and breaching bail on 11 May. He further admitted additional charges of drink driving, twice breaching bail and breaching a community payback order, and was earlier convicted of a charge of being drunk in charge of a car. Defence solicitor George Donnelly said: ""He was once a professional sportsman - this has been a spectacular fall from grace. ""His football career was cut short by injury but he went on to tertiary education, got an MBA and set up a successful business. ""That business involved a lot of socialising and glad-handing. ""Matters began to fall apart in 2008 when his marriage foundered, and now his liberty has been lost."" Disregarded opportunities Sheriff Richard Davidson jailed Carling for a total of 23 months. He said: ""You dont have any sympathy from the court - following your earlier convictions your response was to breach your bail conditions to stay of a sober disposition on two occasions. ""You disregarded the opportunities that were given to you, and finally, when professionals were trying to address your alcohol problems you are found in the High Street with a knife in your possession. ""That was while you were on two bail orders, further flouting the law.

Drug rehab charity Focus 12 expands services in Bury St Edmunds,A Suffolk charity aims to fund its work with drug addicts by opening a new counselling centre for people with depression or eating disorders.,,8 February 2012,BBC News,"A Suffolk drug rehabilitation charity is opening a new therapy centre to help fund its addiction work. Focus 12, which is based in Bury St Edmunds, has opened The Annexe for non-addiction related issues such as depression and relationship breakdown. Customers are expected to make a contribution for their counselling. Chip Somers, Focus 12s chief executive, said: ""As the cuts start to really hit, more people are going to get stressed and anxious."" Last year Focus 12 lost its contract to provide treatment services for the Suffolk Drug & Alcohol Action Team to another charity called Open Road.

Anonymous donor The charity, whose patrons include Boy George and Russell Brand, said it costs £0.5m a year to run. The Annexe on St Johns Street has been given £28,000 in funding from an anonymous donor, which will keep it going for two years. Clients are expected to make a payment of up to £45 for a counselling session. Mr Somers said: ""Were well known for our addiction work, but what has been lost in that is that we see perhaps 25-30 people a week [for non-addiction issues]. ""We would fit in alongside services like Mind or Relate, who are very busy, and we might be able to provide a quicker response.

Man caught drink driving at Dunoon Police Office,A man arrested for drink driving is caught again two days later as he drove away from a police station.,,20 December 2010,BBC News,"Image caption Police have arrested 119 people during the second week of their campaign A man arrested for drink driving was caught again two days later as he drove away from a police station. The driver had gone to Dunoon Police Office to produce his documents when officers noticed he smelt of alcohol.

Blue light crews abused by drunk people,"Staff survey of police, fire and ambulance personnel reveals full extent of alcohol misuse in incidents attended by emergency crews.",,24 August 2016,BBC News,"Image caption Ambulance crews reported being assaulted, spat at and verbally abused on emergency calls Two-thirds of emergency service workers were punched, threatened or spat on while they dealt with incidents over a four-week period, new figures reveal. A staff survey has shown alcohol misuse is a contributory factor in about half of 999 calls. It is the first time the police, fire and ambulance services have come together to highlight the problem. They said alcohol-related incidents tied up resources which could be needed elsewhere. The staff survey, completed by 909 police officers, 824 paramedics and 167 fire officers, revealed one in three had been subjected to physical abuse in the previous four weeks while attending an incident as a result of alcohol misuse, and two-thirds had experienced verbal abuse. Almost half of all incidents attended by the emergency services in that period were alcohol-related, while almost two-thirds of emergency personnel had faced difficulties in securing urgent information because of victims or callers being intoxicated. Punched In the anonymous survey one firefighter recalled: ""I was in breathing apparatus at a house fire and I found a man lying in his bed. He had tried to cook after coming back from a night out but he was drunk and fell asleep. ""The smoke alarm was blaring but he only woke up when I shook him to see if he was alive. He punched me in the face."" An ambulance crew member said: ""I have been assaulted, spat at and verbally abused too many times to mention. ""If people could only see the effect they have on an incident when theyre under the influence of alcohol. We have to spend as much time looking after our own safety as looking after our patient."" Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams, of Police Scotland, said the demands placed on emergency services by people under the influence of alcohol were huge. He said: ""On many occasions, it delays police officers, firefighters and paramedics from getting to members of the public who really do need our protection and help."" Assistant Chief Officer David McGown, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said 999 calls from intoxicated people often gave confusing details of the incident. ""Being unable to get reliable, accurate information also means that firefighters can be sent to incidents without vital information regarding people involved and the risks they may face,"" he said. ""When someone is trapped in a fire this could mean our teams may not know where to focus their search, which therefore exposes them to dangerous environments for longer as they attempt to locate the person."" Drunk revellers Daren Mochrie, director of service delivery for the Scottish Ambulance Service, said the public would be shocked to hear how frontline emergency staff and control room operators are often abused and obstructed by people under the influence of alcohol. ""Our staff are highly trained specialist clinicians who all too often have to respond to people who are simply intoxicated, delaying their response to patients with a genuine medical need.,"" he said. ""There can also be wider impact on our operations as precious resources often have to be taken off the road to be cleaned after an intoxicated patient has been sick, which takes time and removes an ambulance that could available to respond to a medical emergency."" One response to the survey revealed an ambulance on its way to a life-threatening medical emergency was delayed by drunk revellers who ran into the road and danced in front of the vehicle. Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, gave the charitys backing to the emergency services campaign for more responsible drinking. She said: ""Reducing our overall alcohol consumption, with particular targeting of high-risk groups, will help ease the pressure on our police, fire and ambulance staff.

Drink-drive detections down on previous Christmas period,PSNI say 322 drink drivers were arrested - 38 fewer than in the same period for 2017/18.,,28 January 2019,BBC News,"Image copyright PA Image caption More than 11,000 people were tested during this years operation More than 300 drink-drivers were detected by the PSNI in the run-up to and over Christmas. The figure was down by more than 10% on the previous year. The youngest person detected was 14 years old, while the oldest was 83 years old. According to preliminary figures released on Monday by police, 322 drink drivers were arrested - 38 fewer than in the same period for 2017/18. The 2018/19 winter anti-drink drive operation ran from 30 November until 1 January. More than 11,000 people were tested during the operation. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said one of those drivers was detected at more than four times the drink drive limit, with a reading of 153 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath. The legal limit is 35 mcg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath. Image caption ACC Alan Todd said detections were made at all times of the day Seventy two of the 322 people arrested were women, as compared to 49 out of a total of 360 during the previous campaign. ACC Todd said detections were made at all times of the day on roads across Northern Ireland and that drivers were also arrested for being under the influence of drugs. ""In one incident, after being involved in a collision, a driver was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs. Approximately £3,000 worth of suspected drugs were recovered from the vehicle, leading to the driver being further arrested on suspicion of a number of drug offences. Shameful ""In another incident, police detected and arrested a HGV driver returning to their place of work, having carried out their morning deliveries. ""Its disappointing that despite our repeated and well publicised warnings, a minority of people completely disregarded the safety of themselves and others by taking the shameful and incredibly dangerous risk of driving after drinking."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In December, NI Crimestoppers saw a 65% increase in calls with information about drink driving This years operation was also supported by the independent charity Crimestoppers, which gave the public the opportunity to provide information about drink drivers anonymously. Sue Brew, regional manager for Northern Ireland Crimestoppers, said that during December, the organisation saw a 65% increase in calls with information about drink driving, compared to the average over the previous seven months. ""As we said at the outset of this campaign, by trusting us with your information, youll remain 100% anonymous. Always. We never take personal details and calls cannot be traced. Together we can help protect those you care about."" Checkpoints ACC Todd added that in the months ahead, police ""will continue to use all the powers and legislation at our disposal, including the authorised checkpoints, to detect people who insist on driving after having taken drugs or alcohol"". In December, BBC News NI reported that the PSNI cannot fully enforce tougher drink-driving laws introduced almost three years ago as they do not yet have access to breathalysers capable of testing lower blood alcohol levels introduced by the assembly in April 2016.

"Drinking, sex, eating: Why don't we tell the truth in surveys?",Many people are under-reporting how much alcohol they are drinking. But what else are we fibbing to researchers about and why do we do it?,,27 February 2013,BBC News,"Many people are under-reporting how much alcohol they are drinking. But what else are we fibbing to researchers about and why do we do it? ""I have the occasional sweet sherry. Purely medicinal."" It is a classic British sitcom scene. An inveterate boozer telling a little white lie about how much they drink to a doctor or other authority figure. But the tendency to paint a less-than-honest picture about your unhealthy habits and lifestyle is not just restricted to alcohol. People also tend to kid themselves about how much exercise they are doing. It is understandable that people want to present a positive image of themselves to friends, family and colleagues. But why fib to researchers? After all, the man or woman from the Office for National Statistics or Ipsos Mori cant order you to go on a diet or lay off the wine. It is a question that has been puzzling social scientists for decades. They even have a name for it - The Social Desirability Bias. ""People respond to surveys in the way they think they ought to. It is otherwise known as lying,"" says Kate Fox, an alcohol and drinking culture expert who has done research for both the government and the drinks industry. Image caption The recycling never lies ""People also kid themselves about how much they drink, but it applies to most surveys, which is why one has to use other methods to really find out what is going on."" It is a particular problem when it comes to ""sins"" such as alcohol and food. Britain is one of a handful of nations - including the US - that has an ""ambivalent drinking culture"", says Fox. It is particularly prevalent in countries that have had a strong temperance movement. People respond to surveys in the way they think they ought to - it is otherwise known as lying Kate Fox ""We have a morally charged relationship with alcohol, a love/hate relationship. It is a bit of a forbidden fruit."" In countries with an ""integrated drinking culture"", such as more Latin nations, drinking is a ""morally neutral issue, only marginally more controversial than coffee and tea"". It is easy to see why people would want to make themselves look good - even to a clipboard-wielding researcher they have just met. But what about when the researcher leaves the room? Or hands them a separate questionnaire to be filled in privately? Theyre all tactics used by researchers to try and iron out the Social Desirability Bias. ""You still want to project a positive image of yourself even if the survey is anonymous,"" says Bobby Duffy, managing director of Ipsos Moris Social Research Institute. The gap between the amount of alcohol being sold in the UK and the amount people said they were drinking, was first observed in the 1980s, he says. More from the Magazine ""The news is chock full of surveys. Many are blatant self-promotion and/or statistical garbage. When a womens magazine reports a survey of the nations sexual habits, you might wonder whether its really what the people of Great Britain are up to, or just a good way of selling a magazine."" What the survey didnt say (5 August 2008) ""People have unrealistic expectations about what other people are doing and that does affect how they how they respond. ""They think other people are drinking a lot less alcohol, doing more exercise and having a lot more sex and that changes their view of their own behaviour."" The gap between perception and reality might be particularly acute in the UK, he suggests. Awareness of healthy eating in the UK is among the highest in Europe, yet the country also has the highest obesity rates. The key, says Duffy, is to view survey results as part of a bigger picture - and, he stresses, it is still possible to track overall social trends from self-reported surveys. But if people underestimate how much they drink, do they overestimate how often they have sex? The sex survey has been a surefire way to boost the circulation of a newspaper or magazine for decades. Yet there is anxiety among sexual researchers that they are not as accurate as they should be. Image caption Surveys can overestimate how often couples have sex ""In a large number of these surveys people inflate how often they have sex. They are buying into this idea that great sex is measured by how often you have it,"" says Petra Boynton, senior lecturer in International Health Care Research at University College London. ""We do have an anxiety about trusting sex research generally, partly because of worries over talking about sex but recently more because of the misuse of the survey tool as an advertising device. It is hardly surprising, she says, that journalists and the public dont trust sex research: ""What they see shared in mainstream media is not the careful and more balanced work undertaken in social and health research. ""As sex stories on relationships advice in media are pinned on statistics, then this allows the dodgy PR polls to be used to tell us how we should be having sex and set up ideas about what is normal.""

""You still want to project a positive image of yourself even if the survey is anonymous,"" says Bobby Duffy, managing director of Ipsos Mori's Social Research Institute.
The sex survey has been a surefire way to boost the circulation of a newspaper or magazine for decades.

Government vows to protect women from unwanted penis photos,Women in England and Wales could be protected from explicit smartphone images under government plans.,,6 March 2019,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images The government has promised action to protect women in England and Wales from unwanted images of male genitals on their smartphones. According to a 2017 YouGov poll, 41% of 18 to 36-year-old women had received such images, which they found threatening and distressing. The government - which has banned upskirting - said it would look at options for preventing cyber-flashing. The commitment is part of a crackdown on violence against women and girls. Some smartphone apps allow users to send anonymous pictures to others in their immediate vicinity, meaning women in restaurants, train carriages and other public places are at risk of seeing unsolicited explicit photos on their phones. MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee last year called for ""a new law on image-based sexual abuse which criminalises all non-consensual creation and distribution of intimate sexual images"". In an updated version of its Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) strategy, published earlier, the government said it would look at the committees recommendations and ""whether there is more we can do to address this"". In the YouGov survey, 46% of women aged under 36 said they have been sent a photo of a penis, with 41% saying they had not asked for it. Only 22% of the men surveyed admitted to sending such a picture and only 5% admitted sending an unsolicited picture. YouGov surveyed 2,121 women and 1,738 men (all aged 18-36) between July and September 2017. The government has also said it will commission research into ""what links exist between consumption of online pornography and harmful attitudes towards women and girls"" and the causes, impacts and influencers of body dissatisfaction. Previous studies have examined connections between porn and sexual violence, but the new analysis will investigate whether there is any broader link to harmful attitudes towards women. Other plans explored in the strategy include: A statutory code of practice for employers on sexual harassment Work with online dating apps to raise awareness among users Consider the impact of alcohol on violence against women and girls Develop further measures to support lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender victims The strategy also promises a review of the way sexual offences are handled by the police and the courts, following an ""alarming"" fall in charges being brought. The volume of ""rape-flagged"" referrals from police fell by nearly a tenth in 2017-18, while the number of suspects charged by the CPS dropped by 23%. Convictions were down by just under 12%, although the conviction rate went up slightly. This data includes cases initially reported as rape allegations, but where charges for other offences were subsequently brought. The strategy also sets out plans for research to consider whether, as has been suggested by some academics, ""rape myths"" may be negatively affecting the ability of juries to analyse the evidence and make informed, objective judgements on the merits of each case. Minister for Women Victoria Atkins said: ""Violence against women and girls strikes at the heart of our families, friendships and communities and it is our responsibility to bring light, justice and support to victims and survivors.""",{},"['strategy', 'vows', 'unsolicited', 'protect', 'women', 'violence', 'surveyed', 'sexual', 'support', 'unwanted', 'photos', 'penis', 'yougov', 'girls', 'sending']","Image copyright Getty ImagesThe government has promised action to protect women in England and Wales from unwanted images of male genitals on their smartphones.

Drunk air passenger arrests up 50%,"A survey of 4,000 cabin crew also finds more than 25% had seen drunk passengers risk flight safety.",,14 August 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A House of Lords committee report called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports Arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk at UK airports and on flights have risen by 50% in a year, a BBC Panorama investigation suggests. A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. Meanwhile, more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. The Home Office is ""considering"" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. Barmaids in the sky A total of 19,000 of the Unite unions cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: ""People just see us as barmaids in the sky. ""They would touch your breasts, or theyd touch your bum or your legs. Ive had hands going up my skirt before."" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ally Murphy: ""Drunk passenger tried to open plane door"" In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntary code of conduct on disruptive passengers, which most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The codes advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff were also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appeared drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. One anonymous crew member told Panorama: ""The code of conduct isnt working… were seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. Its the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem."" Alcohol in the air Entering an aircraft when drunk or being drunk on an aircraft is a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment Licensing laws which prevent the sale of alcohol outside permitted hours do not apply to airside sales of alcohol at UK international airports. Bars can remain open to serve passengers on the earliest and latest flights - from 04:00 in some cases About 270m passengers passed through UK airports last year* and about a fifth of all duty-free purchases involved wine and spirits** The Civil Aviation Authority reported a 600% increase in disruptive passenger incidents in the UK between 2012 and 2016 with ""most involving alcohol"". They say the increase is partly down to improved reporting of incidents Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panoramas undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty free shop to consume on the plane, she was told ""officially probably not, unofficially I think youll get away with it"". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice. World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays ""clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached"". Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passengers own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence. There for one reason Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. ""I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. ""Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, theyre items that are not sold on the high street. ""We cant allow it not to change."" Your tales of drunken passengers: ""One passenger was so drunk he had to have a member of crew do up his seat belt. During landing we had passengers standing up, despite repeatedly being told to sit down. I heard the most despicable things, totally racist and sexist and disgusting."" Nikki Webber ""There was one woman whose language was vile all through the flight with the hen party. The last straw was once the plane had landed, she walked up the aisle and shouted the vilest language in front of my son."" Sharon Richards ""As the plane is landing... the lads remove their (seatbelts) and start scrapping really badly. I looked around and I saw one lad kick the girl behind me. They kicked me and without thinking about it I heard myself shouting really loudly at them to sit down and put their seatbelts back on."" Tania Chambers ""One passenger was so drunk by the end of the flight, he was unable to leave the aircraft unaided by the time we arrived. The departure time was before 8am."" Paul Shah ""I was seated just behind a stag group who had been drinking in the airport and continued to drink duty free clear spirits from water bottles on the flight. The airline staff did not serve any alcohol that flight and moved a family with young children."" David Moult A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: ""We didnt hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon."" The Home Office said it was considering the reports recommendations, which include revoking the airports exemption from the Licensing Act, ""and will respond in due course"". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: ""I dont accept that the airports dont sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem. Its the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly."" She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.

'I've been turned into a hardened gambler',Four people discuss their experiences with high-stakes gambling machines and its impact on their lives.,,26 August 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright PA The UK government recently rejected a plea to reduce the maximum bet on some fixed-odds betting terminals FOBTs on High Street bookmakers. The move was criticised by some, while the government said stronger controls - which give local authorities more power to stop betting shops opening and mean gamblers betting more than £50 per spin have to interact with staff or have an account - were sufficient. We spoke to four people who have experience with FOBTs, including gambling addicts who have lost thousands of pounds on High Street betting machines. Niall, Cheshire I am a recovering compulsive gambler who has been in recovery since June 2014, thanks to Gamblers Anonymous (GA). Over the last few months, I have started to become more active in my GA group and have noticed a huge increase in the number of people with specific problems with FOBTs. This isnt just limited to males, we have a core of female members who have all become addicted to these machines. I never had a problem with gambling until I played these machines. In the end, it took over my life. Fixed-odds betting terminals £1.6bn profit made by bookmakers from the machines in a year* £100 maximum stake per bet £2 what campaigners believe the maximum stake should be £500 maximum win per bet 34,874 number of FOBTs in betting shops in the UK* PA I stole from family and friends in order to feed my addiction and lost jobs due to the amount of time Id taken off of work in order to gamble. I would easily go into the bookies and spend up to eight to 10 hours in there every day. I was deemed a regular in the bookies I went into - but not one person ever suggested that I had a problem. They were happy enough to see me feeding money into the machines every day. I believe this was because I was never aggressive or kicked up a fuss in the shop. I would take my frustration out on my loved ones instead. I am now 15 months clean of gambling. I want people to hear my story now and if it can help one person, then I feel that I have done some good. Terry, Ballymena, Northern Ireland My fixed odds betting has made me contemplate suicide. Ive been playing fruit machines for years. For example, I can spend £2,000 on fixed odds betting in an hour. I got paid today, but Im not going out the door to spend it on FOBTs. Ive lost between £80,000 and £90,000 Terry, Ballymena, Northern Ireland My good friend works behind the betting shop counter. I basically pay his salary. I do it for the flashing lights, and the outside chance of maybe hitting it big. I was up £1,000 earlier this week but I wasnt satisfied and I didnt stop betting. Ive lost between £80,000 and £90,000 in total, which is my whole income. I dont pay my bills anymore. It damages my relationships with other people. I give my money to my current partner, who buys things for me. Ive tried to ban myself, but it wont work. Ive been turned into a hardened gambler. Image copyright PA John from Swansea I work in a high street bookmakers. I see the vast majority of people playing FOBTs gambling responsibly every day. Why should this activity be curtailed because of the problems of a very small minority? I watched a TV programme about a chap who had a problem with FOBTs. The betting shop banned him for his own good and he then went on to blow his money on scratch cards instead. You dont ban alcohol because of a few alcoholics. You can ban or restrict FOBTs easily but it will merely displace the problem of the minority, to the detriment of the majority. Help those minority who have a problem but dont punish the vast, overwhelming majority who gamble responsibly with their leisure money and within their means. Mark I have been a gambler for over 20 years. I have lost jobs because of my gambling. Ive been to prison. Ive been made homeless and tried to kill myself. In my life I have probably lost over £400,000. Since bookmakers have had roulette terminals, I think it has made peoples gambling addictions much worse. I have now excluded myself from many betting shops Mark In the past I used to spend all day in a bookmakers. I once gambled away £6,000, all within two-and-a-half hours. People who could control their gambling on horses and football now find themselves completely out of control. The buzz from the machines is so addictive that it is nearly impossible to stop. I have seen a lot of anti-social behaviour from people using the machines and I know that some staff are told not to report it. I believe the government, like with smoking, will never ban it because they get so much money from it. I have now excluded myself from many betting shops. I printed off letters with my photo and drove around different areas in the middle of the night posting the letters to every betting shop I could find. That way, I know if I want to go into a bookmakers, it means a 70-mile drive to a betting shop outside my self-exclusion zone. Nowadays I use online betting sites where you can control your betting by using deposit limits.",{},"['spend', 'machines', 'shops', 'gambler', 'ive', 'shop', 'fobts', 'betting', 'gambling', 'bookmakers', 'lost', 'hardened', 'turned', 'money']","I've lost between £80,000 and £90,000 Terry, Ballymena, Northern IrelandMy good friend works behind the betting shop counter.

Isle of Man's bid to tackle youth drinking,Examining the problem of underage drinking in the Isle of Man.,,21 March 2011,BBC News,"Image caption In 2009, research revealed that Manx teenagers were some of the most prolific drinkers in Europe ""There is nothing else to do and we cant get in and out of a pretty boring Douglas easily,"" said one Isle of Man 14-year-old, who asked to remain anonymous. ""We want somewhere we can go, where there is not, like, set activities to do, where we can chill with our friends."" In 2009, research revealed that Manx teenagers were some of the most prolific drinkers in Europe. The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) showed that 61% of teenagers drank to excess. Later this year, a follow-up report will indicate whether the situation has improved or not. Since the statistics were made public, the island has made strides to combat the problem. Journalist Tanya Marie Hanson has been looking at the issue. She asked a group of Year 10 students in Ramsey where they got alcohol from. ""Just from parents, out of the house,"" one said. ""You can stand on the street corners, people from the pubs will come out and get it for you. Some will even offer it to you."" Alcohol education in the Isle of Man is being rolled out more and more. Shock tactics Sitting in on a talk between the ""Off-watch team"" and a group of year 10 students, it is easy enough to see the work put in to the schools. The method is brutal with shock tactics and case studies dispensed in equal measure. Pc Steve Stanley, of the Douglas Central Alcohol Unit, spends the sessions talking to the students about his experiences in England when he dealt with teenage alcohol dependency and saw young people killed. He said he was passionate about educating young people about the dangers of dependency. Image caption Teenagers in the Isle of Man receive hard-hitting education about the ill-effects of alcohol Mr Stanley said: ""Its getting more serious now, I mean, its not long off into the future when they can legally drink. I know a few that have reached that age that have already formed an alcohol dependency."" But is all this education having any effect? The only real way to know will be when the follow-up results are published later this year. ""We have alcohol education talks twice a year now,"" said one 14-year-old. ""I think its better that they are saying to be responsible for your friends, theyre not saying dont drink, that would be a bit preachy."" The governments only real chance at addressing a youth binge culture appears to be the provision of low-cost centres to counteract teen boredom.

How to tackle unsafe drinking,Liver expert Dr Nick Sheron explains why we need a blood test to alert people to the health dangers of too much alcohol.,,29 August 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Drinking over recommended limits can cause harm Drinking too much is bad for you. But too many people underestimate what is a safe amount of alcohol. In this weeks Scrubbing Up, Dr Nick Sheron, a liver expert at the University of Southampton, explains why we need a blood test to alert people to the harm they could be doing to their body. We have a serious problem with liver disease in the UK. If you look at the deaths rates, over the past 30 years or so they have gone down in Europe, but have gone up by 500% in the UK. Practically all of this increase is alcohol related and the most important part of the solution lies in an effective alcohol strategy. We need to target cheap alcohol, and a minimum price for alcohol will do this Around a quarter of the UK population are drinking too much, but may not realise it, and GPs have an important role to play here. Liver disease develops silently. There are no signs or symptoms - the liver has no pain fibres, until disease is very far advanced. By the time the patient presents to hospital the liver is often very scarred. Even if the patient stops drinking entirely at this point, it may be too late and many people die of liver complications over the next year or so. This is partly because doctors do not have the right tools at their disposal. The current blood test GPs use looks for liver enzymes that show up some types of liver damage, but not the liver scarring process, so they can be falsely reassuring. Many patients with liver scarring from alcohol have normal liver enzymes, so the likelihood of a GP picking up a problem is small. For patients admitted urgently to the liver unit in Southampton, in about nine cases out of 10 it comes as a real shock to find they have serious liver disease that has not been picked up previously. About eight years ago we decided we needed a simple liver-scarring test GPs could use to detect liver disease in patients. It took us a while, but now we have a simple blood test, which we call the Southampton Traffic Light test. The result comes in three colours. Red mean that you have liver scarring and may even have cirrhosis and you probably need to go to hospital for further tests. Green means we cannot find any liver scarring yet and although the test is not completely perfect, we can say that you are highly unlikely to die from liver disease over the next five years, so there is time to cut your drinking to sensible levels. Amber means we cannot be absolutely sure, but there is at least a 50:50 chance that you have scarred liver, and there is a significant possibility that you could die of it within 5 years. We find that for most patients this is a pretty good stimulus to stop drinking or at least to cut down to safe levels. If more GPs used tests like these we could go a long way towards detecting liver disease before it is too late.",{},"['disease', 'gps', 'tackle', 'test', 'scarring', 'liver', 'alcohol', 'need', 'patients', 'drinking', 'unsafe', 'southampton']","We have a serious problem with liver disease in the UK.

What ideas are there and can they work? Alcohol ban The French government is urging all host cities to ban the sale of alcohol in ""sensitive areas"" near Euro 2016 venues on match days and the eves of match days. This follows the city of Lens - where England play Wales on Thursday - prohibiting any drinking on its streets in the 24 hours before kick-off. Alcohol bans have been tried before but havent always had the desired effect. During the 1990 World Cup there were clashes between police and England fans after sales were halted in Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia. ""This sort of policy can actually provoke a reaction,"" says Geoff Pearson, senior lecturer in criminal law at Manchester University, who was in Marseille when the latest violence occurred. ""Prohibitions dont work with alcohol. Fans can get angry or find a way around it by getting drink from another source."" He also points out that the Russian supporters who charged at English fans inside Marseilles Stade Velodrome didnt appear to be drunk. Image copyright AP Image caption Police used water cannon in Marseille ahead of the England-Russia match ""What I would recommend is that the French police try to do something about bottles of beer being sold,"" says Pearson. ""They were doing this quite well in Marseille. The bars werent serving beer in glass bottles but plastic glasses."" Problems began on Friday - the eve of the match - when bars began running out of beer, he says. Fans started buying bottles from supermarkets, and these were used as weapons, he adds. Mike Layton, co-author of Hunting The Hooligans: The Inside Story of Operation Red Card, thinks alcohol bans might help in some cases but dont get to the root of the problem. ""The hardened criminals dont need beer to stimulate their behaviour,"" he says, ""but others do - those aspiring to become part of the hardcore group and the ones moving around at the back."" Early starts Strongly related to alcohol bans is the policy of moving matches deemed to have a high risk of violence forward by a few hours - say, from 15:00 to midday on a Saturday. The idea is to give troublemakers less time to get drunk during the build-up. The Football Association suggests this as a possible plan. But Layton, who spent more than 40 years policing football violence in the West Midlands, Cyprus and for the British Transport Police, isnt convinced. ""If they are going to fight, they are going to fight,"" he says. ""It doesnt really matter what time of the day it is."" And Pearson says early starts can increase the risk of drunken disorder, with fans coming out of grounds by about 14:00. ""They might then be drinking for another 12 hours, until two in the morning,"" he says, leading to more late-night violence in city centres. Empty stadiums When Manchester City played a Champions League away fixture against CSKA Moscow in 2014, no-one came to watch. Fans were banned, as CSKA were punished for series of offences, including racist chanting. Clubs in Turkey have faced the same sanction following poor behaviour by fans and players. Layton thinks locking fans out of stadiums is an ""option"" for the worst-case scenarios, where violence between rival supporters is expected or has happened recently, but adds that this also punishes the ""vast majority"" of fans who behave well. ""What are people going to do when its on TV but theyre not allowed into the stadium?"" asks Pearson. ""Go to bars. The idea that you want to take people out of what should be a well-manned, secure environment and go to bars that are widely spread out and could turn violent - Ive never heard of anything so ludicrous."" Segregation Image copyright AP Image caption Fans had to escape a charge by Russian supporters after the Euro 2016 game against England The Football Association says having clearly separated areas - a common feature at grounds since the 1970s - ""has significantly reduced problems of spectator misbehaviour inside stadia"". Clubs often create ""sterile areas"", involving fabric netting placed over rows of seats, sometimes reinforced by a line of stewards. But, says Layton, stewards ""need to complement overall tactics, not replace the police officers"", while barriers must be strong enough to keep fans at high-risk matches apart. He backs the use of sterile areas, adding: ""The problem is that it means not selling all the seats. ""But it reduces the costs for hospitals treating injured people and policing. It also helps prevent any costly damage to footballs reputation and image."" At Euro 2016 and Premier League matches there are ""football tourists"", people who come and watch but have no affiliation, or whose affiliation might change even during the match, says Pearson. ""Policing should be a fluid situation. We should be able to put in a segregation line with short notice."" Fan coaching Image copyright Getty Images The ideas mentioned so far deal with the symptoms rather than the causes of trouble. With this in mind, in the late 1980s Belgiums Standard Liege club decided to educate supporters on appropriate behaviour, setting up a programme known as ""fan coaching"". Mimicked in several other countries, it emphasises respecting the opposition and referee and accepting defeat without violence. Layton calls this technique ""diversion"", teaching young people who play and watch football to hold better values. It includes talks from star players and reformed hooligans, who can tell young people that violence leads to injuries and criminal records. Layton thinks the best way to get this message across is to enforce the law. Twenty people have been arrested over the Marseille violence, but he thinks this isnt enough. ""Lots of people have got away with it,"" he says. ""I would have thought, with CCTV cameras, the police would have caught a lot more. ""There needs to be speedy justice in these cases. A lot of football hooligans think that because theyre in a group theyre anonymous. We have to show them that theyre not.""

In pictures: Detroit's abandoned buildings,,,2011-05-13 12:58:48,BBC News,"According to the latest US census, Detroit has lost a quarter of its population in the past 10 years. The decline has left many buildings, like the Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church seen here, derelict. Here is a rare look inside some of the citys abandoned landmarks. All images provided by buildingsofdetroit.com. More than 50,000 students passed through the doors of Cass Tech High School before it closed. Among its notable pupils were singer Diana Ross, carmaker John DeLorean, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Clark Gable was the first person to appear on the screen of the 2,500-seat Eastown Theatre when it opened in 1931. It later became a concert venue with The Who, the Kinks, Yes, and Cream among others playing there. In the 1990s it became a venue for raves, before being taken over by a church group, and finally abandoned. Opened in 1927, the luxurious Lee Plaza residential hotel offered a ""complete home life with all the detailed service of a great hotel added"" according to a 1931 brochure. It later housed Detroit pensioners, before closing in 1997. The waiting room in Michigan Central Station is almost 100ft wide and 230ft long, with 14 marble pillars. During the 1940s, more than 4,000 people a day would cram into this cavernous space. Among those who arrived there were Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin D Roosevelt, Charlie Chaplin and inventor Thomas Edison. Originally a venue for jazz and big bands when it opened in 1928, the Grande Ballroom later became famous as a rock venue in the city. Among those that performed on its stage were Pink Floyd, Chuck Berry and the Velvet Underground. It closed in 1972 and has stood empty ever since. Opening in 1900, the turreted Grand Army of the Republic building was built as a social spot for veterans of Americas Civil War. It was later used for meetings of everyone from Alcoholics Anonymous to dance troupes. Suggestions of what to do with it have included bed and breakfast accommodation, offices and luxury flats. Originally an ornate theatre and cinema - the lobby alone had marble archways and large crystal chandeliers - the Michigan Theatre showed its final movie in 1971, before becoming a rock venue, and finally a car park. Ironically it was built on the site where Henry Ford created his first car, the quadricycle.",{},"['detroit', 'finally', 'marble', 'hotel', 'detroits', 'rock', 'michigan', 'later', 'venue', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'theatre', 'pictures', 'opened']","The decline has left many buildings, like the Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church seen here, derelict.

你是不是工作狂？回答幾個問題就知道,超時工作和無法控制想要工作的慾望並非一回事，但二者界限何在？怎樣才知道自己是不是工作狂？如何確診「工作成癮」症狀？,,2016年 11月 4日,BBC 英伦网,Image copyright Image caption （圖片來源：Alamy） 所有人都喜歡努力工作的員工。 事實上，多工作、多賺錢已經被很多人視作現代社會成功的標誌。能被貼上工作狂的標籤更是被許多人視為一種榮譽。 但對某些人來說，著迷於工作卻需要付出很多代價。健康、人際關係甚至工作質量都會受到影響——代價不可謂不高。 無論如何，強烈的工作慾望多年來已經導致很多人向治療師和自助團體尋求幫助。這甚至會引發過勞死。日本政府本月早些時候發佈的一項研究顯示，五分之一的日本職場人士面臨過勞死的風險。 過勞死不只是日本的問題。工作狂互戒會（Workaholics Anonymous）效仿嗜酒者互戒會（Alcoholics Anonymous）的做法制定了12步法則，他們於今年6月在英國舉行了首屆國際大會，吸引了來自世界各地的與會者出席。 關於工作狂的成因，目前還沒有太多的相關研究。但這種現狀正在改變——最近幾年，這種現象開始獲得更多關注，人們也不再僅僅把它當成一個流行詞來看待。 Image caption 「工作狂」並不是一種正式的疾病——但它絕不僅僅是一個流行詞（圖片來源：Getty Images） 美國精神病學協會的精神疾病診斷與統計手冊是診斷精神疾病的黃金法則，但工作狂卻並未被其認可為一種疾病。 然而，儘管沒有精確的定義，但工作狂對人們產生的影響卻有可能與健康、職業和心理問題存在關聯，而研究人員也在關注此事。喬治亞大學最近開展的元分析——對現有的工作狂研究文獻展開定量總結——顯示，與工作態度和工作方法更為健康的同事相比，工作狂的效率反而更低。 挪威卑爾根大學今年5月發佈的一項大型研究將工作狂傾向與其他精神病問題關聯起來，包括強迫症、焦慮症和抑鬱症。 工作成癮 如果努力工作對你產生了負面影響該怎麼辦？哪些跡象能讓人們確認自己「工作成癮」？北卡羅來納州精神治療師布萊恩·羅賓遜（Bryan Robinson）表示，工作狂是一種強烈的衝動——它令人們難以擺脫工作的意願和想法。羅賓遜曾經對工作成癮的影響展開過早期研究，還寫了一本名為《拴在辦公桌上》（Chained to the Desk）的工作狂指導手冊。 「工作狂不是根據工作時間來定義的，而是要考慮我們內心的想法。」他說。 「工作狂在滑雪時想著回去工作。而健康的人則是在工作時想著去滑雪。」 羅賓遜的客戶裏就有一些人因為長時間加班而離婚、失業或者遭遇健康問題。他回憶道，有一位客戶曾經騙自己的丈夫說她在健身房，但她實際上卻是在工作，之後再換上運動裝，用水浸透全身，讓自己看上去像是滿身是汗。 Image caption 工作衝動強的人未必能比懷有健康態度的人績效更高（圖片來源：Getty Images） 你身邊是否也有類似的人？ 但喬治亞大學的元分析顯示，與其他同事相比，工作狂的業績未必最好，在辦公室裏的活躍度也未必很高。 作為這項研究的負責人，喬治亞大學工業和組織心理學教授瑪麗莎·克拉克（Malissa A Clark）表示，工作狂的職場壓力更大，工作滿意度和生活滿意度更低，也更易疲憊。 危險信號 卑爾根工作成癮量表（Bergen Work Addiction Scale）使用7項基本標凖來判斷工作成癮的程度，每個標凖有以下5個選項：（1）從不，（2）很少，（3）有時，（4）經常，（5）總是。如果在7項標凖中至少有4項選擇「經常」或「總是」，你可能就是工作狂。 你心想如何才能多騰出一些時間來工作。 你的實際工作時間遠超最初的計劃。 你為了降低負罪感、焦慮感、無助感和抑鬱感而工作。 別人曾經建議你減少工作時間，但你卻置之不理。 如果無法工作，你會感到緊張。你因為工作而放棄業餘愛好、休閒活動和體育鍛煉。 你工作量太大，甚至連身體健康都受到了負面影響。 Image caption 由於你無法立刻戒掉工作，所以必須制定一項計劃，控制好自己與工作之間的關係（圖片來源：Getty Images） 這些人的工作與生活之間的衝突更大，身體和心理健康度更低，包括婚姻在內的家庭關係也受到了不利影響。 她補充道，儘管工作狂經常與上進心、競爭欲、有野心和高效率聯繫在一起，但實際上，「積極影響並不多。」 評估與求助 如果你認為自己可能有問題，可以通過一些方法進行自我評估。 挪威研究人員製作的卑爾根工作成癮量表可以幫助你對自己工作時的行為、感受和態度進行衡量。工作狂互戒會也會提供一份在線問卷，可以幫助你判斷自己是否需要尋求幫助。 專家表示，第一步是承認自己有問題。 羅賓遜自稱是一個處在恢復期的工作狂，他的治療手段包括正念、心理治療、改變行為和揭露根本問題。「這種情況存在一些根本原因。有的時候是自尊，有的時候是一種調節焦慮的方法。」他說。 Image caption （圖片來源：Getty Images） 61歲的鮑勃承認他存在這方面的問題。妻子告訴他，她已經受夠了現在的生活：她經常半夜醒來發現丈夫不在身邊，而是在辦公室裏加班。鮑勃是工作狂互戒會的外聯主任，這是一項志願工作。為了避免別人暴露身份，他拒絕在這篇報道中使用自己的全名 「讓工作狂上癮的『藥物』就是腎上腺素。」他說，「緊張、壓力、危機、最後期限，這都會使人興奮，讓人分泌腎上腺素，從而拼命地工作。」 鮑勃5歲時就開始工作了——幫助哥哥送報紙、回收易拉罐和玻璃瓶、修剪草坪、鏟除積雪。他後來成了一名成功的商人，但健康狀況卻每況愈下。他表示，如果不向專業人士求助，他的家庭生活就會遭到破壞。他的妻子已經受夠了這種生活。 「正是因為她受夠了這樣的生活，我才下定決心參加這個項目。」鮑勃說。 但跟吃飯一樣，工作不可能一下子就完全放棄。既然如此，又該如何控制不停工作的衝動呢？「應該制定一份計劃，然後按照計劃行事，而不是隨時強迫自己處理所有事情。」鮑勃說。這意味著要安排好工作時間，每次只能集中精力做一件事情。如果有其他事情突然出現，不能手忙腳亂地同時處理所有事情，而應該查看計劃，並重新確定優先順序。 其他的治療方案還包括尋找精通這一領域的治療師。或者，也可以參加門診研討會和門診項目。而現在還出現了一些住院治療項目，例如美國俄亥俄州的The Bridge To Recovery就計劃為工作狂提供幫助，同時輔以強迫症、焦慮症和抑鬱症等方面的其他治療。 但克拉克表示，目前的治療方案之所以匱乏，主要原因是缺乏相關研究。「關於工作狂起因的研究本身就不多，而關於工作狂與臨牀症狀相互關係的研究更是幾乎沒有。」挪威的研究算是其中之一。 她表示，現在需要進行更多的研究，「這樣才能讓這個問題變得更加主流，而不再是小眾的流行詞。這的確會對人們的生活和幸福構成明確的負面影響。」 訪問 BBC Capital 閱讀 英文原文。,{},"['caption',

"What makes a whisky cask worth £500,000?","Casks of Scotch whisky have been sold for more than £500,000. Why is interest so high in the spirit?",,31 October 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Just how much would you pay for a cask of rare Scotch whisky? For some, it seems, the sky is the limit when it comes to liquid gold. Earlier this month, an anonymous buyer in Hong Kong paid an auction-record £285,000 for a sherry cask filled with a 30-year-old Macallan single malt. Its contents, if emptied, would work out at a neat £1,000 per 70cl bottle. Others have paid even more for a cask of the hard stuff, with one Scotch whisky brokerage reporting a sale in excess of £500,000. Some industry experts believe there are £1m casks out there waiting to be found. Image copyright Spink Auctions Image caption A 30-year-old Macallan single malt sherry cask was sold recently at auction for £285,000 So why are people willing to spend such eye-watering amounts of money on the spirit? The answer isnt straightforward. For some, casks are merely an investment. For others, such as connoisseurs and collectors, theres more emphasis on the experience - tasting a spirit that has been ageing in oak casks for decades. But rarity is also highly prized. That may sound strange when an estimated three billion litres of the spirit is busy maturing in storage - enough to fill 1,200 Olympic-sized swimming pools. But in reality much of it is relatively new - bearing in mind that it requires three years of maturation before a spirit can legally take on the name Scotch. Those operating at the top end of the market - the really rare stuff - say there is no shortage of interest from potential buyers. Analyst and broker Rare Whisky 101 (RW101) has noted increased demand for ""quality casks"" from connoisseurs, collectors and investors. The Dunfermline-based firm, co-founded in 2014 by Andy Simpson and David Robertson, says its past deals with brands such as Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Macallan and Springbank have achieved an average cask price of more than £130,000. Image copyright RW101 Image caption RW101 was co-founded by Andy Simpson (left) and David Robertson Mr Simpson says buyers are drawn by ""rarity and uniqueness"". He explains: ""The vast majority of distillers will not part with aged stock as its too important for them to maintain the brand. ""If they do allow cask sales, as with Diageos Casks of Distinction programme, these are, again, exceptionally rare. ""Its also about the unique factor of cask ownership - no two casks are the same - so theyre truly unique. ""Weve tried many concurrently numbered casks, distilled on the same day, filled into (theoretically) identical casks and the samples are hugely different."" Image caption Source: Scotch Whisky Association But Mr Simpson also makes the point that while older casks can bring greater rewards - they also bring bigger risks. He explains: ""With older casks, theres a risk they drop to below 40% ABV (alcohol by volume), the legal minimum for spirit to be called Scotch. ""If that happens then the cask becomes worth a fraction of its former price. ""A couple of years ago we got excited by a 49-year-old sample coming through. On paper it should have been the oldest ever expression from the distillery of origin. ""When the sample arrived it was like Castrol GTX - thick, viscous, green gloop. And with an ABV of just 28%, it was worthless."" He adds: ""Casks do also evaporate, so the longer its left, the fewer bottles will be yielded upon bottling. ""The first rule of buying Scotch as an investment is to make sure its exemplary quality. ""One persons investment today could be - and frequently is - anothers favourite drinks cupboard dram tomorrow."" Image copyright John Paul Photography Although rare casks are highly prized by collectors, connoisseurs and investors alike, the marketplace for people with less deep pockets also appears to be thriving. One whisky specialist has been tapping into the market by appealing to investors who dont feel the need to touch, smell or even taste the product. Whisky Invest Direct launched an online trading platform for Scotch two years ago. Describing itself as a ""stock exchange for whisky"", the company allows private investors to buy and sell Scotch whiskies early in their maturation process. The firm now has 4,500 whisky accounts with more than £12m invested in 3.5 million litres of spirit. Chief executive Rupert Patrick, a former director of whisky giant Diageo, says: ""Buying maturing stocks of whisky on our platform has allowed investors to enjoy net returns of over 7% per year since we launched two years ago. ""Two of the key benefits that we offer investors are that we give them access to an un-inflated tangible asset, and our market place is very liquid - a 24/7 trading exchange."" Image copyright SCDA Image caption Strathearn Distillery founder Tony Reeman-Clark says customers ""want something that is unique"" Although the big whisky firms hold the lions share of the 20 million or so casks currently stored around Scotland, smaller craft distilleries are now eyeing what they see as a gap in the market. They include Perth-based Strathearn Distillery, which prides itself as being ""probably Scotlands smallest distillery"" with a capacity of just 10,000 litres. Founder and owner Tony Reeman-Clark argues that small is beautiful when it comes to meeting customers tastes. Something unique He says: ""We have found that people want a strong provenance, something that is unique, and there is no better way to do that than buy your own cask of whisky from a craft distillery. ""If you buy a hogshead cask, you will end up with 300 bottles and they are all the same. ""But because we are a small distillery, we generally offer casks with only 40 or 50 litres of whisky in them. ""We have had customers buying two or three of them at one go - casks with different finishes, such as sherry or brandy, so they can experience different tastes."" Mr Reeman-Clark says the firm has attracted customers from as far as Germany, Sweden and the Far East. He adds: ""People buy our casks for a wide range of reasons - for example, for their children, for investment purposes and even for weddings. ""We had a group of oil workers here recently who refilled their cask with peated spirit after finishing the first batch. ""They know they are welcome back anytime to taste the spirit so they have a good idea of what it will be like when they are ready to bottle it.""",{},"['whisky', 'makes', 'worth', '500000', 'simpson', 'distillery', 'cask', 'investors', 'rare', 'spirit', 'copyright', 'casks', 'scotch']","Image copyright Getty ImagesJust how much would you pay for a cask of rare Scotch whisky?

Twitter adventures of Abingdon taxi driver Colin,A taxi driver tweets about the strange and wonderful things that take place in his vehicle.,,21 August 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Colins tweets describe eccentric characters and dramatic night shifts How do you behave when youre in the back of a taxi? Colin drives a licensed hackney carriage and is also a private hire driver in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. In his passengers he sees the best and worst in people. Whats more, he tweets about it. ""There are no no go areas,"" he said. ""Id find a way of describing most of the situations that go on because theyre endlessly fascinating."" However, Colin remains largely anonymous to his Twitter followers. From his comments they can deduce that he is a Christian and he likes quoting Shakespeare. Colin is also 45 and hails from Oxford. His tales paint a picture of a world the rest of us only ever glimpse. It is one of ""arguing couples"", ""drunken squaddies"", and taxi conversations that cover every subject under the sun (and moon). Quite outrageous Colins Tweets: An old regular tries to draw me into a lightly homophobic conversation about ""the gays"" being allowed to marry A punter is blaspheming so excessively I have to ask him to stop doing it The passengers are in their 60s and they have started to make out in the back of the taxi A bloke is laid out on the ground next to the war memorial… gives me £20 and tells me he doesnt know what hes just given me… it is clear he is completely out of it [Taking] a nice little old lady with lucidity to the same hairdresser shes been going to for 40 years tucked away behind Cumnor Hill [I] drop the man off at Littlemore. On his return journey theres a tangible melancholy air in the car A bloke on the old probation office steps is trying to persuade a woman to go home with him. ""Im a good girl,"" is the response A mental health patient voluntarily turns themselves in to the Littlemore Hospital The next passenger feels the need to assert that he is heterosexual A woman on The Rank sat on the steps of Hodsons is having a crisis. She looks tired and emotional Bloke in red shirt lying in the road on Stratton Way crossing, kebab strewn all over the road ""The stories he tells about the people in the back of his taxi are fascinating to read"" said BBC presenter Phil Gayle, one of a growing throng of followers that includes several journalists and politicians. ""Its interesting how people carry on - their behaviour would no doubt be very different if they knew it was being tweeted."" This is most evident on Colins early morning weekend shifts. ""On Friday and Saturday nights theres this time at one oclock when the quality of the customers and their behaviour really deteriorates considerably,"" he explained. ""People by that time have consumed a fair amount of alcohol and the sensible people will have gone home during the mini-rush after the pubs close. ""During the day they are nice sensible middle-class people who once they get a drink inside them will do things that are quite outrageous. ""Lets just say no dog has ever had an accident in my taxi but humans have."" Hilarious characters Colins narrative features a whole cast of regulars, with pseudonyms to protect their identities. These eccentrics are given monikers such as Cheap as Chips Charlie, Jabber, Rather Large Dave, The Red Baron, Grumpy Sid, Grey Mercedes, Chuckle Brother, and The Professor. Grey Mercedes in particular comes across like some kind of nemesis to Colin, a seemingly bad driver with even worse manners. ""I dont use peoples real names or give out addresses or personal information"" Colin said. Image caption Colin works long hours for six days a week in Abingdon and Oxford ""Most of the time I should think people wouldnt even recognise themselves. ""Theres a much more subtle way of going about things."" Of course, as @theabingdontaxis popularity increases, so do the chances of his anonymity being shattered. Abingdon resident Nathan Allsworth, from the band Grudle Bay, has been following Colins tweets since the early days. He said: ""One day we randomly booked a taxi to a gig. We started talking to the driver about this taxi tweeter and how interesting it was to read about our hometown and the hilarious characters within. ""He then turned around and said thats me and the odds alone floored us."" But for the moment Colin retains his air of mystery. So the next time youre in a taxi you may want to think about just how your conduct would look to the rest of the world. Colin said: ""I cant stand rudeness, people who are not courteous and take for granted the situation theyre in. ""Its my living, I dont do it for fun, I do it six days a week for long hours. ""It just seems to me that the community of taxi drivers are grossly taken advantage of by whole swathes of society.""",{},"['youre', 'tweets', 'taxi', 'way', 'old', 'adventures', 'driver', 'colins', 'woman', 'twitter', 'week', 'colin', 'abingdon']","Image caption Colin's tweets describe eccentric characters and dramatic night shiftsHow do you behave when you're in the back of a taxi?

Voluntary breath tests for Selby's weekend drinkers,Drinkers in Selby town centre to be asked to take a voluntary breathalyser test during night out,,24 July 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright PA Image caption Academics from York St John University will take breath samples as part of a research project Revellers in Selby are to be asked to take a voluntary breathalyser test to measure their alcohol levels, North Yorkshire Police said. Readings would be strictly confidential and give insights including the effects of ""pre-loading"", or drinking at home before going out. Researchers from York St John University are to take the readings. Sgt Ian McNiff said the police would not arrest any participant based on the test results. It was hoped breath samples would be taken from participants at the start and the end of the night. This would help to see how much alcohol was drunk before they reached the town centre and alcohol levels after a night out. The readings would be taken by four university researchers around Finkle Street and Market Cross starting about 20:00 BST on Friday and Saturday. The police would not interfere with the sampling process, said Sgt McNiff. Selby was chosen to be representative as a small market town in the county and not because of a particular drinking problem, he added. It was hoped a ""good percentage"" of the people on a night out would be sampled and the anonymous results are to be published.

'Why you pay for other people's drinking',"In this week's Scrubbing Up, Professor Anne Ludbrook argues in this week's Scrubbing Up that it is unfair that we all pay for the price for the damage caused by alcohol.",,31 December 2010,BBC News,"Image caption Putting prices up would curb intake As preparations for New Years Eve celebrations near their climax, economist Professor Anne Ludbrook argues in this weeks Scrubbing Up that it is unfair that we all pay for the price for the damage caused by alcohol. Ask yourself how you would feel if you contributed to a kitty for drinks but you didnt get a drink. Or if another customer at the supermarket asked you to pay for part of the alcohol they were buying. Sounds a bit far-fetched? But this is the reality of the peculiar market for alcohol. Everyone pays the price for alcohol, whether they drink themselves or not. Alcohol related harms cost the country over £25bn (or around £500 per adult) in costs to the NHS, police and fire services, industry, the lost value of reduced health and so forth. Supermarkets run ""loss leaders"" on alcohol to attract customers and make money from other items in the shopping basket - so you and I may be paying more for our grocery shopping to subsidise cheap alcohol. Social cost As an economist, I naturally think that markets could provide the best outcomes but only if they work properly. Trying to tackle the harms that alcohol causes without making alcohol less affordable is a bit like trying to empty a bath while the taps are still on Your comments That means that people who buy and consume alcohol should pay the true cost - the price of the drink and cost of future harms. Isnt that what alcohol duty is supposed to do? Well, duty does raise revenue but at current levels, only about a third of the amount needed. There is also the problem that duty rates in the UK are not related to alcohol content, ranging from less than 5p per unit of alcohol for cider to over 20p per unit for spirits. Even the duty on spirits is less than half the social cost per unit of alcohol. Minimum pricing establishes a floor price for alcohol and could be used to make sure that no drinks are sold below the average social cost. It would also be effective in reducing alcohol consumption and related harms. No silver bullet Research from Sweden shows that price increases targeted at the lowest cost brands would produce almost 2.5 times the reduction in alcohol consumption that an across the board price rise would. Also, the heaviest drinkers reduce their drinking most because they tend to drink the cheaper products. Image caption Supermarkets regularly offer cut-price deals on alcohol Research by the University of Sheffield for the Department of Health and the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) shows that a minimum price of 50p per unit of alcohol would reduce alcohol consumption by 6.7% percent on average but the heaviest drinkers would reduce consumption by 10.1%. The value of the reduced harm from alcohol would be nearly £1bn in the first year: 80% would come from the reduction in consumption by harmful drinkers. Minimum pricing has recently failed to gain sufficient support in the Scottish Parliament to see it pass into legislation. However, it has been recommended for consideration by NICE and by the House of Commons Health Select Committee. The UK governments alternative proposal is to ban below-cost selling but this can be hard to define. If it is interpreted as duty plus VAT, then the impact on average consumption may be negligible unless duty rates are both reformed and increased. Successive governments have said they want to tackle alcohol-related harms but have pursued policies that have been ineffective. Minimum pricing of alcohol is effective and well targeted but it is not a silver bullet. A range of policies needs to be put in place - but trying to tackle the harms that alcohol causes without making alcohol less affordable is a bit like trying to empty a bath while the taps are still on.",{},"['trying', 'price', 'harms', 'consumption', 'cost', 'pay', 'tackle', 'health', 'alcohol', 'peoples', 'drinking', 'unit', 'duty']","Or if another customer at the supermarket asked you to pay for part of the alcohol they were buying.

Bạn có phải là người nghiện công việc?,Có sự khác biệt giữa người làm việc nhiều và người bị cuốn vào việc ngoài tầm kiểm soát?,,9 tháng 11 2016,BBC News Tiếng Việt,"Bản quyền hình ảnh Getty Images Image caption Nghiện việc không phải là một chứng rối loạn chính thức, nó chỉ hơn một thuật ngữ khá thông thường Có sự khác biệt giữa người làm việc nhiều và người bị cuốn vào việc ngoài tầm kiểm soát. Ranh giới nằm ở chỗ nào? Ai cũng thích người làm việc tích cực. Thực tế, làm việc nhiều và kiếm được nhiều tiền là điều nhiều người coi là dấu hiệu của sự thành công. Trong khi bị gọi là nghiện việc thường bị xem là không được hay ho lắm. Nhưng với một số người thì nhu cầu ám ảnh về công việc phải trả giá bằng mọi thứ khác, đó là sức khỏe, quan hệ và thậm chí cả chất lượng công việc. Đó là giá rất đắt. Cho dù thế nào thì sự thúc bách làm việc đã dẫn đến việc người ta phải điều trị và tham gia các nhóm tự hỗ trợ trong nhiều năm. Thậm chí nghiện việc có thể gây tử vong. Đầu tháng này, một nghiên cứu của chính phủ Nhật cho hay 1/5 lực lượng lao động Nhật có nguy cơ tử vong vì làm việc quá sức. Làm việc quá tải không chỉ là vấn đề nan giải ở Nhật Bản. Chương trình 12 bước Workaholics Anonymous phỏng theo chương trình Alcoholics Anonymous, đã tổ chức hội nghị quốc tế đầu tiên ở Anh trong tháng 6, với những người tham dự từ khắp thế giới. Bản quyền hình ảnh Getty Images Image caption Ai cũng thích người làm việc tích cực? Cho tới nay, có ít nghiên cứu về nguyên nhân gây ra nghiện việc. Nhưng những năm gần đây đã có thay đổi, hiện tượng nghiện việc được chú ý hơn và đang được xử lý, chứ không chỉ được coi là một từ thông dụng. Nghiện việc hiện không được công nhận là một bệnh y học theo Cẩm Nang Chẩn Đoán Và Thống Kê Của Hội Bác Sĩ Tâm Thần (là tiêu chuẩn chuẩn mực để chẩn đoán bệnh tâm thần). Nhưng ngay cả khi không có định nghĩa chính xác thì tác động của nó có liên quan đến sức khỏe, nơi làm việc và những vấn đề tinh thần, và các nhà nghiên cứu ghi nhận là có. Một nghiên cứu toàn diện mới đây, mang tính định lượng, của Đại học Georgia cho thấy, ngoài những vấn đề khác, những người nghiện việc có năng suất kém các đồng nghiệp có quan điểm lành mạnh hơn trong công việc. Một nghiên cứu khác lớn hơn được xuất bản vào tháng Năm của trường Đại học Bergen ở Na Uy, đã chứng minh mối quan hệ giữa nghiện việc với các vấn đề tâm lý khác, như chứng rối loạn cưỡng bức ám ảnh, lo lắng và trầm cảm. Không phải là công việc tốt nhất Nhưng khi nào thì làm việc vất vả trở thành tiêu cực? Điều gì có thể làm ai đó tin là mình bị nghiện việc? Nghiện việc là một sự cưỡng bách, một sự thôi thúc ngoài tầm kiểm soát và ám ảnh phải làm việc hoặc phải nghĩ về làm việc, Bryan Robinson, một bác sỹ điều trị tâm thần ở Bắc Carolina và đã thực hiện nghiên cứu tác động của nghiện việc, tác giả cuốn cẩm nang Bị Khóa Vào Bàn Làm Việc, nói. Biểu hiện nghiện việc Thang đo mức nghiện việc Bergen sử dụng 7 tiêu chí chính, điểm cho như sau: (1) Không bao giờ, (2) Hiếm khi, (3) Đôi khi, (4) Thường xuyên, và (5) Luôn luôn. Nếu bạn có điểm ""Thường xuyên"" hoặc ""Luôn luôn"" ít nhất là 4 trong 7 tiêu chí thì có thể là bạn bị nghiện việc. • Bạn nghĩ cách để có thể có được nhiều thời gian hơn cho công việc. • Bạn bỏ nhiều thời gian làm việc hơn hơn dự kiến ban đầu. • Bạn làm việc để giảm cảm giác mình có lỗi, lo lắng, không được giúp đỡ và suy nhược. • Bạn không nghe khi bạn bè bảo bạn làm việc ít đi. • Bạn thấy căng thẳng nếu bạn bị cấm làm việc. • Bạn bỏ ưu tiên cho các thú riêng, các hoạt động khi nhàn rỗi và thể dục vì bận việc. • Bạn làm việc nhiều đến mức sức khỏe bị ảnh hưởng xấu. ""Nghiện việc không tính bằng giờ. Nó được xác định bằng điều đã xảy ra bên trong chúng ta,"" ông nói. ""Một người nghiện việc là một người trong khi đang trượt tuyết thì mơ quay trở về để làm việc. Một người làm việc lành mạnh là người khi đang làm thì mơ đi trượt tuyết."" Robinson (là người đưa lời khuyên cho những người đã ly dị, bị thôi việc hoặc bị khủng hoảng sức khỏe do làm việc quá mức) nhớ lại một khách hàng nói rằng bà nói với chồng rằng mình đã đi tập ở phòng gym, nhưng thực tế là bà đi làm, trước đó bà đã mặc quần áo thể thao và làm cho ướt người để trông giống như toát mồ hôi. Có giống như ai đó mà bạn biết không? Nhưng những người nghiện việc không tất yếu tạo ra kết quả tốt nhất hoặc gắn bó hơn ở cơ quan so với đồng nghiệp, sự phân tích toàn diện của trường Đại học Georgia phát hiện như vậy. Malissa A Clark, một giáo sư trợ giảng về tâm lý của Đại học Georgia, chỉ đạo nghiên cứu này. Bà nói những người nghiện việc bị căng thẳng hơn và kém hài lòng hơn trong công việc, kém hài lòng hơn trong cuộc sống và bỏ nhiều công sức hơn. Họ cũng bị xung đột lớn hơn trong quan hệ công việc và cuộc sống, sức khỏe thể lực và tinh thần kém hơn và dẫn đến kết cục bất lợi cho gia đình, như rắc rối trong hôn nhân. ""Ít có những kết cục tốt,"" bà nói, mặc dù quan niệm của nghiện việc thường liên quan với những đặc điểm như gắn bó với việc, cạnh tranh, ham muốn và có năng suất tốt. Bạn có nghĩ rằng bạn có vấn đề không? Có một số tiêu chí tự đánh giá để thử. Các nhà nghiên cứu Na Uy có thiết lập thang đo mức nghiện việc Bergen để bạn đo cách hành xử, cảm giác và thái độ của bạn đối với công việc. Chương trình Workaholics Anonymous cũng có các câu hỏi trên mạng giúp bạn xác định nếu bạn cần. Bước đầu tiên, chuyên gia nói, là cứ thừa nhận rằng bạn có vấn đề. Bản quyền hình ảnh Getty Images Image caption Vì bạn không thể từ bỏ nó một cách đột ngột, bạn phải có kế hoạch giải quyết cách thức làm việc của mình Đối với Robinson (tự cho mình là người mới khỏi nghiện việc) thì việc điều trị gồm sự quan tâm, điều trị, thay đổi cách cư xử và bộc lộ các vấn đề nằm dưới. ""Nó có những nguyên nhân sâu xa. Đôi khi đó là thể diện, đôi khi đó là một cách để điều chỉnh mối lo lắng,"" ông nói. Đối với Bob, 61 tuổi, ở California, ông đã thừa nhận là có vấn đề khi vợ ông nói với ông là bà không chịu nổi khi nửa đêm thức giấc và thấy ông không ở nhà, vẫn còn ở cơ quan. Bob (người không nêu tên họ để đảm bảo việc ẩn danh của chương trình Workaholics Anonymous) hiện là nhân viên biệt phái cho chương trình này, làm tự nguyện. ""Thuốc cho người nghiện việc là adrenaline,"" ông nói. ""Sự căng thẳng, áp lực, khủng hoảng, hạn phải xong việc, tất cả những thứ này cho phép năng lực có thêm adrenaline để hoạt động với nhịp độ điên cuồng."" Bob có công việc đầu tiên khi 5 tuổi, đó là giúp anh đưa báo, tái chế lon đồ uống và chai lọ, cắt cỏ và xúc tuyết. Ông đã trở thành một doanh nhân thành công, nhưng cuối cùng thì sức khỏe giảm sút, và nếu ông không tìm sự hỗ trợ thì cuộc sống gia đình cũng sẽ tồi tệ, ông nói. Vợ ông đã không chịu đựng nổi.

Serial killer trial priest 'raped schoolgirl 40 times',An alleged victim of the late Father Gerry Nugent claims she was targeted over a two-year period.,,15 June 2018,BBC News,"Image caption Father Gerry Nugent was the priest at the church where Angelika Kluks body was found A disgraced Roman Catholic priest has been accused of raping a schoolgirl up to 40 times over a two-year period. Father Gerry Nugent was shamed in 2007 when he admitted to a murder trial he had sex with student Angelika Kluk, a victim of serial killer Peter Tobin. Police Scotland have now confirmed they are investigating historical allegations of child sexual abuse against the priest, who died in 2010. The Catholic Church said it was ""truly sorry"" for what happened decades ago. The church said it now had a ""dramatically different awareness of child protection issues"". It said Fr Nugent was ""removed from parish ministry"" as soon as the extent of his inappropriate sexual behaviour with adults became apparent in 2007 and that ""allegations relating to minors only emerged after his removal"". Image caption Angelika Kluk was murdered in September 2006 The BBC has spoken to a 51-year-old woman, who we are calling Teresa, who said that Fr Nugent raped her repeatedly when she was 13. She is seeking damages from the Catholic Church. Teresa said Fr Nugent had been close to her grandmother, with whom she lived in the west end of Glasgow. She said: ""He was a very dear friend to gran and because I loved her so much and I could see their relationship made her happy I always felt happy, confident, comfortable in his presence."" But she went on to describe a sinister pattern of behaviour by Fr Nugent which progressed from holding her hand to stroking her. Teresa added: ""Eventually, around the time of my 13th birthday, he raped me and continued to do so for two years on a regular basis. ""I loved him very much so I thought that this behaviour was normal in families because that is what he told me."" Teresa claimed Fr Nugent, who was often under the influence of alcohol, first raped her in the flat where she lived with her grandmother. She also claimed he would sexually assault her in the stairwell of the building. Teresa said: ""It happened in an motorway underpass on a couple of occasions and quite often it would happen when we were just walking down the street. ""He never seemed at all concerned that a priest would be a walking down the road while having his hand on the bottom of an obviously very young girl."" Image caption Fr Nugent was a priest at St Patricks Church in Anderston, Glasgow Asked how many times it happened, Teresa replied: ""Actual rape? ""I think somewhere in the region of 30 and 40 times in total."" The mother-of-four claims the abuse stopped when she was 15 after her grandmother died from a massive brain haemorrhage. Around this time she discovered she was not Fr Nugents only alleged victim. After Teresa confided in a friend, she told her: ""I know. This is what he has been doing to me."" These allegations are also being investigated by Police Scotland. Both women are being represented by Thompsons Solicitors. A Glasgow law firm is also thought to be speaking to a third victim. Public apology Teresa has suffered anxiety and depression throughout her adult life and has undergone therapy. Her relationship with her husband also broke down. She said: ""There hasnt been a single aspect of my life that it hasnt affected and I havent always been conscious of that."" In 2015 she approached the Catholic Church about her experiences. Theresa said she met safeguarding staff at the Archdiocese of Glasgow and Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, whom she thanked for his public apology. But she claimed ""the shutters came down"" after she threatened legal action. Theresa believes there are more alleged victims of Fr Nugent and urged them to come forward. She added: ""These acts are historical but the effects are not historical. ""They are affecting people every single day."" Image caption Peter Tobin, the man who murdered Angelika Kluk, was later unmasked as a serial killer Fr Nugent hit the headlines in September 2006 after the mutilated body of 23-year-old Angelika Kluk was found under the floorboards of St Patricks Church in the Anderston area of Glasgow. Serial killer Peter Tobin had been working there as a church handyman, under an assumed name. Tobin was eventually convicted of the murder, but during the trial Fr Nugent admitted he was in a sexual relationship with Angelika. The Dublin-born priest, who was forced to resign from his post, said he felt ""shame"" and ""disgust"" with himself and admitted he had abused the position of trust he was in. The self-confessed alcoholic was also found guilty of contempt of court because he did not give straight answers in the witness box during the trial. At the time, the Catholic Church issued an apology over the priests behaviour. He died in January 2010, aged 66, after a suspected heart attack. Sincere and heartfelt Last year a long-standing time bar which prevented victims of childhood abuse seeking civil legal action was lifted. The Catholic Church confirmed it is aware of complaints against Fr Nugent dating back to the 1970s. A church spokesman said: ""Allegations have been made by women that they were sexually assaulted by the late Fr Gerry Nugent when they were children, some around 40 years ago. ""The crimes described in these allegations are appalling. ""The Church, its bishops, priests and people are truly sorry for what has happened. ""The Archbishop has met the survivor interviewed by the BBC and apologised in person and on behalf of the Church for what she has gone through. ""That apology is sincere and heartfelt and is extended to anyone who suffered at the hands of Fr Nugent or any other representative of the Church."" Appeal for victims The church confirmed no allegations of child abuse until after Fr Nugent was removed from his ministry. In 1995 he was sent for ""psychological assessment"" and therapy following an anonymous allegation he engaged in ""inappropriate sexual conduct with an adult"". But the spokesman added: ""The assessment did not flag any issues with his sexual conduct, but highlighted alcohol abuse as a cause for concern. ""It may be that no-one will ever know the full truth of all Fr Nugents wrongful conduct and criminal actions, but the Church remains ready and willing to co-operate with the police and statutory authorities to assist survivors. ""The Church offers ongoing counselling to those affected and will also co-operate fully should they engage legal representation to seek financial recompense."" Teresas lawyer Alan Rodgers said: ""What we really want to do is take her case forward and give other people the inspiration and courage to come forward if they have been through similar experiences so that we can also try to obtain answers for them.""

Rooney family slavery victim 'made to dig own grave',Eighteen people were illegally trafficked and exploited to fund the Rooney family's lavish lifestyle.,,12 September 2017,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The sister of one of the victims says he was forced to dig his own grave Members of a traveller family have been jailed for enslaving 18 men who were made to work for little or no wages while their captors lived a life of lavish luxury. The workers were illegally trafficked and exploited by the Rooney family - 10 men and one woman - whose actions left a gruelling mark on their victims. One mans terrifying ordeal spanned more than a quarter of a century. On one occasion, he was made to dig his own grave if he did not agree to a lifetime of servitude. ""Youre going to work for me for the rest of your life... if you dont sign this contract that is where youre going,"" John Rooney told his victim, pointing at the hole he had been forced to dig. The harrowing details have been told to the BBC by the victims sister. Image copyright Lincolnshire Police Image caption Police said the living quarters of 18 men who were trafficked into a modern slavery ring were ""truly shocking"" She described how her brother was beaten with a rake and had his front teeth smashed with a concrete slab in savage attacks which left him ""psychologically damaged"". ""I think one of the worst stories he told me was about digging his own grave,"" his sister, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the BBC. ""John Rooney had asked him to dig a hole and he said, I kept digging and digging and digging. I said to John: Crikey how much more have I got to dig? And he said keep digging. ""According to my brother, John produced a contract and said to him youre going to work for me for the rest of your life... if you dont sign this contract that is where youre going. ""On another occasion, he was late getting up and John came into his van with a rake and hit him over the head. You can see evidence of scarring on the left side of his head. ""Its harrowing."" Image copyright Lincolnshire Police Image caption Animal faeces were found inside the workers squalid accommodation The victims were aged between 18 and 63, held in squalor and forced to work up to 12-hour days, seven days a week, for the familys tarmacking company. While the Rooneys led an extravagant lifestyle, their slaves lived in filth - some in stables next to dog kennels, many in unkempt caravans without running water or toilet facilities. ""Many were very, very thin and they were absolutely filthy,"" said Ch Supt Nikki Mayo, of Lincolnshire Police. ""These individuals didnt have a toilet so many had to go into the woods and, in fact, some were kept in a stable block nearby with animals. So, absolutely disgraceful."" Image copyright Lincolnshire Police Image caption The 11 members of the Rooney led extravagant lifestyles while their victims suffered Many were alcoholics and estranged from their relatives, while several had learning disabilities and mental health issues. Half were British nationals targeted from all over the country because they were homeless. Ch Supt Mayo said the victims were left ""completely institutionalised and isolated from society"". ""They were given scraps of food that were mainly leftovers from family meals, complete with bite marks, but only after working long hard hours tarmacking driveways and fitting block paving,"" she said. ""When they werent working for the company the men had to collect scrap, sweep, tidy up or look after pets around the sites. ""Often their only payment was a packet of tobacco and a limited amount of alcohol, which didnt help those with addictions and was another way in which the defendants exerted control over them."" Image copyright Lincolnshire Police Image caption The men worked long hard hours for little more than a packet of tobacco Even though the victims were ""not physically trapped"", they were ""financially, emotionally and physically abused making any escape seem impossible"", the detective added. The threat of violence also made them too scared to leave. One victim told police he was afraid of the Rooney gang because he had seen the brutality they had inflicted on others. ""There was one moment one of the [Rooneys] took a shovel... and then I [saw] three people kicking [the slave] as he was lying on the ground,"" he said. ""Ive been quite scared because Ive seen what theyre capable of."" The family operated from a number of sites in Lincolnshire and were caught as part of Operation Pottery, which detectives described as ""one of the largest and most complex"" cases in the forces history. Reverend Jeremy Cullimore, who worked in a homeless shelter in Lincoln, said he had tried to protect potential victims. ""We were aware that the Rooneys [had] a series of vans driving around the streets, seeking out people, to persuade them that they could offer them a nice caravan and so on. ""We introduced a number of systems so that people who were vulnerable would not be alone."" Image copyright Lincolnshire Police Image caption The defendants led a lavish lifestyle and operated from a number of sites He recalled the moment he came head-to-head with the gang. ""The family [came] to recover a man who escaped from them and they were saying quite clearly hes ours, he owes us money and we want him. ""I turned around and said You know Im a priest and I can absolve you from your sins, but beware I can bind them to you forever. Now think on this and they left. ""It was a challenge."" When police officers dismantled the ring in 2014, the force set up a refuge for the victims aided by the NHS, social services, British Red Cross and the UK Human Trafficking Centre. One charity worker, who wanted to remain anonymous, said one individual used ""an entire bottle of shampoo to make themselves feel clean"". ""When I first saw them they looked completely bedraggled. One of them asked how long he could shower for. We said as long as you like and he was completely taken aback by the response. ""After 20 minutes he came out looking like a different person. The colour in his skin came back. He just felt like a normal human being."" The scale of Operation Pottery 4,200 exhibits of evidence 2,000 lines of inquiry pursued 1,830 statements were taken from 939 people 49 hours of suspect interviews recorded Lincolnshire Police But how did the Rooney slavery ring operate undetected for so long? Kevin Hyland, the UKs Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, said there was a lack of awareness about slavery legislation and recognising the signs. ""People in the communities havent recognised this for what it is or havent really understood what it is,"" he said. ""But this case really does demonstrate how serious this crime is and it can be happening on your own front drive. ""There has been a lack of understanding and awareness but, then also, what do you do when you recognise it? The authorities themselves need to understand this and realise this is a crime and they have a duty to respond."" Under the Modern Slavery Act, introduced in 2015, it is illegal to hold someone in slavery or servitude and force them to carry out compulsory labour. For the woman whose brother was captive for 26 years, the mark left by his experience is indelible. On seeing him for the first time after his release, she said she wanted to ""fall on my knees and sob"". ""He was very thin. His teeth are terrible, theyre all rotten and hes not got many left.

Fears over 'harmful' fake alcohol on sale across the UK,There's a warning that fake alcohol containing harmful ingredients is being sold in the UK.,,None,,"Theres a warning that fake alcohol containing harmful ingredients is being sold in the UK. The Trading Standards Institute (TSI) says people should take extra care when buying alcohol over Christmas. Officials say they are extremely concerned about the number of fake bottles being found on sale in off-licences across the UK. In several areas thousands of litres of illegal alcohol have been recovered in the last few months. Symptoms of alcohol poisoning Confusion Loss of co-ordination Vomiting Irregular or slow breathing Blue-tinged or pale skin Low body temperature (hypothermia) Stupor (being conscious but unresponsive) Unconsciousness (passing out) Often the bottles contain chemicals used in cleaning products and experts fear drinking them could be lethal. More than 2,000 counterfeit bottles were seized during one week of raids across central parts of England in November. Similar figures have been reported following raids in other areas. The TSI says its difficult to work out the scale of the problem, but its chief executive Ron Gainsford says the situation is getting worse. ""We are very concerned about this trend in the availability of fake alcohol,"" he said. ""It is not just about false bargains; counterfeit spirits and wine could be lethal."" The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says its worried people are risking their health by trying to save money. In some cases its thought fake bottles of vodka cost as little as £6. Harmful chemicals Amy Baskerville is a student from Bristol. Last month she bought what she thought was a cheaper brand of vodka. ""My partner had drunk half of the bottle when he noticed that he wasnt getting drunk,"" she said. ""We had a sniff and normally vodka has a kick of alcohol but this just smelt like nail varnish remover."" Our bottle of vodka had chloroform, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in it Amy Baskerville Student The 22-year-old says they both felt ill the next day, so contacted Trading Standards, who carried out tests. ""We were told that our bottle had chloroform, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in it. ""It was a couple of pounds cheaper than more well-branded vodkas. Its surprising how you go for the cheapest thing on the shelf."" Some of those chemicals are also found in cleaning products. Earlier this year five men were killed in an explosion at a garage in Boston in Lincolnshire. They had been making illegal vodka. Health experts from the county say theyre worried about the number of people coming into A&E thinking theyve had their drink spiked, but actually they have been poisoned by fake alcohol. Dr Vikas Sodiwala is a consultant in emergency medicine at Lincoln County hospital. ""We are seeing many more cases of patients coming in having said that their drinks have been spiked and I do think we are seeing an increase in awareness of the illicit alcohol thats out there,"" he said. ""The worst thing is if you drink too much of this stuff, you can get kidney failure, you can get liver failure. With methanol, particularly, it can lead to permanent blindness."" Have your say on Newsbeats Facebook page Pete Evans - When I was 15 we had a crate of fake booze off a man in our pub. It never made us ill though. Benji Mclean - We used to buy this fake whiskey, but it gave me a knee problem, felt like an arrow had been jabbed into my knee :( so I stopped buying it. Andy Jeanes - I got offered some home made vodka in Russia once, but before I got to try it someone spilt theirs and it turned a red floor tile white and melted it. I politely declined.

I like most small shop retailers, would not even consider stocking it. Anonymous - I bought a bottle of wine a few months ago from a corner shop. When I poured it out and took a sip I knew immediately it was not wine. It was very yellow and tasted strange with notes of acetone and anti-freeze. Not what I usually look for in a wine! Sean, Southampton - Ive had fake vodka before. I had horrible, crippling stomach pains and felt ill for days. Never bought the cheap stuff since.

Ex-England goalkeeper Peter Shilton admits drink-drive charge,Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton is banned for 20 months after admitting drinking and driving in Essex.,,19 March 2013,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Peter Shilton: ""I had a very fair hearing"" Englands most capped footballer Peter Shilton has been banned from driving for 20 months after pleading guilty to a drink-driving offence. The 63-year-old, of Kenilworth in Warwickshire, was arrested in Manor Road in Colchester on 24 February. Shilton, whose partner is understood to live in Colchester, was charged with driving with excess alcohol. Magistrates in Colchester also ordered him to pay fines and costs totalling £1,020.

He played 125 times for England, including every match at three consecutive World Cups - in 1982, 1986 and 1990. Deep regret The 15-minute court hearing was told Shilton had more than double the legal amount of alcohol in his system when he was breathalysed by police. He had been drinking wine at a family celebration during the day but did not think he was over the limit, the court heard. He was driving a 2010-registered Jaguar XF near the home of his girlfriend, Stephanie Hayward, and was caught after an anonymous tip-off to police.

Why people are picking London for their retirement,"London's transport, cultural scene and its sheer size are proving a big draw for people in retirement, BBC Inside Out reports.",,15 September 2014,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Inside Out discovers why London is the best place to retire to London is often thought of as a young persons city, but - despite what many might think - some pensioners now regard it as a ""retirement nirvana"". A survey by strategic advice firm BritainThinks has found that the capital appeals to pensioners because of its excellent transport links, its vibrant cultural scene and even the opportunity to become anonymous in a sprawling city, BBC Inside Out reports. But not everything falls in Londons favour. The capital is often derided because of its high cost of living, excessive noise, air pollution and the fear of crime. And a report by pensions company Prudential ranking the best places to retire in Britain, placed eight London boroughs in the bottom 20 of 174 locations analysed. While Dorset was ranked top, Londons Tower Hamlets came fifth from bottom. Not for the young? Image caption Despite stereotypes, the capital can be much more appealing to pensioners than the young Deborah Mattinson, director for BritainThinks, said London might not be the best place for young people due to its high cost of living. However, for pensioners the city offers the chance to be yourself, because ""however different you are, London will embrace you"". ""Older people can afford London - often theyve got property which means that they dont have to worry about where they live,"" she added. ""They like the atmosphere, they like its diversity, they like what it has to offer culturally - they like everything about it."" ""People think of London as a young city, but one of the things we found - and theres an irony here - is that the people that London works best for is actually not young people at all. ""We found increasingly that we had a group of unhappy young people living in London, none of them can afford anywhere to live - theyre all looking for jobs.

A keen fisherman, he would have been a prime candidate for moving to a cottage by a stream or a bungalow near the sea, but he relishes Londons rich mix of sights and sounds along with its accessibility. ""The transport system is absolutely fantastic, youve only got to wait two or three minutes and a bus comes along,"" he said. ""If you live in a London borough you get a £10 card and you go anywhere - Underground, national rail, Overground - you can go all over. ""Ive lived here all my life and Ive seen places I didnt know existed. ""I go up to the Old Bailey, sit in on a case there - theres so much here, Im up and down most days of the week. Its pure theatre."" Getting lost Image caption Mark Breese values the anonymity that a large city like London can bring Mark Breese moved to the capital and values being unknown in its sprawl - something he has found impossible living in a smaller environment. ""Im a person in long term recovery - my particular addiction is alcohol and I have been sober for 27 years,"" he said. ""Since I retired I have thrown myself into doing volunteer work for people who suffer from addiction issues. ""Theres 600 people or so in the village [where I used to live] and I sneeze and everybody knows. If anybody else sneezes I know about it, and thats lovely - theres a sense of community. ""But the big city and its anonymity, where everybody doesnt know their own neighbours, I think creates a freedom for people who might meet disapproval, more from a lack of education and understanding."" Keeping lively Image caption Mark Bostock says the need to walk in London helps keep older people active Mark Bostock and his wife bought a flat in Barbican and enjoy the need to walk through Londons streets, which keeps them active in their later years. ""Where we are in the Barbican, if you put a line round a 40 minute walk you can cover most places that you want to go,"" he said. ""As one gets older, ones brain needs a good stimulus in order to avoid some of these rather nasty conditions that one seems to get in old age, and I think living in the country, no matter how attractive it is, one doesnt get that level of stimulation. ""One tends to walk much more extensively in London - you go up and down escalators if youre using London Underground, in the country one is very much more car-borne, and I think if your active in this way this is good for your health.""

Truckers driving on Class A drugs to 'relieve boredom',"A drug-driving culture is common among some drivers working in the UK road haulage business who use Class A's to stay awake, say industry insiders.",,1 April 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Tests carried out by drug testing firms for hauliers suggest around 1 in 10 drivers take drugs A culture of Class A drug taking is common among some drivers working in the UK road haulage business, say industry insiders. Truck drivers are resorting to cocaine, speed and ecstasy to help keep themselves awake on long journeys. Drug testing firms say to have 10% of drivers in an haulage firm test positive for drugs was ""not unusual"". Road safety minister Mike Penning insists Britains roads are among the safest in the world. One lorry driver speaking to the BBCs5 live Investigatesprogramme, who works for a major international haulage company, claims he regularly sees drivers use ecstasy, cannabis, speed and cocaine to relieve the boredom of lengthy shifts. The highly experienced driver has tried to raise the issue with managers at his firm but says nobody wants to take responsibility and tries to pass the buck to another department. They are basically taking a recreational drug like ecstasy and speed to keep themselves awake because of the distances involved and because boredom just kicks in Anonymous HGV driver One in 10 testing positive The driver, who spoke anonymously, says fellow drivers have in the past veered off motorways or overturned, and in some instances were not even able to remember the incident afterwards. In one incident the insider was told about, a heavily drugged-up driver ploughed into workmens vehicles by the side of a motorway. When questioned by the police the driver was only tested for alcohol and he was not arrested. ""They are basically taking a recreational drug like ecstasy and speed to keep themselves awake because of the distances involved and because boredom just kicks in,"" said the driver. He explained that drivers got around rules governing how many hours they were allowed to work by taking two tachograph cards, which record driver hours, speed and distance. To make it look like two drivers were operating a vehicle, when it was in fact one, drivers simply swapped the cards around at the end of a shift. The drivers testimony is backed-up by a number of drug testing companies contacted by 5 live Investigates. The companies did not want to be identified for fear of losing business but revealed they knew about a substantial number of positive readings among truck and van drivers. One firm carrying out tests for a major haulage company for the first time found 10% of drivers tested positive for illegal drugs, but said none of them lost their jobs. Told of 5 lives findings, another drug testing firm said in its experience 10% of drivers testing positive for illegal drugs in the transport industry was ""not outrageous or surprising"". That was backed up by a third testing firm which revealed a company that employs around 5,000 courier drivers, found around 10% of its drivers tested positive for illegal drugs. Another insider who assesses risk for major companies told the BBC how one firm tested 300 young van drivers in their 20s, and more than 40 of them tested positive for illegal drugs. Industry has concerns In evidence submitted to the Commons Transport Select Committee the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the vast majority of its members do not test drivers for drugs as they do no believe drug use among drivers to be a significant problem. Image caption Louise Cooper was 23 when she was killed by a lorry driver Of those companies which do carry out drug tests the RHA said they reported no significant problem. However, the RHA admitted that a substantial minority of its members who do not currently test drivers suspect there is a significant problem within the industry. The anonymous driver speaking to 5 live said: ""Its nothing unusual to see drivers rolling joints while theyre driving along the motorway and theyre holding the steering wheel in their knees. ""Thats why theyre driving at 50 miles per hour. Thats not a strong drug but it still shouldnt be taken while driving. ""But for the longer journey - eight or nine hours - theyre taking ecstasy. ""I was talking to a lad two weeks ago and, literally 10 minutes before, had taken ecstasy to try and keep awake and get back up because he had another seven hours in front of him. ""He said he hadnt been to sleep for two days."" We are not complacent and I am determined to crack down on those who continue to put lives at risk by drug driving Mike Penning, Road Safety Minister Campaigners are now calling for a change to the law to bring the road transport industry in line with the railway industry where there is a statutory duty to ensure drivers are drug-free. They also want haulage companies to take more responsibility for their drivers actions. Julie Williss 23-year-old daughter Louise Cooper was killed by lorry driver Lee Baker in 2008 - he admitted smoking cannabis the previous afternoon and was driving at 60mph in fog when he crashed into Miss Cooper at the roadside. Traces of cannabis were found in Mr Bakers lorry. Mrs Willis says employers should have a statutory duty to check the competency of their drivers. The toxicology report on Mr Baker, seen by 5 Live Investigates, shows cannabis was found in a blood sample. However, because of a delay in blood sampling the toxicologist was unable to say whether or not he was under the influence at the time of the incident. He was jailed for 14 months after admitting one count of death by dangerous driving because it was not known whether or not the cannabis played any part in the accident. Mrs Willis said she is angry that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did not feel it was in the public interest to pursue the drugs matter. Drug driving clampdown In a statement, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the East of England Ken Caley said: ""The most senior lawyers in CPS East of England, including myself, were involved in the decision. ""We thoroughly considered the material arising from the police investigation and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Mr Baker was under the influence of drugs when the incident which lead to the tragic death of Louise Cooper took place. ""We continue to offer our sincere condolences to Mrs Willis and her family for their tragic loss"". Mrs Willis told the BBC: ""The crux of the matter is that drug testing must take place within six hours of the accident and the drivers impairment must be proven, unlike in the case of alcohol."" ""The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (Vosa) ensure vehicles have to be kept in tip-top condition but if the driver is under the influence of drink and/or drugs, the condition of the vehicle is irrelevant."" Road Safety Minister Mike Penning insisted Britains roads were among the safest in the world. ""Drug driving is a menace, which is why we are going to introduce a new drug driving offence and approve screening equipment to make it easier for the police to test for the presence of drugs in drivers and tackle this irresponsible minority,"" he told BBC 5 live. ""We are currently putting together a panel of experts to advise us on the technical aspects of introducing a new offence of driving with an illegal drug in your body and expect them to meet in the next few weeks to finalise their terms of reference.

Why do the majority of NHS staff not get the flu vaccine?,Less than half of healthcare workers in Scotland are taking up the offer of a flu jab. Why?,,11 January 2018,BBC News,"Image copyright PA Image caption Less than half of NHS staff take up the flu jab offer All NHS staff in Scotland are offered a flu vaccination but less than half have had it. Why? The number of people going to see the doctor with influenza-like illness is higher than any year since 2010-11 but the rate is still considered ""moderate"" by health experts. In order to halt the spread of the virus, the government recommends that people who qualify for the vaccination take it up. Those eligible include young children, people over 65, pregnant women and those working in the health service. Of these groups, it seems that NHS workers have the lowest rate of take-up, with just over 40% of staff - including those who have contact with patients and those who dont - having had the jab. Flu vaccination rates Earlier this week, Sir Bruce Keogh, national medical director of NHS England, called for a ""serious debate"" over whether NHS staff should be forced to have the vaccination. He said thousands of healthcare workers were unwittingly ""putting patients and their own families at risk"" by not having the flu jab. Image caption Health Secretary Shona Robison said she would urge all those eligible to be vaccinated against flu In the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, Health Secretary Shona Robison told MSPs the take-up among NHS staff was ""lower than we would want"". Ms Robison said ""ultimately"" it was a decision for each individual to take but urged those eligible to get the flu vaccination. The NHS recommends that anyone in health and social care who works directly with patients should get the vaccine. It also offers it to anyone working in: GP practices pharmacies hospitals childrens wards cancer centres intensive care dental surgeries care homes Are NHS staff selfish for not having the vaccination? Englands top doctor said flu was a ""double whammy"" for the NHS, increasing the number of patients and putting staff out of action. He said a third of people with the virus do not know they are carrying it so staff may not be aware they are putting patients, colleagues and their own families at risk. In 2011, the then chief medical officer in England, Dame Sally Davies, criticised those who did not get the jab, describing them as ""selfish"". BBC Scotland spoke to a number of doctors and nurses who said many believe the flu vaccine was ""ineffective"". One GP, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""When flu changes to a new strain, the old vaccine no longer works. ""The evidence is conflicted on the benefits. The current epidemic still happened despite the vaccination programme."" Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, agrees that take up is low because the evidence of its effectiveness is ""uncertain"". When the evidence is strong and makes a difference to patient care, health workers can be counted on to do the right thing."" Prof Carl Heneghan Prof Heneghan, who is also an out-of-hours GP, told BBC Scotland there was little good evidence on the benefits of giving the vaccination to healthy individuals in the NHS. He said: ""When the evidence is strong and makes a difference to patient care, health workers can be counted on to do the right thing."" However, the professor said not all vaccines were equal and others such as the measles jab had clear evidence of their effectiveness. He said the same evidence could not be claimed for the flu vaccination. A study into the vaccination of healthcare workers, published in 2016, pulled together trials looking at its effectiveness. It found such programmes ""probably have a small effect on lower respiratory tract infection but they may have little or no effect on admission to hospital"". Prof Heneghan said: ""The best way to reduce flu is scrupulous hand-washing between every patient. ""Barrier methods such as face masks and quarantine give reductions in the spread of all acute respiratory infections, not just flu."" Image caption Dr Catherine Calderwood said this years flu vaccine was a good match for the strain of virus Sinead McLean, a nurse at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, said she had the flu jab because she has asthma. She backs the vaccination programme and says it has been heavily promoted within the hospital. However, Ms McLean says that some colleagues have been too busy to get the jab, while others think it does not really help protect people from the flu. Scotlands chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said: ""This years flu vaccine is a good match for the current predominant strain of virus in Scotland and has an excellent safety record. ""Staff can protect themselves and their families and, importantly, reduce the spread of flu by being vaccinated."" Dr Calderwood said the 40% figure for all healthcare staff in Scotland was ""lower than I would like"" but she agreed it was not something that should be mandatory and the decision remained with each individual. She said: ""I have had my flu vaccine as it is very important for me to protect the pregnant women I see in my antenatal clinic and flu can be particularly harmful for pregnant women and their babies."" Patient care And while many medical staff avoid taking the vaccine, their leaders maintain its importance. BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Bennie said: ""NHS staff come into contact with patients suffering from flu on a day-to-day basis at work, and the virus contributes to our heavy workload at winter. ""Ironically, we often feel so busy that we dont think we can make the time to get vaccinated ourselves, but it is important to do so."" Theresa Fyffe, director of the Royal College of Nursing Scotland, said all nursing and other frontline staff should be vaccinated to protect both themselves and their patients. She said: ""While most cases of flu are mild, it can lead to complications for patients with health problems. ""Nursing teams and other staff are working extremely hard to ensure that they can provide quality patient care during this challenging winter period and we urge all frontline staff to get the vaccine as soon as possible.""",{},"['scotland', 'majority', 'workers', 'flu', 'nhs', 'vaccine', 'evidence', 'staff', 'vaccination', 'patients', 'health']","Image copyright PA Image caption Less than half of NHS staff take up the flu jab offerAll NHS staff in Scotland are offered a flu vaccination but less than half have had it.

Allan Wells 'took drugs ahead of gold medal win',A BBC investigation uncovers claims of drug taking by British 100m Olympic gold medallist Allan Wells.,,5 June 2015,BBC News,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Allan Wells won the 100m at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 A BBC investigation has uncovered claims of drug taking by British 100m Olympic gold medallist Allan Wells. Wells, who won the 100m in the Olympics in Moscow in 1980, is one of only three British athletes to win the elite race. The allegations against him include the sworn testimony of three men who knew him well and secretly recorded exchanges with former Great Britain team doctor Jimmy Ledingham. Allan Wells denied the allegations and attacked the BBC for a ""shocking slur"". In the years since his victory, the Edinburgh sprinter, who is now 63, has been an outspoken critic of drug cheats, calling for lifetime bans. However, the BBC documentary shown on Wednesday heard evidence that Wells was supplied with the anabolic steroid Stromba, or stanozalol, by Dr Ledingham. Ledingham was an Edinburgh GP who had been involved with Scottish athletes since at least 1977. He was heavily involved with the British athletics team in the 1970s and 80s, including acting as its medical officer at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wells was the first carrier of the Queens Baton, ahead of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games last year Drew McMaster, who won Commonwealth gold in 4 x 100m relay alongside Wells within the famous flying Scotsmen quartet - had secretly recorded conversations with Dr Ledingham, in which he apparently admitted supplying Wells with steroids. The BBC has obtained some of the transcripts of those conversations, the full extent of which has never been broadcast before. In one excerpt, Dr Ledingham - who died in 1998 - gave McMaster his reasons for doping athletes. He said: ""What I was doing it for was that I knew bloody well that the bloke standing next to you on the blocks was taking the stuff."" He was then asked if Allan Wells was also getting his steroids, or ""stuff"" from him. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Daly has this exclusive report on doping claims He said: ""He [Wells] was taking stuff from all over the place, not just from me … Everybody knew Wells took drugs."" Dr Ledingham said he would never speak on the record about Wells, or any of the other …""half a dozen or so Ive known to have taken things"". McMaster, who admitted taking steroids in 1995 after years of denials, told the BBC that athletes were coming from all over the UK to Dr Ledinghams surgery and said Wells was also a regular visitor. McMaster said as well as specifically telling him that he was supplying Wells with steroids, Dr Ledingham also talked to him about drug testing procedures and how to avoid a positive test. Allan Wells declined an interview with the BBC, but his lawyer said: ""It is denied that any drugs were provided by Dr Jimmy Ledingham. ""It is not true our client had used any banned performance drugs…at any…time in his athletics career."" Image caption Drew McMaster won relay gold alongside Wells at the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton in 1978 Allan Wells has previously attacked McMaster for speaking publicly about drugs, saying: ""The truth is, McMaster turned to steroids because I started beating him - and I was not using drugs."" Last week, Wells told the media: ""None of [my] medals were achieved with the aid of illegal performance-enhancing substances. Training, exceptional coaching and a dedication and desire to win were my only driving forces."" Image caption Allan Wells is one of only three British athletes to win Olympic gold in the 100m Journalist Andrew Malone worked on a series of stories about drugs in athletics during the Wells era. He said: ""The fact that the Olympic team doctor was talking so openly about his knowledge of the use of drugs and the fact that he felt it was his duty to try and make sure people didnt harm themselves, I found that absolutely astonishing. ""An Olympic team doctor saying that he was aware of at least half a dozen athletes taking illegal drugs … it gave it a sense it was institutionalised."" The BBC spoke to a man involved in Scottish athletics who was close to Allan Wells and Dr Ledingham, who has never voiced his concerns publicly and wishes to remain anonymous. He said he saw Wells transform from an unremarkable long jumper in 1976 into the one of the most powerful sprinters in the world, within two years. He said: ""I saw that Wells had this really big improvement in his performance. He suddenly started to run around six seconds dead for the 60 yards. Image caption Wells has maintained a high profile, here receiving a honorary degree from Napier University in Edinburgh ""Can an athlete go from 11st 7 to 14st and put on that build naturally? Not at that age. Not in my experience. ""When I started to notice changes in him, the changes were big, and they were obvious. It changed his personality - a bit of aggression - thats the side effects of steroids. ""Once I had my suspicions, I spoke to Ledingham about it. He told me, he told me straight to my face that Allan Wells was getting Stromba from him."" Sworn statement A former athlete who spoke to the BBC claimed detailed knowledge of Wells alleged drug use. He had given a sworn statement 20 years ago and told me, in a series of meetings, that his statement was true. The athlete, who wants to remain anonymous, alleged that Wells told him he started using Stromba in 1977 and was being supported medically by Dr Ledingham. He said that he and Wells compared notes about dosages, and when to come off the drug to beat the testers. And he claimed that Wells admitted using steroids close to the final of the Moscow Olympics. Some of the people the BBC spoke to about Allan Wells in this investigation are drugs cheats themselves. As well as his gold, Wells also won silver in the 200m at the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games. He was the 100m world cup champion in 1981 and also scooped four Commonwealth gold medals. He has maintained a high profile in the athletics world, acting as an ambassador for last years Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and also given the honour of being the first carrier of the Queens baton. Image copyright AFP Image caption Allan Wells beat Cubas Silvio Leonard to first place in the 100m in 1980 He has spoken out against drug cheats in the past, and once said he would sever ties with the British Olympic Association if the convicted doper Dwain Chambers was ever allowed to run for Britain at the Olympics again. He told a journalist in 2004: ""If you take a short cut to an Olympic gold medal then you deserve everything that happens to you."" Wells declined an interview with the BBC, but in a letter his lawyer said: ""Allan Wells enjoys the highest of reputations … he has never failed a drug test [and] was subjected to the most rigorous and random drug testing regime applied to any athlete at that time."" Wells added: ""I remember running in a major event in Europe on 2/7/1980 [three weeks before the 100m final in Moscow] where drug testing was taking place, as they regularly tested at this level."" Wells criticised the BBC over the allegations, describing them as a ""shocking slur"" and ""gossip of the vilest kind"", and said some of his teammates, including Drew McMaster, had been discredited by their own involvement in drug use. He added: ""I can look back with substantial pride on my individual achievements. None of these medals were achieved with the aid of illegal performance-enhancing substances.

Produksi seri televisi Charlie Sheen dihentikan,"Produksi seri televisi Two and a Half Men dihentikan setelah bintangnya, Charlie Sheen, mengecam produser seri di radio.",,25 Februari 2011,BBC News Indonesia,"Hak atas foto Reuters Image caption Produksi Two and a Half Men dihentikan setelah Charlie Sheen mengecam produser seri di wawancara radio Produksi seri televisi Amerika Two and a Half Men dihentikan karena pernyataan yang dikeluarkan bintangnya, Charlie Sheen. Sheen mengecam keras produser program itu dalam sebuah wawancara radio hari Kamis (24/2). Keputusan itu didasarkan pada ""keseluruhan dari berbagai pernyataan, tindakan dan kondisi Charlie Sheen"", demikian pernyataan bersama tertulis studio televisi Warner Bros Television dan jaringan televisi CBS. Produksi film telah ditangguhkan sejak akhir Januari setelah Charlie Sheen, putra aktor veteran Hollywood Martin Sheen, masuk ke fasilitas rehabilitasi narkoba dan alkohol. Juru bicara Charlie Sheen sebelumnya pada hari yang sama mengatakan bahwa Two and a Half Men akan melanjutkan produksi minggu depan, ketika Sheen menyelesaikan program rehabilitasinya.

The Cardiff project is still being evaluated and the pilot is not under way yet. Announcing the pilot, Home Secretary Theresa May said: ""We all know there is a significant minority in this country who drink dangerously and who cause disproportionate harm.

"'Skunk-like cannabis' increases risk of psychosis, study suggests",Using potent forms of cannabis is a factor in 24% of new psychosis cases analysed by King's College London researchers.,,16 February 2015,BBC News,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Former skunk user Liaquat Zaman: ""It brought me to a very dark place in my life"" Smoking potent cannabis was linked to 24% of new psychosis cases analysed in a study by Kings College London. The research suggests the risk of psychosis is three times higher for users of potent ""skunk-like"" cannabis than for non-users. The study of 780 people was carried out by KCLs Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience. A Home Office spokesman said the report underlines the reasons why cannabis is illegal. Scientists found the risk of psychosis was five times higher for those who use it every day compared with non-users. They also concluded the use of hash, a milder form of the drug, was not associated with increased risk of psychosis. Psychosis refers to delusions or hallucinations that can be present in certain psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Risk increased threefold ""Compared with those who had never tried cannabis, users of high potency skunk-like cannabis had a threefold increase in risk of psychosis, said Dr Marta Di Forti, lead author on the research. She added: ""The results show that psychosis risk in cannabis users depends on both the frequency of use and cannabis potency."" Dr Di Forti told BBC Radio 4s Today programme that the availability of skunk-like cannabis was becoming more widespread. Image copyright AP I was a wreck Cath from Berkshire, who asked to remain anonymous, believes smoking skunk caused her to experience mental health problems. ""I dabbled with a friends group in my early 20s, and went from someone who had never experienced any mental health issues whatsoever, to an absolute wreck. ""I was terrified of leaving the house, and I became petrified of death, of the mysteries of the universe, and of being alone. You name it, I was terrified of it. ""It took about six years to feel normal again and now, almost 20 years later, I have absolutely no doubt that my issues were triggered by casually and naively smoking this so called soft drug. ""For years I have shuddered as campaigners have sought to declassify or promote the product as I understand first-hand the hidden yet, until now, unspoken dangers of this awful drug."" ""In London, its very difficult to find anything else,"" Dr Di Forti said. ""There were lots of reports from police across the UK saying we have become a great producer of skunk. And not only do we use it locally but we export, so this is a Made in England product."" Someone suffering from psychosis would often be ""extremely paranoid and become very suspicious"" about the people around them, she added. She has called for ""a clear public message"" to cannabis users, comparable to medical advice on alcohol and tobacco. GPs should be encouraged to ask how often and what type of cannabis patients use, she added, A Home Office spokesman said the findings backed up the governments approach: ""Drugs such as cannabis are illegal because scientific and medical evidence demonstrates they are harmful. ""This report serves to emphasise how they can destroy lives and communities."" Without risk Skunk contains more THC - the main psychoactive ingredient - than other types of cannabis. Unlike skunk, hashish - cannabis resin - contains substantial quantities of another chemical called cannabidiol or CBD and research suggests this can act as an antidote to the THC, counteracting psychotic side effects. Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at Kings, commented: ""This paper suggests that we could prevent almost one quarter of cases of psychosis if no-one smoked high potency cannabis. ""This could save young patients a lot of suffering and the NHS a lot of money."" The research was carried out over several years, comparing 410 patients aged 18-65 who reported a first episode of psychosis at a south London psychiatric hospital with 370 healthy participants within the same age range from the same area of London. It will be published later this week in the Lancet Psychiatry. Rosanna OConnor, director of alcohol, drugs and tobacco at Public Health England, responded: ""No drug use is without risk as this report demonstrates. ""Anyone having problems with drug use should seek help from their local specialist drug services. It is important to remember that treatment for all types of drug problems, including cannabis, are readily available and very effective"". Cannabis user Robert, from Hertfordshire experienced a ""temporary psychosis"" after taking home-grown cannabis in his 20s. ""It was utterly terrifying, and the worst night of my life,"" he told the BBC News website. ""As someone affected by this issue it is hard watching mainstream media, particularly comedy films, portraying cannabis as a harmless life-enhancing substance with limited ill-effects - its simply not true."" Another person who contacted the BBC website felt that legalising cannabis would allow varieties to be regulated. Phil, from Cambridgeshire, said: ""Speaking as a toker for past 25 years, super skunk is the term they should be using. ""The cause of all this is the illegality. If things were more open and informed, people could buy saner variety seeds.""",{},"['report', 'suggests', 'skunk', 'skunklike', 'research', 'users', 'risk', 'cannabis', 'study', 'increases', 'drug', 'psychosis']","The research suggests the risk of psychosis is three times higher for users of potent ""skunk-like"" cannabis than for non-users.

'Lost' Scotch whiskies to be revived,Malt whisky facilities in Sutherland and on Islay are to reopen with £35m investment.,,9 October 2017,BBC News,"Image copyright Whisky Highland Image caption Whisky from the island of Islay, including a 1970 bottle from the distillery of Port Ellen The spirits of two ""lost"" Scotch whisky distilleries are to be re-incarnated with a major investment in production. Distilling giant Diageo is to invest £35m in malt whisky facilities in Brora, Sutherland, and Port Ellen on Islay. The intention is to tap into whisky experts enthusiasm for single malts made until 34 years ago. Bottlings from before 1983 - when both distilleries closed - command high prices from collectors. The Brora site is adjacent to the Clynelish distillery, and the Port Ellen Distillery is close to Diageos malting plant on the island, and to Lagavulin. At the time of the closures, the industry was over-producing and single malts were yet to have an impact. Poor management is now attributed with the failure to sustain and grow markets. Diageo said it would seek to replicate, where possible, the distillation regimes and spirit character of the original distilleries. They will have capacity of about 800,000 litres of alcohol per year - less than half the usual scale for malt production, and less a tenth of the biggest malt distilleries. Cask filling and traditional warehousing will also be included on the sites of both distilleries, as well as a visitor centre. Production is scheduled to start in 2020. Diageo, which has two-fifths of the Scotch whisky market, said it was responding to calls from whisky fans around the world to re-open Brora and Port Ellen. There has also been strong demand for single malt whiskies, while blended whiskies have struggled in recent years to hold their sales figures. Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity In April, Diageo released its annual rare bottlings, with examples from both the distilleries being re-opened. Three thousand bottles of 34-year old Brora malt, distilled in 1982, were put on the market, for £1,450. As many bottles of 37-year old Port Ellen, distilled in 1979, were being sold for £2,625 each. Both are 51% alcohol by volume. David Cutter, president of global supply and procurement at Diageo, said: ""This is no ordinary Scotch whisky distillery investment. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring those iconic distilleries back to life."" Cristina Diezhandino, Diageos global scotch category director, said: ""Brora and Port Ellen are rightly revered around the world for their rarity and exceptional quality.

Dean Rippon jailed for life for Christopher Swailes murder,A killer who could not bear to look at photos of the injuries he inflicted on his victim in his Scottish Borders home is jailed for life.,,1 June 2012,BBC News,"Image caption Dean Rippon was jailed for life for the murder of Christopher Swailes A killer who could not bear to look at photos of the injuries he inflicted on his victim has been jailed for life. Dean Rippon, 20, was ordered to be detained for at least 19 years for murdering Christopher Swailes, 43, at the victims home in Hawick. A judge at the High Court in Edinburgh told him that the attack he committed was so awful it was difficult to find words which adequately described it. Lady Smith added: ""Vicious, brutal and wicked seem inadequate."" She said: ""The photographs of what you did to this poor man are deeply, deeply distressing."" She pointed out that 14 stab and laceration wounds were inflicted on Mr Swailes, as well as mutilation to the left side of the forehead. The judge said it was suspected that a filleting knife and whisky bottle were used on the victim in the fatal attack. Lady Smith said knife crime was a scourge of Scottish society as was the use of bottles to attack other people. We are satisfied with the life sentence but our thoughts are very much with Christopher Swailes family and friends today, and we hope the sentencing will bring them some kind of closure Det Insp Stuart Houston She told Rippon, formerly of Stonefield Place, Hawick, that she would have ordered that he serve a minimum term of 21 years before he becomes eligible to seek parole, but for his guilty plea in the case. The judge said he had a record as ""a troublemaker"" on a number of occasions and that his previous convictions were mainly for public disorder offences ""usually involving the excessive consumption of alcohol as was the case on this occasion"". She said: ""Christopher Swailes was a much-loved father and son. ""He was part of a close family who greatly valued the part he played in their lives."" Unemployed Rippon earlier admitted murdering Mr Swailes at his home in Liddesdale Road, in Hawick, on 13 November last year. The victim died after suffering a stab wound to the chest and blunt force head injuries. Defence counsel Neil Murray QC said: ""There is no excusing what he did - that is perfectly accepted by him."" He said: ""I am advised that those who knew him were totally taken aback by the degree of violence he exhibited and indeed that he exhibited homicidal violence. ""What he did seems to have taken the whole local community aback. ""It is quite clear that he takes what he did to heart - the remorse he has articulated does seem to be genuine,"" he added. Significantly disturbed He said that when photos of the deceased were produced Rippon could not look at them. The defence counsel added that Rippon had ""a significantly disturbed background"". Det Insp Stuart Houston, who led the investigation, said: ""We are satisfied with the life sentence but our thoughts are very much with Christopher Swailes family and friends today, and we hope the sentencing will bring them some kind of closure.

"Loneliness 'affects Devon pensioners' health', MP Nick Harvey says","The ""unspoken problem"" of loneliness is affecting the physical and mental health of 19,000 pensioners in Devon, an MP says.",,11 July 2012,BBC News,"Image caption The MP said it was morally right to ensure elderly people were not living in isolation Loneliness could be causing physical and mental problems for thousands of elderly people in Devon, according to one of the countys MPs. Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Devon, said it was a major issue which should be taken seriously both locally and nationally. Research, he said, showed 10% of over 65s were lonely - meaning ""Devon had 19,000 lonely pensioners"". He said it was important to identify those at risk of social isolation. Lives cut short According to the Office for National Statistics, between 20 and 30% of North Devons population in 2009 was over the age of 65 and the South West had the highest migration of people over the age of 60 in England - reflecting retirement to coastal areas. Mr Harvey said plans by the government to work with the care and support sector to develop measures of loneliness should help older people in his constituency to receive the help and support they needed to re-connect to their communities. ""Loneliness is one of societys unspoken problems,"" the MP said. ""Far too many people live alone, without day-to-day contact with friends, family and neighbours."" He said it was morally right to ensure no-one lived in isolation, when research showed that loneliness had ""as direct an influence on mortality as the effects of alcohol and tobacco"". Loneliness is one of societys unspoken problems Nick Harvey MP If the issue was not addressed, Mr Harvey said, elderly people in Devon would continue to have their lives cut short. ""I believe the more we can do to provide people with the social contact they need to stay physically and mentally well, the better,"" he added. Christina Victor, from the Campaign to End Loneliness, said research over decades had shown that between 6% and 13% of older people feel lonely ""often or always"". The campaign - set up in 2010 by Age UK Oxfordshire, Counsel and Care, Independent Age and WRVS - said increased longevity was leading to more people living alone for longer. It said families in the UK were becoming increasingly dispersed, with children moving greater distances away from their parents.

Six straight hours on Night Tube,"What one writer witnessed on London's new, open-all-night subway service",Tara Isabella Burton,2016-11-30 00:00:00,,"It is almost midnight at Paddington Station in central London. Everybody is sitting in half-frozen metal chairs in front of the platform’s arrivals information board, ignoring each other. Except, that is, for the man who is wearing a neon-bright yellow traffic cone as a hat. He does not respond when I ask him about his hat, where he’s been, where he’s going. His eyes are bloodshot. Only when he drops his train ticket and I hand it back to him does he acknowledge me; a moment later, he promptly forgets I exist. I’ve taken on the assignment of exploring the Night Tube until dawn. I have six hours to go. London’s Night Tube is a relatively new phenomenon, despite years of strike-related delays and political promises — Boris Johnson first announced the programme in 2013. Evening service on the Victoria and Central lines began in late September; 50,000 people used the service during its inaugural Friday night. By the time all five planned lines are open, Transport for London expects the service to garner 200,000 nightly visitors. The Jubilee line opened on October 7; the Northern and Piccadilly lines, which run roughly north-south and east-west through Central London into its suburbs, are slated to open later this year. For the first time, London — whose late-night-transport options have heretofore been limited to expensive cabs, surge-price Ubers, and the notoriously dodgy night buses — has the chance to be the city that never sleeps. I’m more anxious than I expected at the prospect of spending my night talking to strangers on the Tube, despite the veneer of legitimacy afforded by my being technically ‘at work’. Only recently, a quixotic American National Heath Service worker distributed 500 chirpy “Tube Chat?” badges to passengers. The badges were designed to foster the same benevolent openness the worker remembered from his hometown in Colorado. But the effort resulted in a cynical counter-campaign of brusque and obscene badges (“No” was among the most polite) designed to remind locals and foreigners alike that London was emphatically not a place for human connection. At least, not by day. * * * I’ve had strange and surreal encounters on other forms of late-night transport the world over: the middle-aged woman on a New York subway carriage who approached me to tell me excitedly that she’d just made the acquaintance of two male prostitutes, the maternal ministrations of elderly women who have tried to feed me crackers on Turkish intercities night buses, the strangely unguarded vodka-fuelled conversations I’ve had with strangers on Central Asian night trains. There is something carnival-like about late-night transit, especially alcohol-fueled urban transit, that allows us to break the rules of social interaction. By day, trains and buses are purely functional: they get us to where we need to go. But by night, they’re a rare example of an enclosed public space, somewhere that allows for, even demands, social interaction, the breaking of barriers. There is something carnival-like about late-night transit. And in England, where even making eye contact with strangers involves a kind of shredding of the social contract, people seem to hunger more intensely than anywhere else than for a breaking of those barriers. “Everyone’s happy on the Night Tube,” muses David, a young security guard at Victoria station. He, like everyone else I speak with for this story, identifies himself only by his first name. (Asking strangers for their full names on the Night Tube, I discover, has the effect of making them immediately revert to extreme English reserve). “It’s just young people, having fun.” He says this with a degree of shock. “Of course, we have to clear up all the vomit…” But in a city where strangers famously ignore one another, the Night Tube is a carnival experience: a place where ordinary social codes don’t apply. I decide to see for myself one Saturday night in October. * * * Ten minutes later on the Victoria line, I’m swigging a sip Jacob’s Creek Shiraz rosé straight from the bottle courtesy of my new friend, Charlie. Charlie, whom I approached after noticing his rather public pre-gaming strategy, is on his way to Brixton to see the DJ Armin van Buuren. Charlie scribbles the DJ’s name into my notebook, along with the fact that he recently made #1 on DJ Magazine’s Top 1 DJs. Charlie works in music production, he says; he likes going to dance at trance events like this one. Tube-drinking, he hints, is far cheaper than paying for drinks at the club. As I take the Victoria line back and forth between Brixton and Seven Sisters stations, the Night Tube gets more and more raucous, its characters more and more colourful. (The Victoria line is, I quickly discover, the liveliest line, although the Oxford Circus stop is closed due to a fire alert.) I notice more and more empty bottles of alcohol on the station platforms: a Bells at Walthamstow, cans of cheap cider on the Tube floors. I see strikingly-attired riders — a woman with pagan rings and two-toned platinum-black hair; a man in full-face clown make-up — who get off the Tube and vanish before I can approach them. Around midnight, things settle into patterns. Two men loudly argue about Trump. A bald man in tweed and a purple scarf reading a copy of Wired takes one look at them before putting on the largest pair of headphones I have ever seen. He gets off at the genteel, politically liberal neighborhood of Highbury & Islington. People don’t talk to each other in London"" — But they grant that the Night Tube is an exception. Three men — Ayo, in a bright yellow shirt, Samuel, with a bushy beard, and Damir, with a bandana and piercings — Snapchat their way north from Brixton. They came all the way from North Finchley (thirty away) to go to a party at the Brixton nightclub Eckovision, only to realise it’s closed for renovations. “Now we have to go all the way across London,” one says, before they begin to argue about whether or not Brixton to Finchley technically constitutes ‘all the way.’ The consensus: if you don’t change Tube lines, it’s not that bad. They admit that talking to me is somewhat bizarre. “People don’t talk to each other in London,” Ayo says. But they grant that the Night Tube is an exception. I ask if they too have been drinking. They shrug. “I don’t drink,” they all tell me. Somehow, though, the Night Tube makes everybody seem a little bit drunk. * * * Almost nobody, though, is as drunk as Zeyna, the pink-haired, leather-clad girl I rescue from a “Not in Service” train from Victoria station. Her friends have deposited her in the carriage — they have somewhere else to go. She still wants to go out, she says; the night is young. “Shut the hell up,” she tells me (her language is cruder) when I try to explain the train isn’t going anywhere. Finally, I convince her to come back to the platform. “I just wanted to shake a leg,” she sighs. She and her friends had gone to Konnect nightclub, hoping for a good time. But the cover charge was unaffordable, the queues too long. “I just wanted to shake a leg, to dab, you know.” To ‘dab’? This, she explains, is a dance move. She corrals Tasha, a young man in a “Normal People Scare Me” T-shirt, to play music off his iPhone so she can show me what she means. She and Tasha don’t know each other; he says he’s on his way to a secret warehouse party in an undisclosed location in North London. As we board the next train, Zeyna starts asking him chipper questions: whether or not he has children, how old he is. When she discovers that he, like me, is 26, she gleefully pronounces us “twins”. “I’m 23,” she informs me, teetering in her too-tall ankle boots. “I’m an adult. I can walk in my shoes and everything!” She tells me about the wreckage of her night. She ran into an old acquaintance in Victoria: “He just got out of jail for selling white and brown” — cocaine and heroin, she translates for clarification — “his cousin’s in jail, and I was annoyed, you know, because when we were kids I told him like ten times don’t go to jail.” She ran into another girl who just got out of rehab (“I’m friends with a lot of drug dealers,” she reflects, “but I don’t do any drugs”), drank vodka and juice in the street to avoid paying at the club (“It’s expensive to buy drinks; I don’t spend money when I go out”), got too drunk too early. She still wants to go out, she says; the night is young. But her friends have gone and she has nowhere left to go. She decides to go home at King’s Cross at one-thirty in the morning. “Goodbye!” She gives me a big hug before she leaves. “I love you!” * * * By 2am, the Victoria line becomes more raucous still. A man called Nigel gets on at Brixton with a boom box hooked up to an iPhone, on which he plays increasingly loud 80’s hits. An Eastern European woman sitting near him gets up, sniffs, and walks off the carriage. “I’m glad Brexit happened!” Nigel shouts after her. He turns to me in a rage. “I mean — if you come to somebody’s house, you don’t complain about their music, right?” He says that playing music on the Night Tube is his hobby. “I mean, I’m not smoking, I’m not drinking, right?” Three boys in their 20s find Nigel and his 80’s hits hilarious. As Soft Cell’s Tainted Love blares, they begin to sing along, to encourage the rest of the carriage to do so, to start shaking a leg, to pole dance against the subway poles. One grinning boy is covered in lipstick kisses. (“My fault!” a girl announces.) One person starts dancing, then another. We sing along, in unison, to Don’t You Want Me, Baby. Everybody in the carriage films it. By the time Nigel gets to the Eurythmics’ Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), the entire carriage is dancing. Nigel gets off at King’s Cross. Everybody applauds. We sing along, in unison, to Don’t You Want Me, Baby. Everybody in the carriage films it. Things get quieter after 3am. The Jubilee line, running west into Mayfair, is largely silent; a boy in a tailored purple blazer tries very hard not to vomit while his companion, wearing seersucker trousers, props him up. Eastbound, there are the remnants of a birthday party: a group of men hugging each other while one of their mothers looks on. One accidentally jostles the other; this starts a mild argument until one of the older women pretends to call the police. “Hello, is this 999? Somebody’s stepped on my son’s toe — can you help?” There are empty Tube carriages, too, and empty platforms; Stratford, at 3:30am, has only a pair of boys mock-fighting. Things liven up on the Central line between Liverpool Street and Oxford Circus. A young man with a Cockney accent goes around the carriage asking sport trivia questions: “Other than West Ham, what is the main East London team?” When an elegantly-dressed man in a blazer and button-down shirt answers “Leyton Orient,” he is rewarded with a handshake. The Tube’s passengers begin arguing about the respective merits of the football teams. A solitary middle-aged man, standing against the pole, takes a few steps closer, trying to make eye contact, to join the conversation. But nobody looks up to see him, and he is too shy to speak out loud. At the corner of the carriage, two bald and bearded men — one with a chain necklace and a black leather jacket, one with curiously mismatched clothes evocative of a Gilbert and Sullivan pirate — smile at each other. They communicate in sign language while mouthing their words. I like your hair, one jokes. I like your hair, too. * * * On the London night bus, the seats do not face each other. People curl up against the windows: they doze, or vomit, or avoid one another. But on a subway, it is difficult not to make eye contact. Drunk or sober, hyped up on Red Bull or downing Jacob’s Creek from the bottle, it becomes easy, even natural, to smile at strangers, to strike up a conversation, to let the rollicking atmosphere of drunkenness take over, to let London be less lonely. A Night Tube isn’t just a functional addition to a city, it’s a psychological one. If urban planners in other famously anonymous big cities — Tokyo, say, or Seoul were to build 24/7 trains there, one wonders if those famously quiet carriages would devolve into dance parties of their own. By morning, at the end of my Night Tube marathon, people are silent once more. The revellers are gone; the commuters are up. They do not shake hands. They do not make eye contact. They doze, or read the free papers that litter the train, or stare at their phones. Outside King’s Cross, on the Hammersmith and City line, a middle-aged man with a suitcase, just off the Eurostar and with a Northern English accent, looks up at the carriage. “I guess we’re all supposed to talk on the Tube now, eh?” he says. He laughs, increasingly awkwardly, into the silence, as everybody tenses up. Nobody answers him.

Pregnancy advice 'scaremongering',Author says some pregnancy advice is misleading.,,3 January 2013,BBC News,"Pregnancy is a huge, life-changing period in a womans life and there is no shortage of advice about what is best for your unborn child. But in this weeks Scrubbing Up, Linda Geddes, the author of Bumpology, argues this can sometimes be misleading and scaremongering. Expectant parents are bombarded with advice about what they should and shouldnt be doing. Pregnant women mustnt eat too much as it may raise the babys risk of obesity or diabetes, but they mustnt diet as that could have a similar effect. Neither should they exercise for fear of triggering a miscarriage, or get too stressed out because thats bad for the baby too. And if they do get stressed, they cant drink alcohol or go for a spa treatment to relax. You might start to think that staying at home would be the sensible thing to do, only this too is ridden with potential dangers for your unborn child: from ice-cream, to pet shampoo, to hair dye. Even lying down or your back can allegedly cut off your babys blood supply. When I fell pregnant three years ago, I felt paralysed and somewhat patronised by all the conflicting advice out there. I was also obsessed with the little life that was growing inside me, and desperate for more information about what it was doing in there. Could it taste the curry I was eating; hear the songs I was singing; or sense when I took a swim in the freezing outdoor swimming pool near my home? So I began a quest to investigate the truth behind the old wives tales, alarming newspaper headlines and government guidelines, and to probe deeper into the inner world of the developing child. So Bumpology was born. Booze and breastfeeding Some of what I discovered while researching the book amused and amazed me: I learned that parents who already have a couple of boys are statistically more likely to go on having boys, though no-one really understands why; that the shape of a womans bump provides no clues as to the gender of the baby within, but that women with severe morning sickness are slightly more likely to be carrying a girl; and that contrary to the received wisdom, babies actually can focus on objects further than 30cm away (even if they often under- or overshoot). I also learned that much of the research underpinning medical advice on things like alcohol consumption - and even the health benefits of breastfeeding - is far from clear-cut and often aimed at the general population, rather than taking the individual into consideration. In the case of alcohol, theres clear evidence that heavy drinking is harmful -- and even a daily glass of wine may increase the odds of a baby being born underweight, which carries additional risks to its health. However, below this level, there is a massive grey zone where scientists simply dont yet have an answer to whether or not alcohol causes harm. When it comes to breastfeeding, its quite true that breast milk is best for babies, or at least better than formula milk in terms of protecting them against infections in the short term. But when it comes to the much-touted long-term benefits of breastfeeding, such as protection against obesity, diabetes or allergy, the research is less convincing. Certainly women who cant breastfeed for whatever reason, and who live in countries with a decent standard of health care, shouldnt waste too much time worrying that they are causing long-term damage to their babys health. Overblown However, what alarmed me the most was the realisation that much of what women are told about the risks of medical interventions during labour - things like induction, epidural anaesthesia and undergoing a c-section - are overblown. At the same time, statistics about the odds of needing medical assistance or on complications like tearing during a vaginal birth are frequently not talked about. I believe that access to this kind of information could have a big influence on womens expectations of labour and on some of the decisions they make when planning for the birth of their child. I also think it could help women to come to terms with things if labour doesnt go according to plan and they need additional help getting their baby out. Having a baby can be one of the greatest joys that life bestows. However, it is also hard work and new parents can do without the unnecessary guilt, anxiety and doubt that misleading pregnancy advice brings. It is also a time of great wonder and through my research I have learned things about my own children that will never cease to amaze me. I believe its time to push aside the scaremongering and allow parents the freedom to enjoy this precious period of their lives.",{},"['advice', 'research', 'women', 'scaremongering', 'baby', 'things', 'life', 'alcohol', 'pregnancy', 'medical', 'learned', 'parents']","Pregnancy is a huge, life-changing period in a woman's life and there is no shortage of advice about what is best for your unborn child.

Gin is the tonic for a creative boom in the drinks business,"Four centuries after gin was introduced to Britain, a new generation of boutique microdistilleries is driving a revival of the beverage.",,29 December 2011,BBC News,"Image caption A new generation of bespoke gin distilleries is leading to a creative boom in the drinks business Four centuries after gin was introduced to Britain, a new generation of boutique distilleries - some in residential homes - is driving a British gin revival. Behind an anonymous door in an office block in north London, serious-looking women wearing white lab coats are pouring and measuring liquids. A machine spins away on a counter, and off to the side something white and viscous is bubbling away in a flask. The din of machinery and hushed whispers in technical language bring to mind medical research or nuclear science. But all of this activity is dedicated to the art of the cocktail - and much of it is devoted to finding the perfect companion to the queen of spirits, gin. Remixing a classic Tony Conigliaro is the chief bartender - he eschews the term ""mixologist"" - and his lab is constantly making new raw materials for his two cocktail bars, as well as undertaking research for outside clients. People are drinking less, but they are drinking better Sam Galsworthy, Sipsmith microdistillery ""With the influence of chefs around the world, we wanted to match that with a level of accuracy and new innovative ideas, flavours and flavour combinations,"" he says. The labs shelves are lined with herbs, spices and plants such as dandelion leaf, Szechuan pepper, angelica root, hibiscus, lemon verbena, white chocolate and nettle - all building blocks for new drinks. Of course, cocktails have long been on the menu in British bars and pubs. But instead of sweet fizzy drinks and easily chugged shots, these are concoctions for a more sophisticated drinker. And the real key to Conigliaros recipes lies in the alcoholic kick provided by a new breed of distillers. ""Theres some really interesting gins coming out,"" he says. Image caption The Drunkards Children by George Cruikshank depicts the seedier side of Londons infamous gin palaces of the mid-19th Century ""Their structure is interesting and theyre using new botanicals. Whats being produced is phenomenal. ""Were selling more gin martinis than ever before,"" he says. ""Considering its 80% gin, that means that people are liking gin."" Domestic distilleries London is in the midst of a craft distilling revival. Image caption Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, founders of the microdistillery Sipsmith and their distiller, Prudence New microdistilleries can be found in residential houses - such as Sacred Spirits, based in Londons sedate Highgate. And theyre tucked away in terraces - such as gin and vodka makers Sipsmith in Hammersmith. These new distillers are a far cry from the back-street operators who turned out rough booze in the 19th Century. The gory excess of Londons spirit craze at that time was gruesomely portrayed in the artwork of George Cruikshank and William Hogarth - whose print Gin Lane depicts dead babies, binge-drinking children and starving alcoholics. People are really sick of mainstream mass-produced brands Spiros Malandrakis, Euromonitor It is not exactly a refined image of alcohol - but despite this, some of todays gin makers still take a measure of inspiration from the past. ""We try to reflect the old school way of distilling, which is known as one-shot,"" says Sipsmith co-founder Sam Galsworthy. He proudly shows off Prudence - distillers traditionally give their stills female names. She is an impressively gleaming room-sized copper machine, but she could easily fit several times over in just one of the stills used by bigger spirits brands. ""We do not blend, we do not make a concentrate,"" Galsworthy says. ""People are drinking less, but they are drinking better. If theyre going to have a gin and tonic, theyre going to have a better gin and tonic, theyre just going to have it less frequently. ""That is one of the indicators that will happen in a recession."" Next big gin And since gin is often mentioned in the same breath as tonic, perhaps it is no surprise that other businesspeople have opted to remix the mixer. Co-founder Charles Rolls used to work for Plymouth Gin, but he grew to hate the metallic flavour and bitter aftertaste of saccharin - the dominant sweetener in most tonic waters today. ""I was always frustrated by the fact that when we could show the differences between these great gins - the way they smell with the different botanicals - when you went to mix them, they always just smelt of the tonic."" Fever Tree, established in 2005, now produces a range of soft drinks, and Rolls says the company shipped 30 million bottles in 2011. These new companies are operating in a tough economic climate, but even more surprising is that some are thriving in a stable-to-declining market for gin, one that is dominated by big brands with marketing clout. Spiros Malandrakis, drinks analyst at marketing research firm Euromonitor, thinks craft gin could be the next big spirit, even though he notes the overall global gin market posted a 1% decline in total volume sold in 2010. ""While the top-line figures might look sobering at first, if we dig a bit deeper we know that there are segments where we can see optimism and buoyancy,"" he says. ""People are really sick of mainstream mass-produced brands. They want something different, they want something with character. ""They want something to reflect where theyre coming from and what their values are,"" he says. Since Sipsmith opened up the first new copper-pot distillery in London for nearly two centuries - requiring the issuing of a special licence - at least half a dozen more distillers have opened up elsewhere in the capital, some in the most unlikely places. ""I just found out recently that a small distillery will be opening up in my building in Hackney Wick,"" Malandrakis says. ""Its weird... and wonderful.""

Fresh fears over PMA being used in ecstasy pills,The government agency responsible for drug prevention has said it is concerned with an apparent rise in the number of ecstasy-related deaths.,,None,,"The government agency responsible for drug prevention has said it is concerned with an apparent rise in the number of ecstasy-related deaths. It is feared some tablets currently being sold as ecstasy actually contain the Class A drug PMA. Hospitals have been sent alerts about the effects of it, which can be stronger than MDMA (ecstasy). In 2012, there were at least 10 UK fatalities where PMA contributed towards or caused the death. The figures, seen by Newsbeat, show in 2011, there were at least four deaths involving the drug, whilst in 2010, there were none. Rosanna OConnor, director of alcohol and drugs for Public Health England, said shed been alerted to PMA in ecstasy tablets in recent months. ""The actual make-up of what people think theyre buying, when theyre buying ecstasy tablets, changes all the time and this particular phenomena around PMA is a very recent one. ""It looks like a very concerning rise in the number of deaths from these types of drugs."" Club drug clinic Dr Owen Bowden-Jones is consultant psychiatrist at the Club Drug Clinic, based at the Chelsea & Westminster Hospital in London.

One of the problems with PMA is the time it takes for the effect to come on is a bit longer than MDMA,"" he said. ""People will take a pill thinking its MDMA and then go, well its not worked, so theyll take another one and what theyre actually doing is double dosing. ""What we understand is the the number of deaths from PMA appear to be higher than MDMA, despite many more taking MDMA. The suggestion is that PMA is more dangerous."" There have been a string of deaths linked to ecstasy-type pills recently which led to police forces around the country issuing warnings about batches of fake tablets. The street names for PMA can often be the same as those for MDMA, with monikers such as green rolex, Dr Death or pink ecstasy. Skin was trying to burst One woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told Newsbeat about the last few times shed taken what she thought was MDMA. ""It didnt feel nice. You didnt feel warm, you didnt feel comfortable,"" she said. ""You just felt annoyed and when you tried to go to sleep I felt like someone had stuck hot air in me and my skin was trying to burst."" Without testing its hard to say what she took but some of the described side effects point to PMA. What is PMA? PMA stands for para-Methoxyamphetamine Has been a Class A drug since 1977 Similar effect to MDMA (ecstasy) but stronger Takes longer to have an effect than MDMA Sends body temperature soaring In recent weeks, the UK Department of Health, the Chief Medical Officers in Wales and Northern Ireland and the Scottish Government have all alerted hospitals and medical teams to the current threat of fake ecstasy tablets and PMA. One suggestion of PMAs recent prominence is that the main precursor chemical to it, anethole, is currently easier to get hold of than the precursor to MDMA, safrole but there could be other reasons.

"Therapy to tackle ""love addiction""",,,2010-03-19 17:50:51,,"FROM BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. More from BBC Radio 5 live Tiger Woods admission that hes been receiving therapy to enable him to remain faithful to his wife has raised the question of whether infidelity is really the symptom of a treatable condition. BBC Radio 5 lives Andrew Fletcher visits a treatment centre in Hertfordshire to see how counsellors tackle love and sex addiction in the same way as alcoholism - through group therapy. In a small, plainly-decorated room at the end of a shopping arcade in Stevenage, nine women and two men sit in a circle. They will spend the day talking, listening and sometimes crying. All consider themselves to be love addicts. Two of the three counsellors have recovered from what they describe as an inability to have a normal, healthy relationship. They have allowed me to join their group for the day, to hear their stories of obsession, manipulation and attachment to sometimes violent partners. Pain A common theme emerges from the stories - the compulsion to experience the pain caused by obsessive relationships. When one describes it as the need to fill a hole within herself, others nod in agreement. They say the romantic songs and movies which dominate popular culture are literally played out in their own lives, but without the happy endings. ""I used to tell people we were like Romeo and Juliet"", one woman says of a relationship which friends envied, ""... but actually Romeo and Juliet killed themselves."" ""I feel that love addiction is more commonplace than people think, and quite likely to be on a par with alcoholism"" General practitioner Dr James Brooke Another client breaks down as she talks about the time when her unhappy marriage caused her to consider committing suicide and killing her four children: ""It wasnt a cry for help; they were detailed plans. ""No-one would have found us. ""But my indecision saved my life, and I didnt go through with it."" She was obsessed with her husband and couldnt bring herself to leave him. She began eating compulsively, reflecting the experience of other clients whose obsessive behaviour in relationships has been accompanied by alcoholism or drug addiction. Scepticism ""My experience was getting involved in unhealthy, damaging relationships, and kind of knowing that they were unhealthy but not being able to stop myself,"" says Laura, whos been receiving treatment at the Living Room for the past 14 months. FROM BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. More from BBC Radio 5 live She understands the scepticism of people who find the idea of being addicted to love hard to believe: ""I wouldve said the same thing a couple of years ago....what a load of rubbish"", she says. ""But unless youve actually been in it, you dont know. ""You really need to experience the pain of it, and the pain of coming out of it."" For Laura, that has involved weekly therapy sessions and an agreement to try to abstain from any relationship for at least a year. The Living Room uses the 12-step programme, familiar from the treatment of alcoholics, alongside other forms of therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy. Some clients refer themselves for treatment; others are referred by their doctor or by social services. ""Isolating"" Dr James Brooke, a GP in Stevenage, says he refers clients for love addiction treatment about once a fortnight. He believes it is a genuine condition which needs to be taken seriously: ""Certainly I feel that love addiction is more commonplace than people think, and quite likely to be on a par with alcoholism, but the symptoms are much more subtle, so people tend to miss them."" Every year he sees three or four patients whose lives are turned around by treatment at the Living Room. Love addicts can recover and go on to have healthy relationships The centre was founded ten years ago by Janis Feely, who had struggled with addiction herself and wanted to help others. ""Its a very isolating illness and its not talked about"", she says. ""People just dont know it exists and theres many people in pain with love addiction."" Janis has won numerous awards for her work and was presented with an MBE earlier in the year. She says the treatment for love addiction is similar to that for other addictions: ""Its really about being abstinent from your drug of choice, which in this case is an unhealthy relationship. ""But unlike alcoholics who cant ever drink again, recovered love addicts can go on to have healthy relationships after a year or two."" Recovery After breaking for lunch, the clients of the love addiction group show each other examples of art and craftwork they have done to express their feelings and improve their self-esteem. One has decorated a plate with a detailed painting depicting her route to recovery from addiction. On other occasions, the afternoon activity takes the form of a workshop or video presentation exploring healthy relationships. They then discuss their experiences over the past week, and how they are putting what they have learned into practice. Laura has begun dating again, but says it has ""not been terribly successful"". She says she is having to learn the habits of healthy relationships for the first time: ""Somebody described it to me once as when youre so full up with love for yourself theres more to spare, thats the point at which you can get into a relationship.""

Election results 2017: How do you get over losing your job as an MP?,"How long does it take to get over the shock of losing your job as an MP? A year, two days?",,9 June 2017,BBC News,"Image caption Gemma Doyle lost what had once been seen as a safe seat in 2015 How long does it take to get over the shock of losing your job as an MP? A year, two days? Inevitably some MPs - such as former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and former SNP leader Alex Salmond - found themselves out of a job in the early hours of this morning - and it can be tough to take. A study by the Open University Business School didnt beat about the bush when summing up just how difficult it can be for some MPs to leave office. It included an anonymous quote from one former MP, who said: ""It was like a bereavement, and it was, but there was no funeral."" In the same study, Baroness Jowell, who stood down at the 2015 election after 23 years as the MP for Dulwich and West Norwood, explained why it can be such a terrible shock to the system. ""As an elected politician, you are always switched on and feel the responsibility for your electorate day and night. This is not easy to give up."" For some former ministers, the pain can be mitigated by trading in a high political profile for a high profile elsewhere. Former Chancellor George Osborne is now editor of the London Evening Standard, former shadow chancellor Ed Balls used a comedy turn on Strictly Come Dancing to raise his profile and transform the way he was viewed by the public. Michael Portillo emerged from a defeat in the 1997 election so famous that it became known as the ""Were you up for Portillo?"" moment, but reinvented himself as a cultured presenter of railway travelogue documentaries. Some people even revel in the their new-found freedom. Liberal Democrat Norman Baker, a minister in the 2010 coalition government, reformed his old band the - er - Reform Club, released new material and went on the road. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Norman Baker performs at Londons Piccadilly Circus A scathing review of a single in the Daily Telegraph - ""banal, obvious and utterly pedestrian"" - hasnt stopped him embracing a varied media life to the point where he told the Independent newspaper he had no intention of returning to front-line party politics. Others, like Labours Chris Williamson, who lost his seat in Derby in 2015 by 41 votes, immediately work to get back to Westminster as soon as possible. ""Im a Derby lad,"" he told the New Statesman, ""Youre elected to represent your city, and then you lose - I was in the depths of despair."" He duly won his seat back on Friday morning, with a majority of 2,015. Others, however, choose a different path. Jackie Ballard lost her seat at the 2001 general election after four years as the Lib Dem MP for Taunton, agonisingly falling short by just 235 votes. ""I was very disappointed as I knew I had been a good, hard-working MP and had a great team of helpers, who I felt I had let down,"" she said. Image caption Jackie Ballard during her time as Lib Dem home affairs spokeswoman ""I decided as soon as I knew the result (although it was about 05:00 in the morning, after a number of recounts) that I would not stand again. I felt rejected by the people in Taunton, where I had lived for many years, and didnt want to live there any longer."" It was a painful change of fortune for a woman who had stood for the leadership of her party just two years earlier. For a year she went away to lick her wounds on a ""gap year"", living and studying in Iran. But when she got back she found that her Westminster experience - even the tough times - held her in good stead when looking for an alternative career. As an MP some thought her outspoken opposition to blood sports, including co-sponsorship of the first bill to attempt to introduce a ban on fox hunting, had sealed her electoral fate. But her campaigning track record helped her to secure a plum job as director general of the RSPCA. Image copyright PA Image caption Nick Clegg lost the Sheffield seat he had held since 2005 Ms Ballard went on to hold senior roles with the RNID, and Womankind Worldwide, a relatively small but respected international womens rights charity, before becoming chief executive of Alcohol Concern in 2014. She was also appointed to the Independent Standards Authority, overseeing MPs expenses in 2009. ""I have loved working in the charity sector and feel that I have made a lasting contribution to a number of very worthwhile charities,"" she said. ""It was challenging to move into leadership and management, but I loved doing something worthwhile and where my Parliamentary experience was useful on the campaigning side. ""A key skill which is needed to get things done in Parliament and in charities is the ability to make alliances and work with others to achieve an outcome."" Gemma Doyle, one of the raft of Labour MPs in Scotland who lost their seat to the SNP in 2015, says she adjusted quickly to the new reality of life after Westminster. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Couldnt stay away: Chris Williamson has made a speedy return to Westminster after losing his seat in 2015 ""I spent about two days feeling sorry for myself, but fairly quickly moved on to accepting that there was nothing I could have done about the result, that it was the consequence of a principled stance we had taken on the Scottish referendum, and there was no point in dwelling on it,"" she said. ""The 2015 election result was quite unusual, I had lost in a constituency which, under normal circumstances, would have been a guaranteed safe seat. The swing against me, and my Scottish colleagues was massive. ""However, strange as it sounds, there is comfort in losing in such a spectacular way. If you lose by just a little, it must be difficult not to dwell on the things you could or should have done differently. If you lose the way most of us did in Scotland, theres just nothing that would have changed the result."" Ms Doyle is now a director at a public affairs firm, and also freelances in the sector. ""There is a myth that ex-MPs are given or helped to find new jobs. Thats not true, you are on your own, and theres no doubt that but for a few exceptions, its tough to work out what comes next, especially when you have just lost, what for me was my dream job. ""I worried I wouldnt end up doing something that felt like it mattered again, but I fell into freelancing, including consultancy in some strange bits of the world working to support emerging democracies, which I enjoy enormously. ""I feel hugely privileged to have been an MP. In the end if you stand for election you have to be prepared for defeat.

Alcohol limits advice 'confusing',"Using units to set out safe drinking levels is confusing, and guidance needs to be much simpler according to the head of a support charity.",,7 October 2011,BBC News,"Image caption People have little specific idea of how much they can drink The advice on alcohol limits is too confusing according to Debbie Bannigan, head of the charity Swanswell. She says that units mean nothing to many people - and the guidance should be clearer and easier to remember. In this weeks Scrubbing Up, she says that to have a daily ""safe"" amount is misleading and that some people - including pregnant women and drivers - should be told ""no alcohol is best"". Most people think they have a rough idea of ""how much is too much?"", but ask them for specifics and theyre not sure. Who can blame them, when the measure that is used to define safe limits - units - is so hard to understand? While 82% of adults claim to know what a unit of alcohol is, 77% dont know how many units are in a typical large glass of wine. Ironically, units become even harder to compute when weve had a drink, because the part of our brain that works that sort of thing out switches off. And the concept of a daily safe amount may even encourage the idea that we should drink alcohol every day. To add to the confusion, were bombarded with new ""scientific"" findings about alcohol. In the last couple of months alone, weve been told that alcohol damages the DNA of unborn children beyond repair, but that its OK for pregnant women to have a couple of glasses of wine a week, which is pretty conflicting advice. Reported health benefits from alcohol are rarely balanced with information about the risks, or the observation that the benefits can be achieved in other ways that dont carry any significant risks at all. Its little surprise that people are confused about the impact alcohol can have on their lives. But walk into any supermarket and youll be encouraged to buy alcohol. My local supermarkets ""seasonal aisle"" - one of the first things you see when you enter the store - has become a wine festival. And the end of each aisle - the ""impulse buy"" space - is also stacked with cans of lager and cider, so selecting and purchasing alcohol is just part of the weekly shop rather than something that we have to think about doing. Drink, anyone? The people who come to us for help are just like you and me, but theyve found that their choice to drink alcohol has been riskier than they expected. What can be done about it? Official guidelines could be clearer. Other public health messages are short and snappy, like clunk-click every trip or catch it bin it kill it. We shouldnt be afraid of setting clear guidelines and sticking to them They are designed to be simple and memorable, so we learn and apply them without trying. Units dont work this way, but a simple phrase like one or two, once or twice gives us a simple yardstick that drinking one or two alcoholic drinks, once or twice a week, is a good limit. Sometimes a clear, easy to understand and safe message is that no alcohol is best - for example, for children, in pregnancy or when driving. Scientific evidence shows that even one drink can impair judgement when driving and that alcohol affects children disproportionately, especially before they are born. A zero limit for drivers, pregnant women and children avoids confusion and helps us all to take responsibility. We shouldnt be afraid of setting clear guidelines and sticking to them. With co-operation between drinks manufacturers, supermarkets and the government we can judge the risk of alcohol use for ourselves. Not only can we reach the point where hospital admissions are going down instead of up, we can create a society that is free from problem alcohol use altogether.",{},"['safe', 'advice', 'simple', 'women', 'limits', 'guidelines', 'alcohol', 'units', 'idea', 'children', 'pregnant', 'confusing', 'drink']","Image caption People have little 'specific' idea of how much they can drinkThe advice on alcohol limits is too confusing according to Debbie Bannigan, head of the charity Swanswell.

Suffering from a rare nerve disease with no prospect of a cure, shes in constant pain. ""The pain is always there,"" she said. ""The nerves just keep firing off pain."" Not even the insertion of a spinal cord stimulator could combat the debilitating consequences of her condition. So Lori turned to medical marijuana for relief. It works, up to a point. ""It certainly doesnt take the pain away,"" she said, ""but it helps... relax you a little bit so that you are not concentrated so much on it.""

She picks up her medication at Denver Relief, one of more than 1,100 dispensaries now operating across the state. The dispensary, with its small, anonymous waiting area and ""bud room"" where patients make their selections from a wide array of marijuana products, is part of a wellness centre that also offers acupuncture, massage, yoga and counselling. In Colorado, taking marijuana for medical purposes is not just a choice, its a right. The state passed a constitutional amendment legalising its medical use in 2000. But only in the past two years have dispensaries mushroomed, as more and more people obtain state-issued medical marijuana certificates. Image caption The places that dispense the drug are in rows of ordinary shops One recent estimate suggested 80,000 Coloradans hold medical marijuana certificates, with new applications pouring in every day. At a medical marijuana trade fair in Denver last week, doctors offered cut-price consultations amid stalls advertising ""Mile High"" ice-cream and iPhone applications that can locate nearby dispensaries. To qualify for a certificate, patients must be diagnosed with one of eight conditions, from specific ailments like glaucoma to general complaints like ""severe pain"". Prohibition comparison ""Its a revolution,"" said Eryn Ruppell of advocacy magazine Post420, who was surveying the busy trade fair. ""Its really going to change history,"" she said. ""When I was [my kids] age, I was reading about the prohibition of alcohol. Theyre going to be reading about this movement."" The comparison with prohibition in the 1920s and 1930s is apt: during its 13 years, alcohol was frequently prescribed by doctors for its supposedly therapeutic qualities. Image caption Cannabis is on open sale to those with medical permission In 1933, the US Congress repealed the 18th amendment to the US constitution and alcohol consumption was once again a matter for states to regulate. Last March, in an echo of that move, US Attorney General Eric Holder called off federal raids on medical marijuana distributors that comply with state laws. Another similarity: Mr Holders move and the prohibition repeal occurred amid severe economic crises and involved industries capable of generating huge revenues. There is clearly plenty of money to be made regulating and taxing an industry worth as much as $36bn a year, a 2006 estimate that would make it Americas largest cash crop. Complex rules But the man in charge of drawing up Colorados regulatory framework says regulation is not merely an effort to raise tax revenue. ""There may be a perception this is a taxation issue,"" said Matt Cook, senior director of enforcement in Colorados Department of Revenue. WHERE IS CANNABIS ALLOWED? Netherlands has longstanding de facto decriminalisation has longstanding de facto decriminalisation Mexico decriminalised possession of small amounts last year decriminalised possession of small amounts last year Portugal allowed possession and use of small quantities in 2001 allowed possession and use of small quantities in 2001 Private use and cultivation is allowed in Spain Health authorities in Canada allow medical usage for certain patients allow medical usage for certain patients In the UK cannabis remains illegal ""It is not. This is about responding to the constitutional amendment... creating some very solid guidelines for the industry."" Mr Cook is developing a complex set of regulations covering every aspect of the trade, from labelling and health standards to video security and advertising.

Legal highs: A game of m-cat and mouse,,,2010-03-18 13:22:34,,"By Denise Winterman and Finlo Rohrer BBC News Magazine No sooner is one legal high banned than another appears. The latest facing calls for a bar is mephedrone, or m-cat. Its part of a war of attrition between dealers and the authorities. So how does it all work? SPOT THE DIFFERENCE - LEGAL V ILLEGAL COMPOUNDS Small structural changes to an illegal chemical can create a new legal compound Legal high dealers scour scientific literature for substances similar to recreational drugs These are then produced by legitimate chemical firms, typically in China Its a thriving market - and an increasingly worrying one for the government. Legal and herbal highs are nothing new, but ever stronger variants are emerging all the time and legal loopholes are being exploited to make them easily available. The death of Louis Wainwright, 18, and Nicholas Smith, 19, on Monday has raised concerns again. The two friends died after taking the legal stimulant mephedrone which is used as an alternative to ecstasy and cocaine. Their parents are now calling on the government to ban it. Under medicines legislation it is illegal to sell it for human consumption, but it is sold as a plant fertiliser and is available on the internet for as little as £4. Just the one-line warning ""not for human consumption"" covers suppliers legally. It is the latest in a string of legal highs to be scrutinised. Such substances mimic the effects of illegal drugs, but are not controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. They can be anything from herbal blends to synthetic chemicals. It is a very difficult area because as soon as one thing gets banned, then there are others that come on to the market Maryon Stewart Parents call for mephedrone ban Several were banned last year after they were linked to deaths. These included GBL, which was used as a substitute for banned drug GHB, and some synthetic cannabinoids - man-made chemicals sprayed on herbal smoking products -such as ""spice"". Theres a bewildering array of similarly named drugs with different legal statuses. M-cat is one of the street names for mephedrone, but it is also in use for the illegal substance methcathinone. Drugs in the UK are banned by the home secretary, with parliamentary backing. But the initial steps are usually taken by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which advises the government on drug-related issues. The ACMD is an independent expert body made up scientists, experts from the pharmaceutical industry, police and drug charities. Its job is to investigate a substance which is being ""misused or appears to be being misused"" and ""is having or appears to be capable of having harmful effects sufficient to cause a social problem"". That can be anything from legal highs to alcohol. In recent years it has suggested a ban on selling strong lagers and beers. The council can be asked to investigate a substance - by the government or the public - or do it off its own bat. Chemical listing It has often started gathering evidence on a specific drug before it has hit the headlines because it has such good contacts in the field, says Harry Shapiro of drugs advice charity DrugScope. Legal highs mimic the effects of illegal drugs ""The ACMDs members come from across the profession so its intelligence on substances and how they are being used is very good,"" he says. If the council favours a ban, it recommends this to the home secretary, who proposes an amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. This goes before parliament for approval and if voted through goes onto the statute books to become law. The ACMD is expected to report back to the government at the end of this month on mephedrone. Its a robust process, ""as it should be"", says Mr Shapiro. ""This is changing the law, not just issuing a public health warning. A knee-jerk response is not the answer."" Dr John Ramsey, head of drugs database unit TicTac Communications at St Georges University of London, agrees. ""Essentially the problem is in writing legislation which controls what you want to control without inadvertently controlling something you dont intend to. The pharmaceutical industry needs to be able to continue its business, the chemical business needs to be able to supply chemicals for legitimate use. ""Some countries have a list of chemicals that are banned which is fraught with problems. The British legislation has been somewhat generic. We have described the chemical structure of compounds rather than the names. It covers things that we currently know about or that we think might come about."" Designer/designed This approach has benefits in that it can cover drugs before they rise to prominence. Mephedrone is seen as an alternative to ecstasy ""Ecstasy was already controlled by the misuse of drugs act by the generic legislation although it wasnt named in the act,"" says Dr Ramsey. But for some campaigners, like Maryon Stewart, whose 21-year-old daughter Hester died after taking GBL, the process is long and cumbersome. ""It is a very difficult area because as soon as one thing gets banned, then there are others that come on to the market,"" she says. Most agree the rapid evolution of such ""designer drugs"" (or, more correctly ""designed drugs"") is a big problem. Although the term first rose to prominence in the 1980s, it may be more prevalent than ever, says Dr Ramsey. The core of the problem is that none of these drugs have been properly tested to see how toxic they are to humans. ""Quantitatively it has become much more significant. People are being much more innovative than they were - they are coming from leftfield."" In some cases legal high traders have consciously looked for a tiny variation to an existing compound. The ""beta keto"" family is one such case, says Dr Ramsey. ""They have looked at things like MDMA, MDEA and MBDB [all bracketed as ""ecstasy""], chemically modifying those to bring them outside control."" So you have chemicals used recreationally, and with some of the same effects as ecstasy, that are not illegal. They are sold openly in legal high shops. Made to order But there is no suggestion that there is a generation of brilliant bedroom chemists out there dedicated to finding legal highs. Instead, their job is done by legitimate chemists. This can be seen in the example of ""Spice"". A group of chemicals have been identified that are similar to the active ingredient in cannabis, THC. The friends had taken mephedrone ""Those have come about because somebody has looked at the pharmacology literature and found papers where these were investigated as potential analgesics, synthesised because they were like cannabis and discarded because they made people high,"" says Dr Ramsey. ""They read the appropriate literature, contact the Chinese chemical industry and say make me this. It needs a modicum of intelligence but not a great deal of pharmacological knowledge. These chemicals, for example 1-alkyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indoles, were created by a legitimate scientist and then hijacked by the legal high searchers."" And underlying all of it is the problem that many hijacked chemicals may currently or later have a valid use. But campaigners say the process for banning substances in the UK can be adjusted to stop the law always being behind the market. In New Zealand new drugs are put into a special category, where it is not illegal to sell or possess them but their effects are monitored. In Germany emergency regulations can be used to make a new, unregulated drug illegal for the first year, giving toxicologists the chance to investigate and decide whether it is dangerous or not. But no system is perfect, and even if it was the problems with legal highs wouldnt stop overnight, warns Mr Shapiro. ""The way we go about banning a drug in the UK does seem like a long process when there have been deaths, but just by making something illegal you dont just turn off the tap."" Below is a selection of your comments. Thank you so much for bringing this substance to the attention of the public. My son started using this substance and it completely changed his life. He became obnoxious, rude, aggressive and sold all his possessions. His so-called friends took him to the cleaners for sat navs, mobile phones, computers and let them use his car as well. We called the police and car back, trashed. He is getting over it but very long prison sentences and confiscation of the proceeds of crime is what is needed. Please get these substances made illegal. Brendon Flint, Ibstock It is misleading to say these two teenagers died after taking mephedrone. The TV report mentioned - in passing - that they had also taken the heroin substitute, methadone, and had been drinking alcohol (which is a contributing factor in many cocaine deaths). As the governments former drugs adviser Prof Nutt pointed out, there has been no evidence to say that mephedrone was to blame. What IS interesting, however, is the outcome of toxicology tests on a 46-year-old in Sussex on Thursday which found he DID die of ""mephedrone poisoning"". I can only assume, though, that although this is a more watertight story, this particular victim is too old to make the headlines. Roz, Gillingham, Kent I am a post-doctorate in medicinal chemistry and let me tell you that you will never be able to stop new analogues coming out. Through out university I used MDMA (ecstacy), but the market has become corrupted and dangerous substances such as pipperazines are sold as ecstasy. When you look at an ounce of crystal MDMA, there is a colour change through it - one side is clear, the other is darker implying impurities from catalysts and solvent used in synthesis. Hence regulation and making it illegal actually harms you by exposing people to dangerous contaminants - this has become particularly acute recently with the EU banning certain precursors used in MDMA synthesis, hence increasing the demand for alternatives (ie: m-cat). John Dalton, Cambridge I agree that this new batch of substances should be controlled because their misuse is spiralling out of control but what really needs answering is why people of all ages feel the need to get smashed on whatever stimulant they can lay their hand on? Wagonline, Loughborough It is futile trying to stop young people who are intent on getting high from getting substances, legal or not. The knee jerk reaction to a couple of deaths is to ban a substance, but another will rise up in its place. A far more pragmatic approach is required, for example allowing legal highs, but with researched doses, age limits and clearer guidance on the possible ill effects. After all, tobacco is still legal, and it has killed far more people than legal highs. Making these substances illegal will just drive people into the hands of drug dealers. John Clayton, Manchester, England I have a group of friends who take and sell mephadrone and a regular basis. Every week, they will stay awake from Tuesday or Wednesday right through to Sunday taking it and it can create a really hostile environment. After a couple days they get quite aggressive and short with everyone - including their friends - and people no longer enjoy being around them. You cant talk to them about it - with mephadrone being legal, they think that what they are doing is normal. Anonymous, Nottingham Its time for a complete rethink incorporating a changed view that people should be able to use drugs for a high BUT with the drugs being delivered though a controlled industry as is alcohol. So you pop into the chemist for a box of XXXdrone which have been produced in a controlled manner and have adequate safety instructions - after all even aspirin and paracetamol can kill in relatively small doses. If the news stories are to believed there are thousands of illegal drug users each weekend deaths are few but very sad - had the drugs been legal how many of those deaths would have been avoided bringing the overall deaths /thousand users down below that of other prescription medicines? Barrie Shepherd, Sydney, Australia This instinct to get high permeates the entire history of humankind (e.g. Egyptians and blue lotus flowers), so perhaps its time to admit that a legal and safe means to this effect needs instituting. Aldous Huxley wrote about the possibility of designed drugs as safer and less violence-inducing alternatives to alcohol back in the 1950s (amongst other possibilities), so now we have so many - lets just find the safest and legislate dosage/dispensation. Though I expect fear and intolerance will result in ever more banning, and in a few years well be reading about kids brewing embalming fluid with hair dye, or some other strange mix, in order to have their means to get high - and so dying in ever greater numbers. What a victory for common sense that will be. A Ward, Bath, UK Educate people! Please, for the love that you profess to have for them, teach them about cause and effect, because at the moment weve a country full of young people who have been blinkered and smothered who will take ANY opportunity to escape. Give people back their responsibilities to themselves and each other, stop this knee-jerk reaction to anything and everything and maybe we will find the real criminals will have to start looking for a proper job. Jon, London You have no idea. At uni there is an epidemic of people using this substance. Staying awake for up to five days just sniffing this stuff. More people WILL die. Matthew, Manchester Methadrone appeared shortly after one of the substances used to create MDMA (ecstasy) was recently cracked down on - saffrole. MDMA production has essentially halted in the UK since. The cause here is lack of MDMA, the affect being people turning to methadrone... a FAR MORE dangerous drug. There must be a much wider discussion on illegal drugs; millions upon millions of people use drugs everyday, clearly the ""war on drugs"" is failing. Better, like safe sex, to educate safe usage and let people decide for themselves. And tax it to pay for addiction issues and therapy. Might help bring the budget deficit down too. Tony, London If youre going to ban drugs that get people high, what Im wondering is why do they ban specific drugs. Why not have a list of conditions, and say any substance that causes any of these conditions when used is a drug is illegal? Andrew Morrison, Montreal, Canada I dont understand why there is talk of banning these chemicals. Mephedrone is a plant food and its not suitable for human consumption so you would have to be pretty daft to take it in the first place. Would these people drink bleach? Also, banning other drugs like cocaine, heroin etc have not stopped them from being used. Anyone who takes any sort of drugs should be aware of the side effects. Gillian, Glasgow The UK seems to take a more enlightened approach to drugs but still falls under the same pattern: banning. Many things will kill you, should they be illegal? My heart goes out to the parents and friends of people whove died while taking drugs. But denying someone else their right to do with their body what they please is unfair. My brother is NOT my keeper. Robert Vance, Grand Rapids, US Every day I cringed watching the news regarding ""legal highs"". There has already been other young adults die in different countries due to m-cat and those countries have banned it or made it controlled. Why do we always seem to be the last ones - do we have to wait until there are more deaths? It just makes me so angry. Lisa Lloyd, Barnsley So what does this tell us? Simple - prohibition of ancient drugs and plants has led to the creation of a whole new generation of designer drugs; which are generally much worse than the original ones for our nations health. Read the last section about the ""spice"" range of products. Would this have ever happened if cannabis was legally available in the way alcohol is? I havent seen any alcohol substitutes on sale. Dont get me wrong, I have seen the devastation that hard drugs cause. I have seen the awful effects of heroin on people who I knew when I was younger and it is not something I would ever want anyone to be stupid enough to get into. However, we have to be realistic. Prohibition of any drug has never been effective in preventing its use and has been proven to raise associated crime levels. The end result of decades of misinformation and misguided policy making is that the drug problem is now worse than ever. Forcing cannabis underground along with hard drugs has laid to alienation and mistrust between those growing up and the government. It has led to the creation of hideous chemicals - one of which took my nephews life at 23 - in an attempt to beat the laws. Legal or illegal, some people will always be foolish enough to take risks with their lives. Sensible attitudes and no criminalisation, however, gives the users, potential users and the health workers a chance to work together. It gives the educators the chance to address the subject without the ""us and them"" feeling which causes youngsters to trust the teachings of their peer groups and not the authorities. Stuart, Portsmouth The war on drugs is already lost and society has to be open to alternative ways of regulation. The governments own report Drug Classification: making a hash of it? clearly shows that the effects of alcohol and tobacco are far worse that the majority of illegal drugs; only you dont see news reports every night stating and naming another 100 people who have died today due to alcohol and tobacco. People are going to take drugs: fact. Banning everything that appears on the street just pushes people onto the next, an usually more dangerous, high. Its a zero sum game. Society is encouraged to be responsible drinkers (of the drug alcohol); could it be encouraged to be one of responsible drug takers?: Discuss. Richard, Notts Banning things is not the answer. Education is. Abusing drugs is idiotic and kids should be shown this, clearly and unequivocally. Caroline Brown, Rochester Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Saat itu dia bekerja sebagai staf di kantor pengacara Holland & Knight dan kantornya berada di lantai ke-23 gedung yang terpisah dari World Trade Center dipisahkan Church Street dan hotel Millennium Hilton. Pada pukul 08.46, dentuman besar mengguncang gedung. Seorang rekan kerja bertanya apakah ini petir lalu kemudian seseorang menjerit-jerit agar setiap orang keluar dari gedung karena sebuah pesawat menghantam menara kembar. Dengan harapan dapat melihat pesawat kecil menancap di pencakar langit terkenal, Van Why mengambil lift menuju lantai dasar dan keluar dari pintu berputar. ""Kejadiannya seperti dalam kisah Wizard of Oz, melangkah masuk ke dunia lain.

Dia menuturkan pagi itu dia berlari. Saat itu 09.50, 73 menit setelah pesawat pertama menabrak Menara Utara. Ketika dia tiba di apartemennya di 43rd Street, setelah secara sengaja menghindari kawasan seputar Empire State Building, hari sudah mendekati sore. Menara Utara juga ambruk namun Van Why cukup jauh untuk tidak mendengar suara rubuhnya gedung itu. Menjadi drama Seperti orang yang selamat dari peristiwa itu, Van Why mengikuti seorang terapis.

Kemudian emailnya dikirim lagi ke orang lain. Kemudian dia menerima pesan-pesan email yang menghargai ceritanya dari orang yang tak dikenalnya.

Ohio tension rises over Steubenville rape case,Students in an Ohio city where two high-school footballers are accused of rape are to have unarmed guards posted at their schools.,,9 January 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Steubenville is former steel town where the high school footballers are star names Students in an Ohio city where two high-school footballers are accused of rape are to have unarmed guards posted at their schools. The move comes amid tension in Steubenville, Ohio, ahead of a trial. A student seen online joking about the alleged rape of a teenage girl after an alcohol-soaked party regrets his comments, his lawyer has said. Potential witnesses have also come under pressure not to testify in Februarys trial, lawyers say. Trenton Mays and Malik Richmond, both 16, will face charges at a juvenile court in February. Their lawyers say they are innocent. The case has gripped the small city of Steubenville, a former steel town of some 18,000 people, with social media key to the spread of information. Ohio State University student Michael Nodianos is not a suspect in the case, but a video of him making disparaging comments about the alleged victim was posted on YouTube in August, taken down, and re-posted by hackers last week, his lawyer said. Speaking on Monday, Dennis McNamara said his client had ""made several very callous comments and is ashamed and embarrassed"" by them. ""He regrets those comments. He was not raised in that manner. I dont believe it was a crime to make the video, but it was stupid,"" Mr McNamara said, the Steubenville Herald-Star reported. In the 12-minute video, Mr Nodianos can be heard joking about the alleged rape, and at one point refers to the girl as looking ""dead"". He is reported to have left the university after receiving threats, and groups linked to hacking collective Anonymous have pledged to publish more videos. Social media evidence? Mr Nodianos video comments reportedly refer to the alleged rape of a 16-year-old girl on the night of 11 August 2012. She is said to have been attacked during a night of parties attended by members of the Steubenville High football team - which has an ardent following in the local area. Image caption The case has sparked anger and outrage in the town and online The two suspects, both star players on the team, were arrested on 22 August and then charged with rape and kidnapping, although the abduction charges were later dropped. They are currently under house arrest and their families say the boys are innocent. Hours after the incident took place, messages, videos, and photographs - including images of the alleged victim that have been described as compromising and explicit - were posted online and shared. The words ""rape"" and ""drunk girl"" were used in many of the posts. It has been suggested that she may have been urinated on. Police have said the girl had so much to drink that she is not able to remember much of what happened, and does not recall events that took place after midnight.

Investigators have also reportedly had difficulty retrieving deleted posts and photographs from phones and iPads seized by the authorities. They found two pictures of the 16-year-old, naked, but they do not show anyone involved in a sexual act with the girl, the New York Times reported. The case is raising tensions in the small Ohio city: on Tuesday guards were posted to school buildings after a threat was received that prompted a brief shutdown of the Steubenville public school network. Lawyers for potential witnesses also said this week that their clients were facing pressure not to testify at the trial, currently set for February. Threats On Monday, Mr Nodianos lawyer emphasised that his client was not present when the alleged rape took place. On the night of 11 August, Mr Nodianos was at a party in Steubenville that the alleged victim also attended, the lawyer said. Mr Nodianos saw the 16-year-old girl leaving the party with two boys in the early hours of 12 August, but was not present when the attack allegedly occurred. Mr McNamara also suggested the young man, who was in his first year at Ohio State University, had suspended his studies as a result of threats stemming from the video, according to reports. Meanwhile, the alleged victims mother said in interviews in December that her family had also received threats and extra police were patrolling their neighbourhood. A crime blogger who has posted extensively on the case has been sued by a member of the Steubenville High football team and his family for defamation. The blogger has also written about football culture in the town, and has blamed it for elevating the status of the high-school athletes and allowing exceptions for them.

"Shame drink-drivers, says Paralympian Simon Richardson","Paralympic cyclist Simon Richardson, who was badly hurt by a drunk motorist, backs the Christmas drink-driving campaign and urges naming and shaming.",,27 November 2012,BBC News,"Paralympic cyclist Simon Richardson has suggested naming and shaming drink-drivers as he backed the Wales Christmas clampdown. The 46-year-old Porthcawl rider spent nearly a month in hospital, still needs a wheelchair, and missed the London Paralympics after he was seriously injured by a drunk driver. He suggested putting the names of photos of those convicted on buses. The campaign features films made by young people with strong messages. Image caption Simon Richardson warned people about driving the morning after a night out I always believe drink-drivers should be named and shamed and their pictures should be on the backs of buses Simon Richardson, Paralympic cyclist Mr Richardson was injured when farmer Edward Adams, 60, of Cowbridge, ran into him on the A48 near Bridgend in August 2011. The cyclist won two gold medals and a silver at the Beijing Paralympics in 2008, but could not compete at this years London Games. Adams, who had been drinking the night before and told police had had had his first whisky at 6am on the morning of the accident, was jailed for 18 months last August. His trial heard that Adams had bad eyesight and should not have been driving anyway. Mr Richardson told BBC Wales at the drink-driving launch he did not think anybody went out to cause an accident, but some could be prevented. Giving the example of people who drove the night after drinking, he said: ""Youre still drunk the next day. [Accidents can be prevented] just by leaving it that extra couple of hours. Stronger message ""A drink-driver can always stop what they are doing."" He thinks a stronger message needs to be sent to those who drink-drive. I had never been so frightened and ashamed Woman convicted of drink-driving ""I always believe drink-drivers should be named and shamed and their pictures should be on the backs of buses,"" he said. The launch representing all four Wales police forces and Road Safety Wales looked at the case of a young driver who did exactly what Mr Richardson mentioned and drove the morning after drinking, not realising she was still over the limit. Actress Kirsty Jones gave a performance as an anonymous driver who drove into a barrier on the Llanedeyrn interchange on the A48 in Cardiff in May. The 22-year-old woman who had no previous convictions was breathalysed and found to have 71mg of alcohol per 100ml breath, or nearly twice the legal limit.

Merseyside milkman jailed for sexually abusing boys,A Merseyside milkman is jailed for sexually abusing boys who sometimes worked for him over a 29-year period.,,11 January 2011,BBC News,"A milkman who sexually abused boys over a period of three decades has been jailed for nine and a half years. David Sparks, 61, of Keswick Road, Wallasey, Merseyside, carried out a ""catalogue of sexual abuse"" on 10 boys, Liverpool Crown Court heard on Monday. He plied his victims with alcohol and showed them pornographic images before abusing them, the court was told. Sparks pleaded guilty to 20 child sex offences between 1972 and 2001 at an earlier hearing. The court was told that Sparks would initially carry out sexual acts in front of his victims, but over several months, he became more forceful and threatening before abusing them. Breach of trust Philip Astbury, prosecuting, said: ""The grooming behaviour of the defendant ordinarily involved an introduction to pornographic material, the giving of gifts or money and the provision of alcohol in return for sexual favours. ""Another recurring feature was his long-standing employment as a milkman. ""That enabled him to provide casual work to those who he sought to abuse, thereby winning their friendship and, on occasions, providing an excuse for boys to stay with him overnight."" One victim told how Sparks had abused him between 50 and 100 times and that it had become ""routine"". The court heard that Sparks abuse began in 1972 when, at the age of 23, he abused a 13-year-old boy. Jailing him, Judge David Harris QC said: ""Your offending behaviour was grave, highly damaging to your victims and disgraceful.""

PC Blakelock murder trial: Why did the latest case fail?,Why justice continues to evade PC Keith Blakelock's family 30 years after he was killed in the Broadwater Farm riots.,,9 April 2014,BBC News,"Another trial has ended with no-one convicted over the brutal murder of PC Keith Blakelock in the Broadwater Farm riots in north London almost 30 years ago. So why did the latest attempt fail? Image copyright Met Police Image caption PC Keith Blakelock was murdered as he tried to protect firefighters The family of PC Keith Blakelock have been trying to seek justice which has eluded them since 6 October 1985 when he was so savagely cut down in Tottenham. Beaten back by young men wielding an array of weapons, PC Blakelock fell and was attacked and sustained multiple injuries which proved fatal. He was stabbed 43 times. The riots were an unmitigated policing disaster. They failed to act on intelligence, conduct inquiries within the rules, deploy officers appropriately, protect their own officers from serious harm and to secure the crime scene. They were also an unmitigated catastrophe for the residents of Tottenham. It led to the stigmatising of more than 300 families as their young men were sent to custody or acquired criminal records for their part in the riots. It is this that has meant to this day the community remains traumatised and is still desperately seeking to overcome the mark that hangs over this part of north London. Inconsistent witness The trial has been a long and arduous one for all involved. In the absence of any forensic evidence against 45-year-old Nicky Jacobs, a successful prosecution was always going to be a challenge. Firstly it was not broadly fresh evidence. Two anonymous witnesses using the pseudonyms of ""John Brown"" and ""Rhodes Levin"" had previously not been seen as credible witnesses to mount a successful prosecution. Both men were adults when they themselves were involved in the attack on PC Blakelock, while Mr Jacobs was a juvenile. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The police carried out mass arrests after the riots During the second investigation into the murder that concluded in 1994, these men were offered immunity from prosecution on the grounds they admitted kicking PC Blakelock whereas they claimed Mr Jacobs had stabbed him. A third witness, a cousin of Mr Brown and known as ""Q"", was identified in 2009. He came to the Old Bailey and spun a yarn of what he saw which at times was fantastical. He suggested he had seen two Rolls Royces on the estate the day before the riots - one silver and one gold - where black men had passed what looked like sawn-off shotguns from one Rolls to the other. But he placed the murder scene on another part of the estate. His testimony sometimes mirrored that of his relative, although bizarrely he denied Mr Brown was his cousin. Image copyright The Monitoring Group Image caption The prosecution said Nicholas Jacobs had stabbed PC Blakelock as he was on the ground Q was often incoherent and had serious lapses of memory. He has a long history of alcohol and drug abuse, which at times, listening to his evidence seemed to have impaired his rational bearing. He was a man who sounded like someone 20 years older or one who is seriously ill. Police investigations The first one was held after the murder where three men were found guilty Their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991 In 1992-93, a second investigation was launched, but police struggled to get witness accounts because people did not want to make themselves liable to prosecution The police and CPS decided to pursue those who they believed had weapons as suspects and regard unarmed attackers who punched and kicked as witnesses The case was reopened in 2000 following a review of unsolved murders His certainty on one fact alone, that Mr Jacobs was guilty, defied the uncertainty and inconsistency on a whole raft of other facts. He was also evidentially inconsistent with other key witnesses to the crime, in particular the police officers. A very inconsistent fresh witness he turned out to be. The fourth strand of evidence was a poem written by Mr Jacobs in 1988 while he was serving a sentence for affray arising out of the riots. In it he appeared to admit his involvement in the crime but perhaps this was too ambiguous. It could have been the rantings of a mixed-up deluded young man who had clearly chosen the wrong path in life. An attempt at boasting, making himself bigger than he was perhaps? The final evidence presented by the prosecution was a brief exchange of words with an arresting officer when Mr Jacobs was suspected of being involved in a burglary in 2000. He was alleged to have said ""you dont want to mess with me I did Keith Blakelock"". Nevertheless, the officer failed to report this conversation to a senior officer at the time and only provided a statement 12 years after the event. Was this too inconclusive for the jury perhaps? Image copyright Met Police Image caption He was killed during a riot on the Broadwater Farm Estate Image copyright Reuters Image caption His family have had to go through numerous trials and hearings but as yet no-one is in jail for his murder Listening to the evidence there was always a strong possibility that there would be some reasonable doubt with all or some of these evidential strands. I suspect little or any of this will assuage or bring comfort to PC Blakelocks widow Elizabeth or his three sons Mark, Kevin and Lee. The harsh reality is people will only be convicted on sound evidence and this jury - which often asked penetrating questions whilst they were hearing the evidence - was not convinced it was. We must never forget this terrible deed, but we must also never forget the circumstances which led to it - a serious injury to mother Cherry Groce in Brixton which left her paralysed and then the death of Cynthia Jarrett when police, against their own rules, entered her home without warning. Image copyright PA Image caption Protests have been held outside the court supporting the defendant The Met Police only ""privately"" apologised for the former serious injury in March this year. It has never apologised to the Jarrett family. I was there that fateful night of the riots as I helped pull my future brother-in-law out from the midst of the conflagration. There have surely been great strides made since then in building relations between police and community. But the local borough commander in Haringey, Ch Supt Victor Olisa, told me ""more still needs to be done to engage and maintain a constructive dialogue with the local community"". The media also has a responsibility to help remove the stigma from a community that current residents say no longer deserves it. As for those that did murder PC Keith Blakelock, they must live with their conscience and before they meet their maker, they will have to reckon with what was on any scale an unjustified act of evil.",{},"['men', 'caption', 'image', 'case', 'fail', 'latest', 'jacobs', 'blakelock', 'trial', 'evidence', 'mr', 'murder', 'pc', 'copyright']","Another trial has ended with no-one convicted over the brutal murder of PC Keith Blakelock in the Broadwater Farm riots in north London almost 30 years ago.

Alex Salmond pledge to fight 'bigotry and booze',"Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond lays out his government vision with pledges for a ""social contract"" with the people and to fight ""bigotry and booze"".",,27 May 2011,BBC News,"Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has laid out his five-year vision for government, with a pledge to tackle ""bigotry and booze"". Following the SNPs landslide election victory, Mr Salmond has made new laws on tackling sectarianism and minimum alcohol pricing a priority. He also outlined a ""social wage"" with the people of Scotland. Mr Salmond pledged to retain vital services in return for measures like public sector pay restraint. The Scottish governments detailed programme for government, including a list of planned bills, will come after the summer break. Opposition parties urged Mr Salmond to clarify plans for his independence referendum, planned for the second half of the five-year parliament. Speaking at Holyrood, the first minister laid out plans for economic recovery and pledged to put a ""jobs agenda"" at the heart of his programme for government. In the next few weeks, the Scottish Parliament is expected to pass new laws on increasing jail terms for sectarian-related disorder to a maximum of five years. And ministers will also bring back plans to set a minimum price per unit of alcohol - proposals which were defeated in the last parliament when the SNP was in minority government. Analysis Much from Mr Salmond about a ""social wage"". It is a phrase commonly distrusted by the right, in that they argue it can involve enhanced state control and hand-outs, rather than any form of earned entitlement or ""wage"". On this occasion, Mr Salmond placed it in a specific context - and with a specific contrast. The context was public spending constraint - and particularly the wage freeze being endured by many in the public sector. To alleviate such difficulties, Mr Salmond argued, it was vital to provide continuing compensation in the form of public benefits - such as free personal care, free prescriptions, free travel. A counter case could be made by some that such universality of provision benefits the relatively well off more than the poor - in that the low-waged might expect such benefits in any case under a targeted system. To contest such arguments, Mr Salmond turned to a contrast: that between the approach he plans in Scotland and his vision of what is happening south of the border. His vision, of course, would be disdained as a caricature by those in government at Westminster. More from Brian Taylor The first minister told MSPs: ""In the age of Twitter and texts, the dreams of a free-speaking world are contaminated by viral strains of bitterness. ""Technology has given fresh energy to old hatreds and pustulant sectarianism again seeps across our land. ""Well, it will be stopped - I will not have people living in fear from some idiotic 17th Century rivalry in the 21st Century."" Mr Salmond said sectarianism ""must stop"", adding: ""Not because it is embarrassing to our national image - though it is. ""Nor that it is embarrassing to ourselves - though it is that too - but because it is a pointless cause pursued by the pitiless."" Turning to Scotlands ""booze culture"", Mr Salmond went on: ""I think that we have confused our appetite for fun with a hunger for self-destruction. ""We tolerate a race to the bottom of the bottle, which ruins our health, our judgement, our relationships, our safety and our dignity. ""Thus, early legislation in this parliament shall address both bigotry and booze."" Mr Salmond said his government had committed to helping hard-pressed Scots by freezing the council tax over the course of the five-year parliament and moving against public sector compulsory redundancies. The SNP has also committed to keeping prescription charges and bridge tolls free, while maintaining free bus travel for the elderly and protecting NHS spending. Defining the social wage as a ""pact"" between politicians, public services and the people, the first minister said: ""We shall deliver the social and economic circumstances that allow for people to dream, to aspire and to be ambitious - but it is for the individual to realise their dreams, to reach for their hopes, to meet their ambitions. ""People understand that public spending must be restrained, and, in return, we will stand alongside the family in Dumfries that wants to send their daughter to university. I think (Scotland) is big enough, rich enough in talent and certainly smart, creative and educated enough to take every opportunity being part of a bigger social and economic unit affords it Iain Gray, Scottish Labour leader ""We will support the commuter in Dunfermline who travels daily across the Forth or the family in Ayrshire who would otherwise have to choose which medicine they can afford this month. ""And we will protect the pensioner in Inverness who lives off her savings and fears ever-rising prices and bills."" Mr Salmond said the SNPs planned Scottish Futures Fund would tackle ""endemic problems"" with support for young people, transport, housing and new, digital technology. And the government would also prioritise the ""internationalisation"" of Scotlands economy, in areas such as renewable energy. Hitting out at the UK government, Mr Salmond said: ""Elsewhere on these isles, the tolerance of the poor is being tested - budgets slashed, priorities changed, hope crushed in the braying tones of people who claim to know best. ""We should aspire to be different. In Scotland the poor wont be made to pick up the bill for the rich."" Mr Salmond again called for Westminster to devolve control over increased borrowing powers, corporation tax, excise duties, control over the Crown Estate, broadcasting and increased influence in Europe. And, turning to the referendum, Mr Salmond told MSPs: ""The age of benign dictat is over. ""This parliament is not a lobby group, begging Westminster for what is already ours. This parliament speaks for the people of Scotland and they shall be heard."" Outgoing Labour leader Iain Gray called on the first minister to make his referendum plans clear at the earliest opportunity, saying the issue was creating uncertainty over Scotlands economic future. Claims absurd Mr Gray said of Scotland: ""I think it is big enough, rich enough in talent and certainly smart, creative and educated enough to take every opportunity being part of a bigger social and economic unit affords it."" Tory leader Annabel Goldie, who is also standing down from her role, said she was proud to be both Scottish and British - but argued it was not possible to be for both independence and extended devolution within Britain. She said the Scotland Bill on more powers for Holyrood, currently going through Westminster, was ""the way ahead"". ""Alex Salmonds is not the only mandate,"" said Miss Goldie, adding: ""Scotland by referendum has voted for a devolved Scottish Parliament with tax varying powers - that is the settled will."" On SNP demands for more powers, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""I think it is only fair for him to set out for us the full list of things he is claiming a mandate for. ""At its heart, the revised claims from the SNP for a revised mandate are absurd. ""They are solemnly promising to spend the first two years of the parliament working on the Scotland Bill when they confidently expect to spend the last two years abolishing it."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said his party was prepared to work with the Scottish government on supporting the economy. But he called on Mr Salmond to say on which issues he was claiming a mandate. ""At its heart, the revised claims from the SNP for a revised mandate are absurd,"" said Mr Rennie. ""They are solemnly promising to spend the first two years of the parliament working on the Scotland Bill when they confidently expect to spend the last two years abolishing it.""",{},"['pledge', 'scottish', 'scotland', 'snp', 'bigotry', 'plans', 'salmond', 'mr', 'parliament', 'public', 'alex', 'fight', 'booze', 'wage', 'social']","Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has laid out his five-year vision for government, with a pledge to tackle ""bigotry and booze"".

Silent danger: Living with a secret addiction,Why so many people suffer addictions in secret,,28 January 2014,BBC News,"Image copyright Thinkstock ""I thought I was hurting myself and my family and felt it was better to take my own life rather than endure this any more."" That is how a French academic, currently living and working in Northern Ireland, explained the burden of living with a secret addiction. He became dependent on prescription drugs without even being aware of it. Alex Bunting, head of Corporate Services at FASA (Forum for Action on Substance Abuse) in Northern Ireland, said that such experiences are not uncommon: ""The whole stigma attached to substance misuse still exists and that is a key element in people remaining silent regarding their addictions. ""For all the positive work we see on high-profile TV campaigns about removing the stigma of alcohol and substance addiction, we have many people coming in to FASA who dont want to tell anyone about their addiction."" FASA, the subject of a BBC Northern Ireland series Watch Over Me, was the first community-based charity in Northern Ireland to offer support for substance abuse, suicide, self-harm and mental health under one roof. Stevie Millar, a youth engagement worker with the charity, said that there were a number of reasons for people wishing to not tell anyone about their addictions. ""In my experience, people can be concerned that knowledge of their addiction could put their job in jeopardy. Others are concerned about the effect it will have on their relationship or that it could break up their family,"" he said. ""When people hide their addictions from loved ones, they can also at times be trying to convince themselves they dont have a problem."" Journey to addiction Such secret addictions can emerge for a variety of reasons. Our anonymous source explained why he doesnt want people to know about his addiction: ""There are many people who may feel they wouldnt like an addict to be teaching their kids."" So how did he reach such a low point in his life? ""In 2010 my mother was diagnosed with cancer and my father was also unwell. Returning to France temporarily to care for my parents, and feeling under a lot of pressure, I went to see a GP, who prescribed me benzodiazepines."" Benzodiazepines include diazepam and temazepam, and are prescribed for a range of conditions such as anxiety and insomnia. What are benzodiazepines? Benzodiazepines act by enhancing the effect of a brain chemical transmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which depresses or calms the central nervous system, slowing down mental activity to cause relaxation and sedation. Life addicted to prescription drugs He said he could not have foreseen the difficulty of the journey he was about to embark on. ""My doctor in France didnt explain that there could be an issue with dependency on the benzodiazepines. After several months I stopped taking them, but a couple of weeks later I became very sick and suffered physical and mental problems as a result of not taking the medication."" His father eventually died and, struggling to cope, he was put on a further course of benzodiazepines. ""I was also taking anti-acid tablets. When I stopped taking all my medication it was like a mini-nuclear explosion in my head. ""I lost over two stones in weight. It all led to a mental and physical collapse. I couldnt see a way out and thought I was useless and that I would never work again. That is when I considered suicide."" ""There are many people who may feel they wouldnt like an addict to be teaching their kids. At this point he began to seek help and was eventually led to FASA. He is unequivocal about the importance of the role FASA played in his recovery: ""When youre going through all that, you feel alone and that you dont want to burden your family. ""You need someone who will listen and will help you. I wouldnt be here now without FASA, they helped me piece my life back together and kept my family together. There isnt a pill for every problem."" He went through a drug reduction course and received counselling and acupuncture, all of which he found extremely helpful. For him, the future is now positive. ""For two years I wasnt myself. But Im 80, 90% back to my old self now. FASA helped me continue with my work and Im very lucky it didnt destroy my family,"" he said. Withdrawal symptoms He only realised he had a dependence on medication when he initially stopped taking it. Possible withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines In a 2011 interview with BBC News, Prof Malcolm Lader of the Institute of Psychiatry explained why people can find it so difficult coming off benzodiazepines. ""I estimate about 20-30% of people who are on benzodiazepines have problems coming off, and about a third have very distressing symptoms. The anxiety or sleeplessness comes back and they feel physically ill."" ""I felt like someone was drilling my stomach. I suffered vertigo and anxiety. I thought I was maybe going mad or that I had cancer or an ulcer with all my stomach problems."" FASAs Alex Bunting said that it is common for people to be unaware they have an addiction. ""Often the person doesnt realise they have a problem until it creeps up on them and impacts their life,"" he said. Mr Bunting highlighted some symptoms that may act as possible indicators of an addiction: ""Someone may experience irritability, paranoia and anxiety when not taking the medication or substance. I would encourage anyone in that position to seek help."" He said that long-term prescriptions can be dangerous. ""In the case of co-codamol, codeine converts to morphine in the liver and so a lot of people become addicted to morphine,"" he said. Image copyright Science Image caption A GP writing a prescription ""People can have developed a dependency without realising it, for example, an older person who has been on codeine for seven years because of a bad hip."" Mr Bunting is very concerned by the number of people on this type of medication. ""At FASA, misuse of prescription medication is the second biggest issue we deal with after alcohol abuse. Its important to guard against the perception there is a pharmaceutical answer to lifestyle issues. While medication can be very useful, it isnt always the answer."" British Medical Association Dr Alan Stout, deputy chair of the BMA (British Medical Association) NI GP Committee, has seen how helpful a role medication can play in tackling issues such as depression and anxiety but acknowledges other solutions are often required. ""Northern Ireland is facing an epidemic of unhappiness at the moment, and there is a challenge to developing community services including counselling further,"" he said. Dr Stout said many precautionary steps are taken around prescribing medication. ""A number of medications are well known to be addictive, benzodiazepines are a good example,"" he said. ""GPs try to reduce their use and prescribing and limit the number issued to patients. This is evidenced by the reduction in the number prescribed over the past number of years. Image caption FASA worker James Scott (left) records the evidence of some drug packaging ""If a patient is started on them, they will be given a short supply and a review arranged to ensure they do not become dependent on them. It is much rarer now to initiate these drugs, but some are still recommended through hospital clinics."" Dr Stout believes the use of medications that have not been prescribed by the GP and have been obtained illegally is a huge challenge facing society. ""Quite often this is not known to the GP. These are often the cases that become a crisis,"" he said. Hidden harm Alex Bunting said it is important to remember that an addiction can have far-reaching consequences, with hidden harm a significant concern. ""The stigma from the addiction filters out and it can affect many people within families, with children at times being deeply impacted by being exposed to a parents addiction,"" he said. ""An addiction can also have as much or more impact on the carer than the person themselves."" FASA is keen to highlight that substance abuse, mental health issues and suicide know no boundaries in terms of class, age or gender. So what advice does FASA offer people suffering addictions in secret? Stevie Millar, while understanding people can at times feel vulnerable if their addiction is widely knows, considers it vital to speak to someone. ""Being open and honest is not only very important for the person to build support in FASA, but its important for them to build support on the outside. So its vital to have that support for people to be able to express how they are feeling.""

"Many hospitals not sharing crime data, audit shows","A coalition pledge to make hospitals share violent crime data with police is being carried out in only a third of areas in England, an audit shows.",,31 January 2013,BBC News,"Image caption Similar schemes have seen a fall in incidents of violent crime A coalition pledge to make hospitals share violent crime data with police is being carried out in only a third of areas in England, an audit shows. The government has written to hospitals and chief constables for an explanation after the Department of Health audit. Accident and emergency departments are meant to share information about where knife or gun attacks are happening with the police and local council. This was part of the governments programme for government in 2010. Disappointed In 2010 the coalition promised in its programme for government to make hospitals share non-confidential information with the police so crime hotspots could be identified. I would want to say to hospitals and local authorities this is straightforward, ethical information-sharing that makes for safer communities - just get on with it Prof Jonathan Shepherd, Cardiff University In the governments mid term report, which measured progress against their programme for government they said ""we have established a national scheme requiring hospitals to share information on gun and knife crime"". But an audit carried out for the Department of Health has revealed that is happening effectively in only a third of community safety partnership areas, and not at all in one-fifth. The charity Victim Support said it was very disappointing that the plan was not being implemented. Susannah Hancock, its assistant chief executive, said: ""The NHS is the second most likely public service after the police to come into contact with victims of violent crime, many of whom will not have reported such incidents to the police at all. "" It is thought that police are aware of fewer than a third of assaults that lead to the victim being treated in hospital. Pioneering research carried out in Cardiff tested the idea of regularly sharing collated information about the type and location of attacks, with all confidential patient information removed. As a result, the city saw a 35% fall in the numbers of assault victims turning up at A&E for treatment between 2000 and 2005. Professor Jonathan Shepherd, from Cardiff University, said the research showed sharing information costs little, and saves money in the longer term for the NHS and the criminal justice system. He said the findings of the audit were surprising, giving the strong evidence, and the commitment from government. ""I feel disappointed that it hasnt been taken up faster than this, and I would want to say to hospitals and local authorities this is straightforward, ethical information-sharing that makes for safer communities - just get on with it."" Win-win Arrowe Park hospital, in the Wirral, has seen some impressive results from setting up systems to share information every month with the police and local council. Anyone arriving at A&E with an injury caused by a violent assault is taken through a standard set of questions about the location and circumstances of the attack. The information has all patient data removed from it before it is shared. Between 2004 and 2010, the number of alcohol-related assault victims arriving for treatment fell by 30%. Chris Oliver, from the Wirral University Hospital Trust, said the results had convinced busy staff in A&E to get involved: ""Its owned by everyone within the department. The reception staff are very proactive when going through the questions. Its very rewarding for our staff to see the reduction in people coming into the department. Its a win-win."" The Department of Health said Health Minister Anna Soubry had written this week to all hospital chief executives and chief constables in England to remind them of the governments commitment on sharing information. The letter says there are no legal reasons for not sharing anonymous information, and asks for any ""good reasons why it cannot be done"" in areas which have failed to put systems in place. Despite this slow progress in implementing the approach in England, the idea has attracted international interest and there are pilot schemes under way in other countries.",{},"['crime', 'share', 'hospitals', 'violent', 'local', 'information', 'department', 'sharing', 'chief', 'shows', 'data', 'audit', 'health', 'victims']","Image caption Similar schemes have seen a fall in incidents of violent crimeA coalition pledge to make hospitals share violent crime data with police is being carried out in only a third of areas in England, an audit shows.

The Times reports that maintaining the police operation since June 2012, when Mr Assange first entered the embassy having failed to persuade the UK Supreme Court to block his extradition, has cost the Met £12.6m. The force will now focus on ""covert surveillance"", the paper says. The Daily Telegraph says Scotland Yard ""has admitted it cannot guarantee"" the arrest of Mr Assange should he step out of the embassys front door. Mr Assanges lawyers, the paper adds, ""have claimed that if he was sent to Sweden he would subsequently be at risk of being extradited to the US, where he believes he would face persecution for Wikileaks disclosures of sensitive information"". The Daily Mail poses the question ""what happens next?"" While three of the four Swedish sexual assault allegations he originally faced when he fled to the embassy have expired after reaching their five-year limit for prosecution, he faces one allegation of rape. However, that too will expire in 2020, and the Mail says Mr Assange is ""considering sitting out the remaining years as well"". Ecuadorian officials ""reportedly considered smuggling [Mr] Assange out of the embassy by disguising him in fancy dress, allowing him to hop across the Kensington rooftops to a helipad, or become lost in the crowds in Harrods"", reports the Guardian, citing Buzzfeed UK. Eye-catching headlines ""Sweeter beers for generation brought up on sugary drinks"" is the troubling headline for any beernoisseur in the Daily Telegraph. In a troubling throwback to the alcopops ""revolution"" of the 1990s, analysis for the Grocer magazine finds the market share of sweet-tasting alcoholic drinks has risen 50% in the past decade. ""Drinkers new to alcohol with sweeter palates are opting for mojito or guarana beers"", says the Telegraph. This is enough to drive your paper reviewer to drink. ""Were too tired, say French elite police"". The Times reports French officers responsible for protecting the countrys politicians ""are so tired they risk shooting a VIP by mistake"". While the police are banned from going on strike, the officers are suing the government because ""overwork was undermining their concentration and causing accidents"". Officers have accumulated 1.3 million hours of overtime as well, for which they have not been paid.

The Sun says Labour has been ""plunged into chaos"" and anonymous ""insiders"" have told the paper Mr McDonnell ""may not have clearly understood what he was committing Labour to"". However, the shadow chancellor has said signing up to the budget charter ""could restrict a future Labour government from borrowing to invest in national infrastructure"".

The Daily Mail says Labours change of heart is ""a serious blow"" to its ""remaining credibility"" and quotes Chancellor George Osborne as saying the oppositions policy ""has lurched from chaos to incredibility"". Writing in the Independent, Labour MP Chuka Umunna - a member of the shadow cabinet before Jeremy Corbyn won the party leadership - accuses Mr Osborne of staging a ""political stunt"" by launching the budget charter, saying he had branded previous attempts to force governments to run budget surpluses as ""vacuous and irrelevant"".

This ""could perhaps indicate plans for wild debauchery, but could equally betray the natural concern of men in their eighth decade who wish to dress properly for dinner"".

Fleet Street cannot get enough of the craze which means there are numerous headlines based on variations of ""hover"" and ""bovver"". Its an announcement about the legality of using hoverboards (or ""self-balancing scooters"", or swegways) that has brought them to the attention of the daily press. ""Using a hoverboard on a pavement is illegal"", says the Daily Mail, while the Daily Telegraph believes ""the 180-year-old Highways Act"" could stop the craze in its tracks. The Sun adds that they should only be used on private land.

Her only issue was coming to a stop: ""I froze with the same panic of stopping oneself from a fall and the board stopped too. This was a revelation."" The Guardian dedicates part of its leader column to the ""self-balancing platforms with wheels at each end"", asking why anyone would want one? ""They dont actually hover. They are not the enchanting air surfboards that Back to the Future promised us... it is anarchic in an infantile way"", says the paper, before declaring owners of swegways are ""making a statement that they are rich enough or lucky enough not to have grown up"".

Why do only some people get blackout drunk?,"Even when drinking the same amount as others, only some people experience blackouts. But blacking out can predict other problems down the line.",Melissa Hogenboom,2018-06-13 00:00:00,,"This story is featured in BBC Future’s “Best of 2018” collection. Discover more of our picks. It was another regrettably familiar wake-up for Sarah Hepola. Much of her memory from the previous night was blank. She remembers talking to people at a party, but then after that a shadow drops over her memories. How did she get there, where was the stamp on her hand from? Who bought the pizza? Who was the man beside her? “I was like, well that’s weird, I don’t know what happened… I just kind of laughed it off, it just seemed normal to me,” she recalls. This sort of memory loss happened time and again to Hepola – and from a very early age. It often felt like “a trap door had opened underneath me… I would wake up the next day and I would be in a different place,” she says. She was experiencing alcohol-fuelled blackouts – a colloquial term with potentially serious consequences. As the word suggests, in this state all memories of the night turn dark after a point. Some drinkers experience less severe, fragmentary blackouts where only pieces of memory are lost. Hepola’s regular blackouts didn’t ring alarm bells for her at the time. It was only looking back that she realised she had a “messed up” relationship with alcohol, experiences she has written about in a book. You might also like: • Beer or wine – which is better? • Why do the British drink so much? • Why are we so scared of chemicals? If this type of amnesia after drinking alcohol sounds familiar, that’s because blackouts are surprisingly common: one analysis suggests that over half of university-aged drinkers have experienced some level of blackout when asked about their drinking habits, while a survey of more than 2,000 adolescents recently out of secondary school found that 20% had experienced a blackout in the previous six months. “Fifteen years ago, the field didn’t accept these were common phenomenon,” says Aaron White of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in the US, who spends most of his career studying blackout drunkenness. “Now we are all aware that [many] people blackout.” Scientists are now revealing more about why blackouts occur and why it affects some more than others – helping them to better understand and hopefully prevent the many negative consequences. Until recent studies showed otherwise, for many decades it was believed that only alcoholics reached the state of being blackout drunk. A bizarre series of experiments – which never would be ethically approved today – revealed some startling insights. In the late 1960s, a researcher called Donald Goodwin recruited alcoholics in hospitals and job centres to identify what happens when a drunken memory disappears. When they answered, he told them that the pan had dead mice inside He found that out of 100 alcoholics, more than 60 experienced regular blackouts, some total and some fragmentary. He also revealed that individuals experiencing a blackout can act in a remarkably coherent manner. For instance, he showed that during intoxication subjects revealed “no impairment” of immediate memory and even were able to perform simple calculations. But 30 minutes later, these events were forgotten. In follow-up experiments, he plied alcoholics with whiskey (up to 18oz – or half a litre – in four hours) and presented them with situations that were set up to “provide memorable experiences, which sober persons have no difficulty remembering”. In one he showed participants pornography, then asked detailed questions about what they had seen. In another, with a frying pan in hand, he asked individuals if they were hungry. When they answered, he told them that the pan had dead mice inside. The drunk subjects had forgotten these memories after 30 minutes and could still not recall the events the following day. They could, though, recall these events up to two minutes later, revealing that their short-term memory was working. Though these experiments were performed with alcoholics, they set the stage for understanding how even non-alcoholics act during a blackout. They remain influential in part because today – for obvious ethical reasons – scientists cannot ply participants with alcohol to induce memory loss. They must largely rely largely on questionnaires of past events instead. It’s like a temporary gap in the tape That chunks of memory are completely lost during a blackout goes some way into revealing what is going on in the brain. It’s believed that the hippocampus is momentarily impaired – this is the structure of the brain important for weaving together incoming information to create our memories of everyday events. People with severe damage to this area cannot create new memories. Alcohol therefore shuts off brain circuits central to making episodic memories (memories of specific times and places), explains White, who has studied the process on a cellular level with rodent brains. “We think a big part of what’s happening is that alcohol is suppressing the hippocampus, and it’s unable to create this running record of events,” he says. “It’s like a temporary gap in the tape.” In rats, White showed that there are doses of alcohol where brain cells “still kind of work”, and higher doses where they are completely off – which explains partial blackouts where only fragments are lost. At the same time, two other important brain areas that feed the hippocampus information about what’s happening in the world are also suppressed when we drink alcohol, explains White. These are the frontal lobe, the reasoning area of the brain that we use when we’re paying attention to something, and the amygdala, the area that warns us about danger. Risk factors We now also know more about other factors that influence blackouts, such as drinking on an empty stomach or when sleep deprived. Another major risk has to do with how fast alcohol is consumed, as the quicker we gulp the faster our blood alcohol level spikes. A blood alcohol level of between 0.20 to 0.30 percent seems to be able to induce a total blackout, where nothing is remembered. That level could be reached by having 15 or more standard UK drinks over four hours, depending on sex and body weight. But blood alcohol levels do not explain why only some people lose whole chunks of their memory while others who drink similar amounts don’t. A 2016 study led by Ralph Hingson, also of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, provided some answers. “The frequency with which people reported bingeing and being drunk in the past month played a role, as did whether they smoke and took more than one psychoactive drug,” he says. Blackouts are more common in people with lower body weights. They’re also more common among university students, who are known to ‘pre-game’ to get “a buzz on before they start to socialise, and that makes your blood alcohol level rise fast”, says Hingson. Across the board there seems to be inherent brain vulnerabilities, and genetic vulnerabilities, that put a person at risk Women also experience blackouts more often. They are smaller on average than men and have a higher percentage of body fat, which means their bodies have less water to dilute the alcohol they drink – so their blood alcohol level rises faster. In 2017, Amie Haas of Palo Alto University in California found that women would routinely blackout with three fewer drinks than men. A 2015 study showed that women who consumed only one more drink than their usual amount had a 13% higher chance of blacking out than men. Aside from the sex differences, there could be a genetic component to who is more likely to blackout. Individuals whose mothers had a history of alcohol problems were found to be more at risk. Another study, this time on more than 1,000 pairs of twins, found that a genetic link accounted for half the blackouts experienced. The genetic difference seems to play out in the brain, too. One longitudinal study of adolescents aged 12-21, led by Reagan Wetherill of the University of Pennsylvania, showed that certain individuals who later went on to abuse alcohol and experience blackouts, were less able to suppress their actions. This could be seen on brain scans, even before they were drinking alcohol. “Across the board there seems to be inherent brain vulnerabilities, and genetic vulnerabilities, that put a person at risk,” she says. Worse, studies on mice suggest that heavy drinking may even lead to additional changes in the brain. Equally worrying is that the same people who are more prone to blackouts – teenagers and university students – are at a physically more vulnerable age. “There’s growing evidence that particularly if you are younger, it’s really quite unsafe for a developing brain,” says Haas. That’s because adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol compared to adults. One reason for this is that the frontal lobe of the brain is the last to develop, at around 25. Consent wormhole Like the risk factors, the consequences of blacking out are not only worse for adolescents, but also for women. Haas and colleagues showed that women who experienced blackouts were more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour while in a blackout state, compared to men and to drinkers who didn’t blackout at all. These women also showed more regret the following day. You have to rely on a preponderance of evidence to determine whether or not consent was given Evidence also shows that women with a history of sexual assault are more likely to be re-victimised if they are in an alcohol-induced blackout – compared to binge-drinkers who didn’t blackout. This is because they are risk while they under the influence due to impaired decision making, especially when it comes to assessing potentially dangerous situations, but they are also at risk afterwards because they cannot rely on their memory of what happened. This means there is a catch-22. Those experiencing blackouts may be more vulnerable to potential perpetrators in the moment. But if they try to press charges after, they also are vulnerable to having their cases dismissed. That is true even in places with an “affirmative consent” standard, where unless someone has indicated their willingness, it’s assault. “If it’s ‘he said/she said’, you have to rely on a preponderance of evidence to determine whether or not consent was given,” says Wetherill. One party being blackout complicates that evidence. Take Canada, where affirmative consent is necessary. As a Globe & Mail investigation recently found, the courts tend to want a complainant who is so drunk she probably has blacked out at least partially – but at the same time, a complainant who has blacked out isn’t seen as a reliable source of information about what happened. It’s tricky because people can blackout and look quite sober In the US, meanwhile, laws vary by state. Most say that someone who is “mentally incapacitated” cannot give consent. But New York, for example, says mental incapacitation can legally result only from involuntarily being given a drink or drug, not from having chosen to drink. States that include voluntary drinking, on the other hand, usually include the caveat that the accused must ‘reasonably’ have realised the person was incapacitated. But since people who have blacked out can seem highly functioning, the accused can argue that they didn’t realise. “It’s tricky because people can blackout and look quite sober,” says White. “You don’t always have to [appear] severely intoxicated to blackout.” Sarah Hepola has ample experience of this kind of disconnect. She says that, during her blackouts, she could still function, take part in conversations and respond to jokes, in the same way that Goodwin’s subjects could perform calculations. Only those who knew her well could recognise her “glassy-eyed unplugged” look of being in a blackout state. “It was like nobody was home… like I was talking but wasn’t receiving,” she says. But despite how she may have looked to outsiders, she knows she wasn’t herself. “I definitely think my decisions were impaired,” Hepola says. “I was highly impulsive, wildly unguarded and exhibitionistic, even sexually aggressive at times in ways that didn’t make sense to me the next day… based on what people told me.” This is why some university policies spell it out more clearly: “An individual may experience a blackout state in which they appear to be giving consent but does not actually have conscious awareness or the ability to consent,” Amherst College warns in its sexual misconduct policy. Similarly Michigan University states: “A person who is intoxicated is legally unable to give consent to sexual activity, meaning that sexual intimacy with someone who is ‘mentally incapacitated’ meets the legal definition of a sexual assault.” Screening questionnaires about alcohol use now routinely ask about prior blackout experiences It’s perhaps therefore not surprising that a person who regularly experiences blackouts is also more likely to experience other negative consequences of drinking, from the more mundane (like missing appointments or coming to work late) to the more serious (like having an injury or overdosing from using illegal substances). This makes blackouts a useful marker and predictor of other detrimental behaviour. For these reasons, questions about alcoholic blackouts are now increasingly being used in screening tools to quickly get at whether someone is a recreational drinker or a problem drinker. Blackout screening Mary-Beth Miller, an addiction psychologist at the University of Missouri, found that a simple intervention technique could help blackout drinkers reduce their drinking, a finding she first showed in ex-army veterans and then extended to university drinkers. The intervention is called “personalised normative feedback”. It is an online questionnaire that asks individuals about their drinking habits, and reports back how much they are drinking compared to others who are similar in age and background. Blackouts, her team found, serve as a “teachable moment after which individuals are more likely to respond to intervention”. Screening questionnaires about alcohol use now routinely ask about prior blackout experiences, which could make it easier to target and find individuals who need help. Simply asking about the amount an individual has drunk was not found to be effective. “If you are screening specifically for blackouts, it makes your screening more specific, instead of trying to intervene with every person who comes into your clinic,” Miller says. These interventions are not time-consuming or expensive, making Miller hopeful that she and colleagues can build upon them to develop even more effective interventions. She hopes to encourage a drinking culture where people understand that “you don’t have to get completely wasted to have a good time.” Some messed-up behaviours get laughed off and normalised Other researchers hope that asking about previous blackouts will in turn help reduce other types of risky behaviour. “It’s definitely interesting that a blackout is one of the most negative consequences of alcohol, and it might be a canary in the coalmine for more significant problems,” Haas says. For those who experience regular blackouts, a good first step is to better monitor your own alcohol intake and ask friends around you to do the same. That’s easier said than done. For Hepola, it is only looking back that she could see the warning signs. Even at the time she knew she “didn’t want to be that drunk” – but still couldn’t stop drinking. “Some messed-up behaviours get laughed off and normalised and sometimes we get distanced from the emotional and physical damage it [alcohol] causes,” says Hepola. She has now been sober for eight years and is glad to no longer fall into the black trapdoors of memory loss. It has made her life a lot simpler, she says. --- Melissa Hogenboom is a senior journalist at BBC Future. You can follow her on twitter or facebook.

'I was kidnapped in London and trafficked for sex',"Anna came to London from Romania in 2011 intending to study, but she was snatched off the street, flown to Ireland and sold for sex.",,8 August 2018,BBC News,"Anna came to London from Romania intending to study, but first she needed to earn some money. She took temporary jobs - waitressing, cleaning, maths tutoring. Then one day in March 2011 she was snatched off the street, flown to Ireland and put through nine months of hell. Anna was nearly home. There was just enough time to nip inside and eat lunch before leaving for her next cleaning job. She was wearing headphones and listening to Beyoncé singing I Was Here as she walked down the street in Wood Green, north London. She was just a few doors away. She reached into her bag to pull out her keys when suddenly someone grabbed her by the neck from behind, covered her mouth, and dragged into the back of a dark red car. There were three of them, two men and a woman. They were slapping her, punching her, and screaming threats in Romanian. Her ears were ringing. The woman in the passenger seat grabbed her bag and pulled the glasses from her face. If she didnt do what they told her, they shouted, her family in Romania would be killed. ""I didnt know what was happening or where they were taking me,"" Anna says. ""I was imagining everything - from organ harvesting or prostitution, to being killed, to God knows what."" The woman was going through her bag, looking in her wallet, scrolling through the recent calls and Facebook friends on her phone, looking at her papers. Her passport was there - she carried it everywhere after her previous one was stolen from her room. Anna could see there was no point trying to escape from the car, but when they arrived at an airport and she was left alone with just one of the men, she began to wonder if this was her chance. Could she appeal to airport staff for help? ""Its hard to scream when you feel so threatened,"" she says. ""They had my papers, they knew where my mum was, they knew everything about me."" It was a risk she couldnt bring herself to take. Watch Doing Money, a drama based on Annas story, at 21:00 on BBC Two, on Monday 5 November Viewers in the UK can catch up later online Watch the trailers here At the check-in desk, she was crying and her face was red, but the woman behind the counter didnt seem to notice. When the man presented their passports, she just smiled and handed them boarding cards. Trying to pretend they were a couple, he rushed Anna through security to the boarding gates, and took seats right at the back of the plane. He told her not to move, not to scream and not to cry, or he would kill her. Anna heard the captain announce that they were flying to an airport in Ireland - shed never heard of it. Her face was wet with tears as she walked off the plane, but like the woman at the check-in desk the air stewardess simply smiled. This time Anna had decided that once in the airport she would run, but it turned out to be no bigger than a bus station and two more Romanian men were waiting for them. The fat one reached out for her hand, smiled and said, ""At least this one looks better."" It was then that she realised why she had been kidnapped. ""I knew, at that point, that I was going to be sold,"" she says. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Anna spoke about being held captive by sex traffickers on the BBCs Outlook programme The men drove her to a dirty flat, upstairs, not far from a bookies. The car broke down on the way. Inside, the blinds were closed and the air smelled of alcohol, cigarettes and sweat. Men smoked and looked at laptops in the living room. On the table more than a dozen mobile phones rang, buzzed and vibrated constantly, while girls wearing little or nothing came and went between rooms. Annas clothes were ripped from her body by a woman wearing a red robe and flip flops, assisted by some of the men. And from then on she was brutalised. Pictures were taken of her in underwear in front of a red satin sheet pinned to the wall, so that she could be advertised on the internet. She was given more names than she can remember - she was Natalia, Lara, Rachel, Ruby. She was 18, 19, and 20, from Latvia, Poland, or Hungary. She was then forced to have sex with thousands of men. She didnt see daylight for months. She was only allowed to sleep when there were no clients but they came round the clock - up to 20 of them per day. Some days there was no food, other days maybe a slice of bread or someones leftovers. Deprived of food and sleep, and constantly abused, she lost weight fast and her brain stopped working properly. Customers paid 80-100 euros for half an hour, or 160-200 euros for an hour. Some left Anna bleeding, or unable to stand, or in so much pain that she thought she must be close to death. Others would ask her if she knew where she was, if shed been out to hear the traditional music in the pubs, if shed visited the local beauty spots. But she says they knew that she and the other girls were held against their will. ""They knew that we were kept there,"" she says. ""They knew, but they didnt care."" It was obvious from the bruises which covered every inch of Annas body - fresh ones appearing every day where older ones were beginning to fade away - and it didnt bother them. She hated them all. Find out more Anna spoke to Jo Fidgen on Outlook on the BBC World Service You can listen again here In July, four months into Annas captivity, the races were on and the phones were ringing more than ever. Then one day the police crashed into the flat and arrested all the girls. Mysteriously, the men and the woman who ran the show, had disappeared in advance with the laptops and most of the cash. Anna wondered how they had known the police were coming. The police took pictures of the flat, of the used condoms and the underwear and told Anna and the other three trafficked women to get dressed. She told them that they didnt have any clothes and that they were being held there against their will. ""You could clearly see there were signs that we had no power over anything - no clothes, no identity papers,"" she says. ""I tried to tell them, nobody listened."" She was glad to be arrested, though. She felt sure the police would eventually realise that they were victims. But still they didnt listen. The four women spent the night in a cell and were taken to court the following morning. A solicitor explained there would be a brief hearing, they would be charged with running a brothel, fined, and freed a few hours later. It wasnt a big deal, he said. It was just part of the routine when the races were on - sex workers and sometimes pimps were arrested and released again. When the women left the court Anna had an impulse to run, though she knew she had nowhere to go and no money. She was given no chance, anyway - her captors were waiting for them outside, holding the car doors open. In Romania her mother read the headlines about the young women running a brothel in Ireland, her own daughters name among them. By that stage shed already seen the photos the men had posted on Annas Facebook account too - images of her naked or in ill-fitting lingerie, covered in bruises. Alongside them were comments in which Anna boasted about her new life and all the money she was making as a sex worker in Ireland. More lies, typed out by the men on their laptops. Not only had her mother seen these photographs, the neighbours had seen them, Annas friends had seen them. None knew that she had been trafficked and was being held against her will. At first, her mother had tried to do something. But when she called her daughter there was never any answer. ""My mum went to the police in Romania,"" Anna says. ""But they said, Shes over the age of consent and shes out of the country, so she can do whatever she wants."" Eventually, Facebook deleted her account because of the indecent images and if anyone looked for her on social media it would have seemed that she no longer existed. After the police raid, the four girls were moved around a lot, staying in different cities in different flats and hotels. But their lives remained as bad as ever - they continued to be abused at all times of day and night. Anna didnt think her situation could get any worse until she overheard her tormentors making plans to take her to the Middle East. She had to get away. ""I still didnt really know exactly where I was,"" she says. ""But I knew that I had a better chance of escaping from Belfast, or Dublin, or wherever they had me, than escaping from somewhere in the Middle East."" She took the womans flip flops and opened the door. She had to go very quickly and very quietly. She hadnt run or properly stretched the muscles in her legs for months, but now she had to move fast. What saved her was the fact that men occasionally asked for one of the women to be taken to them, rather than visiting the flat where they were held. Anna found these call-outs terrifying. ""You didnt know what crazy person was waiting for you or what they would do to you,"" she says. ""But any time I was out of that flat I would make mental maps of where I was. While they were transferring us from one point to another I would form maps in my mind - remembering the buildings, the street signs, and the things that we passed."" There was also one man - Andy, a convicted drug dealer on a tag - who never wanted to have sex, only to talk. A friend of his was trying to break into the brothel-keeping business and he wanted information. ""I had to gamble at that point,"" Anna says. ""I didnt trust him, but he offered me a place where I could hide."" Relying on her incomplete mental map, Anna made it to Andys address, only there was no answer. There was nothing to do but wait and hope that the pimps would not find her. The gamble paid off. Andy had to return before midnight because of his tag. And he let her stay. One of the first things Anna did was to call her mother. The phone rang, and her mothers partner answered. As soon as he realised who was calling he began urging her never to call again, and never to visit. Theyd received so many threats from the pimps and traffickers, her mother was now terrified, he said. ""So I said to him, OK, Ill make it easy for you. If anybody rings you and threatens you just tell them that Im dead to you and to my mum,"" Anna says. He hung up on her. At this point, despite having no papers or passport, and despite her experience of the brothel raid - when she had been prosecuted instead of rescued - Anna decided to contact the police. And this time, fortunately, they listened to her. It turned out that Anna was now in Northern Ireland, and she was told to attend a rendezvous with a senior policeman in a coffee shop. ""He took one of those white paper napkins and asked me to write down the names of the people who did this to me on it,"" she says. When she pushed it back to him across the table she could see that he was shocked. Hed been looking for those people for years, he said. A two-year investigation followed. Eventually Annas former captors were arrested, but she was so worried for her own safety and her mothers that she decided she couldnt testify against them in court. Another girl shed known from the flat did give evidence, though, and the gang were convicted of human trafficking, controlling prostitution and money laundering in Northern Ireland. Each of them was sentenced to two years. They served six months in custody before they were sentenced, then eight months in prison after being convicted, with the remainder spent on supervised licence. They had already served two years in a Swedish prison on the same set of offences involving one of the same victims. ""I was happy that they were arrested but I wasnt happy about the sentences,"" she says. ""I guess nothing in this life is fair."" Where to get help If you suspect someone is a victim of human trafficking, contact the police - call 999 if its an emergency, or 101 if its not urgent. If youd prefer to stay anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. If you want confidential advice about trafficking before calling the police, there are a number of specialist organisations you can talk to: The Modern Slavery helpline 0800 0121 700, is open 24 hours a day. If you think a child is in danger of trafficking you can contact the the NSPCCs helpline 0808 8005 000. Later, with other women, Anna gave testimony to the Unionist politician, Lord Morrow, who had become so concerned about the increasing number of stories he heard about children and adults forced to work in brothels, farms and factories that he put forward a new bill to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Human Trafficking and Exploitation Act, passed in 2015, made Northern Ireland the first and only place in the UK where the act of buying sex is a crime. The act of selling sex, by contrast, was decriminalised. Anna takes satisfaction from her role in this process. ""This law helps the victim and it criminalises the buyer and the trafficker,"" she says. ""So it destroys the ring."" If even a small percentage of the men who used to pay for sex are now discouraged from doing so, thats still a success, Anna argues. And people like her who are trafficked can live without fear, she says, because instead of being criminalised for being involved in prostitution, theyre now more likely to benefit from support. In 2017, it also became illegal to buy sex in the Republic of Ireland, where Annas horrific ordeal began. Her nine months in sexual slavery have left her permanently injured. Men damaged her body in the places where they penetrated her. Her lower back and knees constantly ache, and theres a patch at the back of her head where her hair stopped growing because it was pulled out so many times. She suffers from terrifying flashbacks. Sometimes she cannot sleep, and when she does sleep she has nightmares. And sometimes she still smells that smell, the alcohol, mixed with the cigarettes and the sweat, the semen, and the breath of her abusers. But shes looking forward now. She shopped the people who sold her body, shes helped change the law, and after years of not even speaking, her relationship with her mother is good. ""Me and my mum had to go on a really long journey to get her to understand what happened to me,"" she says. ""She had to learn from me and I had to learn from her, but now we are fine."" Anna started a degree course in the UK but had to drop out because she couldnt afford the fees and didnt qualify for any funding. She now has a job in hospitality and its going well. ""I would love with all my heart to return to my studies at some point,"" she says. ""But for now I have to work, work, work, and keep focused."" All names have been changed.
