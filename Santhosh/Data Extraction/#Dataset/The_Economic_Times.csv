Inner Power,"The agnostics say they cant suddenly start believing in God, others who already believe say they have no faith left that He can perform a miracle for them.",,2014-06-17 05:50:00+00:00,,"In a head-to-head evaluation of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) rehabilitation programme against two well-validated professionally developed psychotherapies , it was found that AA was just as effective. The well-known 12-step facilitation turned out to be as good as the best therapies professionals had. It also showed that their success rate was a decent 36%. But did they rely heavily on God to achieve this?For instance, point #2 of the AA’s 12-step charter for healing states, “Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.” But the moment newcomers read Step 2, they are confronted with a dilemma, often a serious one. The agnostics say they can’t suddenly start believing in God, others who already believe say they have no faith left that He can perform a miracle for them, and the atheists refuse to believe in Him. How does the AA respond?It rephrases the step as “recognising a higher power that can give strength”. It also dilutes the in-your-face impact by reiterating that when they speak of God, they mean our own conception of Him. This is apparently all that’s needed to begin the spiritual growth, and to effect our first conscious relation with God as we understand Him. That immediately shows a convenient way out for believers, agnostics and atheists alike.Like, who says that God or “higher power” has to be an external agency?

Correction begins with admission,"Tiger Woods has now ‘rediscovered his childhood religion.

The championgolfer , who faced censure for his alleged extra-marital liaisons, said he hoped to relearn the lesson of selfrestraint taught by Buddhism. His statement had been analysed “like a State of Union address even though the only union Tiger Woods addressed was his own” , a sympathetic columnist said, “( for) this was no voluntary conversion to an old religion. Rather , this was a forced one to the new Oprahite religion of emotional openness and making public one’s miseries and failings.” Newspersons who asked the Dalai Lama to comment discovered that the Tibetan spiritual leader was blissfully unaware of Tiger Woods’ travails, having somehow been uninformed of the golfer’s triumphs as well. When the matter was explained to him, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist extolled the importance of ‘self-discipline with awareness of consequences’ . The embattled golf champion himself said as much in his carefully scripted statement of apology: in recent years he had ‘drifted away’ from the Buddhist values of his upbringing which taught that “a craving for things outside ourselves causes unhappy and pointless search for security” . But would that satisfy the scolds berating Woods for letting his impulses get the better of him? As his former coach, Butch Harmon , said, “( They) want Woods to stand there in front of everybody , take his medicine, be humble , be embarrassed, be humiliated , and answer the questions.” His self-lacerating public apology could also be part of the famous 12-step plan for recovering from addictions, compulsions and other behavioural problems. The process starts with the admission that one is powerless against the demons of addiction and compulsion . One then moves on to admit “a greater power that can give strength” . One way of achieving this, as encoded by the next step, is by establishing cosmic connections: make a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand Him, says the original Alcoholics Anonymous programme . In its summation, the Bhagavad Gita calls it the supreme secret of transcendence (psychologists might call it ‘transference’ ) which promises to empower the seeker to withstand most severe soul-crushing pressures .

A simple case of sorry and thanks,"Alcoholics Anonymous, the community that helps people to stay sober and help other alcoholics do the same has always known there is a spiritual dimension involved in its work.",,2006-11-07 00:10:00+00:00,,"Alcoholics Anonymous, the community that helps people to stay sober and help other alcoholics do the same has always known there is a spiritual dimension involved in its work. Which is why a typical individual course for a newcomer often includes a ritual of prayer and/or meditation. Which is also why a very important step in the AA’s 12-step recovery programme includes a directive to make a list of all persons a member may have harmed, and become willing to make amends to them all except when to do so would injure them or others. Recovering alcoholics find this step not only to be one of the hardest to carry out but also the most emotionally rewarding. But are only overdue apologies for misdeeds enough to motivate oneself? Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi who garnered wide attention with his best-selling book, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and has emerged as one of the leading figures in the growing positive-psychology movement, thinks not. He argues that the most rewarding individual happiness lies in the skilful performance of meaningful work that fully occupies one’s attention. That, indeed, showing overdue gratitude is also just as important. He refers to an experiment called “gratitude intervention” where volunteers are assigned randomly to various “interventions” and their happiness is assessed before and after. In essence, they are asked to think about a person who was kind or helpful to them but who has never been thanked for it. Then the volunteer is supposed to write a one-page letter of thanks, make an appointment with the target person, and read the letter in his or her presence. The volunteers who are randomly assigned to do this task show significant increase in happiness half a year after completing it. And although other interventions based on positive psychology experiments also show impressive results, this appears to be the most effective. It’s interesting to note that both a delayed sorry and thanks, which are basically corrective measures compressing the passing of time between the original event and its proper closure, should make us feel good. It must mean that we ourselves are essentially good — a quality we forget to remember more readily than not. In other words, we often don’t know why we’re not happy and carry on living, ignorant that a simple action could, in fact, elevate us.",{},"['simple', 'person', 'randomly', 'alcoholics', 'case', 'step', 'thanks', 'sorry', 'overdue', 'happiness', 'psychology', 'work', 'volunteers']","Which is why a typical individual course for a newcomer often includes a ritual of prayer and/or meditation.

"Go cold turkey, for god’s sake!",A friend who attended a workshop of Overeaters Anonymous says it is possible for any ravenous soul to eat much less than he or she usually does.,,2010-09-30 07:50:00+00:00,,"A friend who attended a workshop of Overeaters Anonymous says it is possible for any ravenous soul to eat much less than he or she usually does. “Even for you,” he said, “and the break really helps.”Well, in this world, there are rehab clinics and therapy centres with both ordinary and fancy names to wean you or anyone away from anything and everything irrespective of age and addiction. They are for everybody, from sweettoothed 75-plus-year-olds to 40-ish alcoholics to teenaged brownsugar addicts to Facebook-crazy primary schoolchildren.The idea of such we-help-you-livebetter entities is to help you take a recess amid excesses in the hope that it helps you stay in control of your work and life in the long run. It is true that all this rehab business has been on for a long time now, but it never goes out of fashion for obvious reasons.One expression that is in sync with changing realities and times is the immensely likeable “going cold turkey” . Which means if you are addicted to heroin , instead of confessing you want to go to a rehab unit, you could say, “I want to go heroin cold turkey” . School kids could proudly declare, “We plan to go social media cold turkey” if they wish to keep off keyboard or mouse or smart phones for three-four days or even a week.The fact is cold turkey is no longer associated with food, drinks, drugs, sex and related things alone. You could go “work cold turkey” , and detoxify your officeclouded mind, unwind, recharge your live-positive batteries, stabilise blood pressure and return, cleansed! In fact, companies and governments must insist that their employees go work cold turkey once in a while, especially immediately after intense bouts of hard work.Going cold turkey for religious reasons is as old as religions or maybe, older. In fact, religious prohibitions may have helped people preserve their faith, identity and health. Research shows that any religious ban or temporary refrain on consumption and action has practical considerations as well. Our prophets seemed to have taken into account everything from weather to hygiene to welfare of their people before writing edicts on dos and don’ts . Since the time we started recording history, physicians across faiths have advised fasting as a therapy to feel better and look better.Another friend who attended a Vipassana course near Delhi rightly pointed out that going cold turkey is possible without even realising it. Of course, there are myriad ways to distract oneself and go cold turkey. Politicians contesting elections do that. A hard day’s night gets a new meaning in poll campaigning which, ironically, is one of the many ways our politicians keep fit.To be sure, going cold turkey or being forced to do that is as old as the human race. Later when kingdoms emerged, brothers asked brothers to go kingdom cold turkey. The list of examples is endless even in regimes that had no emperors. Comrade Mao Zedong himself had forced Deng Xiaoping to go politics cold turkey and banished him to China’s hinterland.To cut a long story short, one should not feel that going cold turkey, of one’s own volition or by force, is always bad. When people in democracies vote unpopular governments out of power, what they do is to push their governments to go government cold turkey. It is good to go cold turkey despite the risk of delirium tremens and irrespective of whether the case is of overwork or drug addiction or political one-upmanship or inefficiency.One constantly feels that some people must go profession cold turkey. A few names that crop up are of V S Naipaul who should be told to go writing cold turkey; Nicholas Sarkozy who should be asked to go politics cold turkey and Malayalam film stars Mohan Lal and Mammooty who should go acting cold turkey. Oh! How could one miss him? Will someone advise Suresh Kalmadi to go sports management cold turkey, please?",{},"['governments', 'fact', 'cold', 'turkey', 'gods', 'religious', 'going', 'sake', 'long', 'work', 'rehab', 'writing']","You could go “work cold turkey” , and detoxify your officeclouded mind, unwind, recharge your live-positive batteries, stabilise blood pressure and return, cleansed!

Living to see another day,"What's so great about living for the day?

Or for that matter, its various high-speed variants that urge us to exist in the here and now, the passing present, that urgent, ephemeral and apparently most-important ‘moment’ ? Stuff like “For the past is but a shadow and the future an unknown; therefore, voyager revel in the instant you transit through for ’tis the only thing you know” . (Yes, it’s made up, but you get the drift.) The Bible says give us this day our daily bread — and not, for instance, our week’s supply. Buddhists tell us to take one breath at a time. The Gita’s advice is to concentrate on present action. Alcoholics Anonymous, whose rules are similar — namely, to lay off the liquor only on a day-to-day basis — is at least understandable . Psychologists know there’s a neat therapeutic trick of reinforcement involved by means of which a person can reward himself with one brownie point on completion of each 24-hour period that passes without downing a drink. Yet, when that same rule gets applied to everyone across all levels of living, it hardly makes sense. If all of us did that — which naturally would be the goal of such an exhortation — and took it literally, then we’d end up in monasteries, mountain-tops or in our own reclusive and absolute worlds. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong in that, but if taken to its logical extreme, it would be like how most animals live: not for the day, not for the minute, not even for the moment because their lives are a mindless and biotic persistence that keeps traversing through infinitely thin slices of time till that fleeting instant also passes through them and they die. So, if living one day at a time means don’t think about tomorrow or the next day and just live the now, it’s a no-brainer . Because unlike animals, we have an awareness that allows us to learn from past mistakes and anticipate possible futures and, therefore , why should we unnecessarily and suddenly renounce this added feature of our brains? Also, what if all the enlightened people in our history had thought they should be living in the moment and not tomorrow, not next year; that they should be enjoying life today? If they had simply allowed their wisdom to lie fallow while wallowing in its bliss by themselves, would we have had some of our greatest religions today? No. It goes without saying they definitely lived for another day.",{},"['means', 'moment', 'passes', 'live', 'tomorrow', 'living', 'today', 'present', 'day', 'past']","What's so great about living for the day?

By 2007, playwright Sam Shepard had an Oscar, a Pulitzer, and a driving under the influence of alcohol case, after his 2007 arrest. To be fair, he claims he only had two tequila shots. It was also 7:45pm, and he acted in The Notebook. Next Amit’s addiction story started with his college friends telling him to try a shot of alcohol at a wedding “just one time”, followed by peer pressure to “smoke only when you are drinking”. He discovered that drinking and smoking relieved the stress of cramming for exams, dealing with family issues and keeping up with his ‘cool’ college gang. And in just a few months, the one shot of alcohol turned to several glasses a day, followed by the need to smoke a couple of cigarettes every hour, resulting in loss of health, while burning a massive hole in his pocket.Multiple factors come into play, which decide whether someone becomes an addict or not.Dr H Chandrashekar, head of the department of psychiatry at Victoria Hospital, Bengaluru, says that while addiction usually runs in the family, the cause is multifactorial and varied, and cannot be attributed to one single reason.“One study found that addiction among children of alcoholic parents was three-four times higher when compared to other children,” he says. “It is also found that a dopamine-dependent reward pathway present in the brain is more active in persons exhibiting addictive behaviour. Patients suffering from personality disorders or psychiatric illnesses are more susceptible to addiction. Inability to confer to social norms, defiant behaviour and the resulting ostracisation can make one dependent on substances and sustain its abuse,” he says.Dr Jyoti Kapoor, senior psychiatrist at Gurugram-based Paras Hospitals, says the causes could be psychological, such as stress, anxiety, emotional issues, depression and psychosis; environmental, such as drug availability, peer pressure and social sanction; and genetic — epidemiological studies of twins and families have demonstrated a genetic contribution of 30-60% in developing addiction.“Substance abuse disorders are classified in medical science as an illness but the society still looks at them as a characterological trait that the sufferer is solely responsible for. Although sociocultural factors play a significant role in substance-use behaviour, genetic and biological influences can’t be discounted. These factors make an individual vulnerable to addiction and develop the mental and behavioural disorders related to substance use,” she says.Dr Kamna Chhibber, head of mental health at the department of mental health and behavioural sciences at Delhi-based Fortis La Femme, says poor family support, the need to look ‘cool’, challenging circumstances, poor coping abilities, weak problem-solving abilities, poor self-control and a desire to escape problems instead of solving them are also factors.The term addiction is used only when the individual cannot continue to lead his/her life without the consumption of the substance, says Chhibber.“They require increased amounts of the substance with time. The continued and consistently increasing consumption of the substance disrupts normal life, causing individuals to neglect other activities in favour of taking the drugs ,” she says.According to Kapoor, every substance has the potential to harm the body if used in excess.“Excessive use of alcohol causes adverse effects on the liver, stomach, pancreas, brain and nerves, resulting in associated medical conditions like liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, memory disturbances, seizures, psychiatric illnesses and peripheral neuropathy. Other common drugs similarly affect various body organs, especially the liver, kidney and brain. Needle-users are at a risk of damage to blood vessels, leading to blocked blood vessels (thrombophlebitis), endocarditis and infections like hepatitis and HIV. Drugs also cause inhibition of immune system with an increased risk of infection, slowing of the gastrointestinal system, increased somnolence, respiratory depression, increased risk of seizure, increased risk of accidents and nutritional deficiencies,” she says.The withdrawal effects of drugs have further physical effects ranging from severe anxiety to disorientation, delirium and central nervous system side effects, she says.Apart from the physical effects, “psychosocial consequences include precipitation of psychiatric illnesses like anxiety or panic attacks, depression, paranoia, obsessions and delusions. Interpersonal relationships are affected, leading to further isolation and reliance on drug addicts and drug peddlers. Academic and professional downfall is a direct consequence of increased preoccupation with drug use and effects of drugs”, she says.Amits situation worsened to such an extent that days and nights merged into one and his life would not go forward without cigarettes and alcohol. He was in no position to understand that this wasnt normal. His addiction was controlling his life.According to Chhibber, the use of a substance that you are not in control of warrants treatment.“If you notice that you have a lot of craving and urge to consume a substance, that you are not able to go on with life without consuming it regularly, that you need more quantities of the substance to feel good, the lack of availability of the substance affects your mood or interferes with your daily life and functioning, that consumption of the substance happens at the cost of your work and personal life, you need to seek help,” she says.Apart from that, if you notice yourself neglecting responsibilities at home, school or work, losing interest in activities you once enjoyed, withdrawing from friends and family, increasingly neglecting personal hygiene or trying to hide the extent of your drug or alcohol use from others, it is time to consult a professional, says Kapoor.Dr Faiyaz Ali Maniyar, senior consultant physician at Bengalurubased Primecare Hospital, says it is always better to take professional help with the support of family members to treat addiction.“A high-quality treatment programme will begin with a medical detox to address physical dependence and restore brain functioning back to normal. Various alternative and traditional therapies are available, which identify underlying issues, identify and change unhealthy ways of thinking and behaving, and come up with strategies to help cope with cravings and other triggers,” he says. “There are also self-help organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, as well as religious and moralistic paths that could be useful.”In Amits case, it was a friends mother who noticed that he had become irregular in his visits to their house and decided to find out what was wrong. In denial at first, Amit went into a shell. It was only after constant prodding, without making him feel guilty, that she got the facts out. After that, a combination of treatment paths put him on the track to normalcy.While Chhibber says abstinence from the consumption of substances is the key to preventing addictions, Kapoor says awareness and education are vital.“Addiction needs to be understood and accepted as an illness so that susceptible individuals can come forward for education and help. Curtailing availability of substance with a stringent execution of the law is important. Drug peddlers target schools and young adolescents as they are the most susceptible. Parents and teachers need to be educated to identify and handle these issues. Being punitive towards students who have been found to be experimenting with alcohol, cigarettes or drugs only shoves the dirt under the carpet. One needs to empathise and understand their issues to guide them. School counsellors have a major role to play here,” says Kapoor. “Identifying vulnerable population with a family history of substance abuse or other psychiatric problems is also imperative in starting early intervention.”Addiction need not just be substance addiction. Behavioural addiction refers to conditions where a person engages in a certain type of behaviour repeatedly, even if the behaviour causes harm. Common behavioural addictions include gambling addiction, shopping addiction, hoarding, internet addiction, smartphone addiction, gaming addiction, sex addiction and porn addiction. However, experts continue to debate the existence, the diagnostic criteria and possible treatments for these conditions.- Sudden changes in mood and behaviour- Staying aloof and being disinterested- Sudden change in academic/ work performance- Needing extra money consistently- Consistently having bloodshot eyes, dilated or constricted pupils- Drastic weight loss over a short period of time- Evidence of drug use on the body, such as needle marks- Hostility when confronted about drug use- Disinterest in personal hygiene and grooming- Shakiness or tremors- Unable or unwilling to quit using drugs and alcohol despite financial, family, health and legal problems- Encourage the individual to seek help and work on the problem- Be empathic: Guilt prevents people from opening up to others who may judge or criticise them. Addicts feel a lack of control over their behaviour and thus, feel helpless. They need to be assured that help is available- Help them stay away from people and situations where there is a chance of consuming a substance- Support them by working in accordance with the suggestions of the expert being consulted- Withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous by themselves, so talk to a professional and get the right care",{},"['disorder', 'affects', 'addiction', 'anxiety', 'delusions', 'directly', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'substance', 'need', '2007', 'cause', 'help', 'family', 'behaviour', 'kidney', 'brain', 'paranoia', 'drugs']","She was sentenced to 30 days in jail, but was released after only three hours because the system works.

Can NREGS become more effective if treated as a business?,"A school of thought has emerged that believes several social sector initiatives, if promoted as business enterprises, can have greater impact.",,2010-04-05 11:34:00+00:00,,"Can Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) be turned into a profitable business venture? Or, can Mumbai-based Party Hard Drivers (PHD), the first company in the country to specialise in providing drivers by night so that people do not drink and drive, be called “social business’’? As cathedrals of capitalism tottered on the brink of fiscal chaos following the Lehman collapse, high priests of socialism began pushing their ideology. Now, with the economy reviving, there are once again talks of fusion of the two “isms’’. There is a section of ideators that thinks several philanthropic efforts, if treated as “social business’’, can become profitable and have high welfare impact. “Social business’ ’ is a term used by Nobel laureate and maestro of microfinance Muhammad Yunus to describe a commercial activity where businesses whose primary goal is to help the targeted group plough their entire profits back into their work rather than give dividends to shareholders. According to Yunus, a social business enterprise is created not to maximise profits, but with a declared mission to maximise benefits to the people served, without incurring losses. It has become fashionable for some corporates to pontificate on corporate social responsibility (CSR), which social entrepreneurs call more of a PR exercise than a genuine effort to help the poor. As companies increase allocations for CSR activities and begin targeting the bottom of the pyramid, social business is gaining currency. While addressing industry leaders in Mumbai recently, Yunus, who pioneered microfinancing, said: “We, as humankind, have multidimensions: We have selfless parts and we have a self-centred part. Most of the businesses today are focused on the self-centred part. It is all about me, it is all about my. The social business is all about you. The objective of social business is not to maximise profit, but to get maximum social benefits.’’ The founder of Bangladesh’s Grameen Bank also proposed setting up a separate stock exchange for the listing of social enterprises as one of the funding sources for such firms. “The social business is not charity as it can be run through raising funds from the stock market. In the Indian context, social business can be possible in a number of areas such as water, health, urban poverty, education and environment,’’ Yunus said. There are some takers for Yunus’s proposal. Says Nishith Desai, founder of Nishith Desai Associates, a Mumbai-based international law firm, “If Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), for example , becomes part of the social business venture, raising funds and scaling up operations will not be a problem for it and it will turn into a profitable enterprise.’’ Desai said AA, if structured as a social business enterprise, could offer services under three slabs: some free of cost, some at lower rates and others at significantly higher rates. The “customers’ ’ of AA —the relatives of the persons using the services of AA—could invest in AA even as their kin gets rid of alcoholism, thereby making it financially viable.

Turbulent personal life = top-performing pro,Crises in their personal lives are spurring many young professionals to greater achievements in the workplace.,,2004-08-26 00:32:00+00:00,,"Turbulent personal life = top-performing pro Crises in their personal lives are spurring many young professionals to greater achievements in the workplace. LOPAMUDRA GHATAK By | , ET Online Aug 26, 2004, 12.32 AM IST Mid-life crisis is not the only ugly thing that sits like a crown of thorns over the heads of new age professionals. For young twenty and thirty somethings, life is more than just handling time and money effectively. As the rat race gets heated up, it is a mad scramble to reach the top. And for those who make it to the top, it is an even bigger struggle to remain perched there comfortably. With nuclear families becoming commonplace and traditional support systems disintegrating, pros nowadays have a lot to handle on their platter. A fast-paced hectic life makes it no better as professional demands climb. Add to that personal priorities and many often find themselves at a loss when it comes to dealing with crisis-like situations. As a 24/7 schedule becomes a regular feature, deadlines pile on the desktop and workload grows. In such situations, there is a constant effort to push personal lives to the backdrop as professional commitments gain centrestage. And many look at this a defined way of handling crisis management effectively, so that it does not impinge on their professional careers. â€œCrisis-like situations are not easy to handle, especially in a hectic work environment. Often itâ€™s a tough battle when personal crisis looms large because it can upset your professional life,â€� J Vishwakarma, a hospitality manager with a reputed hotel said. Having survived a tumultuous marriage and a rocky divorce, Vishwakarma knows it better. Although there â€œwas mental incompatibilityâ€� with his freelance artist wife, he feels that often â€œmany people end up spending long hours at work in order to avoid crisis-like situations at home.â€� Tulika Mehrotra is completely in sync with Vishwakarmaâ€™s views. The 27-year-old corporate communication manager with a leading IT firm in Bangalore had a tough time adjusting when her parents separated after being together for 25 years. Although she did not spend long hours in office, her â€œworkplace performance did get affectedâ€�. â€œI think that it was one of the worst crisis of my life. Since most of my close friends who have grown up with me found it an alien concept that my parents had split, it was no point talking to them. At work also, I would remain a little preoccupied and I knew that I was not being able to deliver my best. Finally, it got too much and I went on a long break,â€� Mehrotra candidly admits. Although she was lucky to have â€œhad a considerate superior, who understood the situation and just let me beâ€�, not everyone enjoys the same kind of liberty. With a sense of cut-throat competition pervading professional environments, every second counts and is crucial in lending that extra edge to stay ahead. Concentration coupled with dedication is what makes a pro tick in todayâ€™s battlefield. For the new age pros, therefore a sound mind is considered mandatory to be able to toil hard at the workplace and deliver success. Grappling hard with increasing work pressure and mounting stress, many pros often find themselves in the midst of crisis like syndromes, especially when dealing with marital problems, domestic doldrums or a mix of the professional and the personal problems. As the success graph of pros soars, many are compelled to spending reduced quality time with their family, friends and other support systems. In the wake of such a scenario, many pros are often forced to look outside towards external channels of support. Although support groups are not as commonplace in India as they are in the West, the picture is slowly changing and many pros are enrolling in different crisis support groups to help retain their sanity. â€œTwo years back, I went through absolute hell with an alcoholic and violent husband at home, who was constantly job-hopping. There was no stability and I was tired of the home atmosphere. I could not spend long hours at work because I had to take care of my toddler son. Finally, I started going for the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, which helped me understand othersâ€™ problems on similar lines,â€� Aneesha Basu, a marketing manager with a beverages major, said. The support group meetings helped her hold fort and she says that â€œit helped her from not cracking up in such dire straitsâ€�. With a hectic work profile, Basu could not afford to botch it up at work by losing her cool and concentration and she knew that â€œpersonal problems has to be dealt withâ€œ. Counselling, therapy, joining support groups â€“ there are many like Basu who seek external support to overcome moments of crisis in order to not let their professional life get affected. With competition peaking and consumerist behavioural trends becoming pronounced, many are forced to encounter crisis-like situations early in their lives. And for those who go through such episodes in their lives, it is a tremendous feeling of helplessness along with a sense of disillusionment at impending failure. â€œIt is in such moments that one realises oneâ€™s vulnerability. Although you might be a high-flier in office space, the inability to handle personal crisis hits you when you are faced with it. And then you realise that it does take a lot to face personal crisis without cracking up,â€� Rohit Manchanda, a businessman said. Having lost his parents in an accident, the 31-year-old had to quit his high-profile job with a media research firm to take charge of his dadâ€™s business. Emotional vulnerability often makes people look towards spirituality and Manchanda started attending spirituality classes to battle his emotional and mental vacuum. Psychologists opine that increasingly, many professionals are being swamped by crisis-like feelings early in their lives, primarily because of early careers. Such feeling is nothing but a natural outcome of the speeding up of the general life clock that goes on to justify the trend of racing against time. A recent survey conducted in the UK amongst 1,000 men and women aged from 25 to 35, revealed that eight out of ten successful young people who have risen to the top of their professions for a decade were deep in the throes of a crisis by the time they are in their late twenties. Instead of allowing themselves to be caught in an emotional rut and getting bogged down by crisis-like feelings, most young pros are now voicing their need for help in understanding their feelings of confusion, loss, alienation, loneliness, depression, anger, sadness, and guilt that are characteristic of any crisis. An ability to develop coping strategies for their uncomfortable but normal feelings and their ability to adjust to loss and maintain control over everyday life experiences also depends on the help they mange to obtain from family, friends and other support groups.",{},"['pro', 'support', 'situations', 'crisislike', 'crisis', 'topperforming', 'professional', 'turbulent', 'pros', 'lives', 'work', 'personal', 'life']","Turbulent personal life = top-performing proCrises in their personal lives are spurring many young professionals to greater achievements in the workplace.

Yet, twelve has interesting references and significance in fields as diverse as mythology, astrology, astronomy and sports.",,2012-01-01 03:07:00+00:00,,"It’s a number like any other. Yet, twelve has interesting references and significance in fields as diverse as mythology, astrology, astronomy and sports. As we enter 2012, read on what makes 12 so special. The Ancients Loved It... 1. Greek mythology has it that 12 Olympians — gods who live atop Mount Olympus — are the principal deities of the Greek pantheon. Zeus is the king of the gods. 2. Heracles, the Greek mythological hero, was given 12 impossible tasks to complete. The 12th task was capturing a multi-headed hound called Cerberus. 3. According to followers of Shia Islam, prophet Muhammad had 12 successors known as Imams. Shia Islam followers believe that the 12th and final Imam, Muhammad al Mahdi, will rise and restore order in the world. 4. In Christian mythology the number keeps turning up. Jesus had 12 apostles, including Judas Iscariot. When Judas betrays Jesus and commits suicide, Matthias becomes the 12th apostle. 5. The Purna Kumbh Mela takes place once in twelve years. The Maha Kumbh comes after 12 Purna Kumbhs and is held once every 144 years. The last Purna Kumbh Mela was in 2001. 60 million people landed up, making it the largest human gathering ever. So Much So that Our Traditions Revolve Around Them Even Today... 1. Christmas is celebrated across 12 days beginning Christmas Day (December 25). 2. Bar Mitzvah — a coming of age festival of the Jews — is observed when a girl turns 12. For a boy, it’s observed on his 13th birthday. 3. Cubans bring in the New Year by eating 12 grapes — each for a month gone by — at the stroke of midnight. The custom is supposed to bring luck. Our Bodies Like the Number... 1. The human body has 12 pairs of ribs. 2. Humans also have 12 pairs of cranial nerves. 3. The average man has 12 pints of blood. Women have 9 pints. So Do Star Gazers... 12 men have walked on the moon till date. Most of the world today uses the decimal system — we count things in multiples of 10. That probably comes from the fact that we have 10 fingers. However, ancient Egyptians did not count with their fingers. Instead, they chose to count with the joints on their fingers (excluding the thumb). That’s 12 clicks per hand. That’s perhaps why we started measuring time in units of 12 — 12 hours for half a day and 24 hours for a day. Ancient Indian astronomers too divided time into 12 halves between sunrise and sunset. The choice of 12 is attributed to the 12 lunar cycles in a year. ...And Astrologers Both Chinese and western zodiacs have 12 signs. The Chinese zodiac is divided by years and not months, unlike the western zodiac. For example, the period between January 23, 2012 and February 9, 2013 is called the year of the dragon.",{},"['zodiac', 'number', '12th', 'enter', 'western', '12', 'mythology', 'kumbh', 'greek', 'day', 'special', 'count', 'heres', 'purna']","As we enter 2012, read on what makes 12 so special.

The time zones of our life,Aphorisms telling us to live “one day at a time” turn out to be less cutesy if we think of a day as an extended metaphor for the present.,,2008-07-15 02:06:00+00:00,,"Aphorisms telling us to live ���one day at a time��� turn out to be less cutesy if we think of a day as an extended metaphor for the present. Then it begins to make a little more sense. Recovering drug abusers and alcoholics, for instance, are exhorted by their various anonymous organisations to do the same: just try to stay off the stuff for the coming 24 hours and not think of how they might be able to hold out during the next day, the week after or even luck out for a lifetime later without breaking into a cold turkey of anticipation immediately. The reason is, for most of us the future comes so heavily pre-loaded with the past and memories of experience that it skews the path ahead unfairly at times. As a result we hardly remain in the kind of control we would ideally like to be. In the 1964 classic Games People Play, the psychiatrist Eric Berne described the dysfunctional nature of such set patterns by calling them predetermined ���scripts���. He catalogued a series of mind games in which people play through an outlined and predictable sequence of ���transactions��� that are superficially plausible but which actually conceal motivations, include private significance to the parties involved and lead to a well-defined outcome that are usually counterproductive. Of course we can���t avoid history, much less disregard it, and those who don���t learn from its mistakes are indeed doomed to repeat them with unnecessarily distressing consequences. One day at a time also doesn���t mean repeating the same day forever because that would make it like instant history happening all the time in the present. Neither does it mean an unconcern about opportunity and potential since that would lock us eternally in the here and now. What living one day at a time actually means is being able to learn from the future before it takes place. Learning from the future is the art of trial and error without, in fact, trying or (hopefully) turning out to be erroneous. In a sense it���s a process of virtual extrapolation which makes the day more dynamic, meaningful and, ultimately, rewarding ��� during the course of the day itself. People who manage to do this also manage to shorten its duration from an arbitrary 24 hours down to the extremely thin slice of ���now��� moving across the continuum of all time available to them.

Age at first drink linked to binge drinking risk,"An early age of onset of drinking is a risk factor for subsequent heavy drinking and negative outcomes, scientists found.",,2014-09-24 19:15:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON: Teenagers who have their first drink at an early age are more likely to become a binge drinker or even an alcoholic, a new study has warned.An early age of onset of drinking is a risk factor for subsequent heavy drinking and negative outcomes, scientists found.The study found that starting to use alcohol at an early age and quickly progressing to drinking to intoxication jointly are related to underage alcohol use and binge drinking.Meghan E Morean, assistant professor of psychology at Oberlin College Ohio and adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine asked 295 adolescent drinkers (163 females, 132 males) who were predominantly Caucasian with an average age of 16 years to complete an anonymous survey about their substance use in February of 2010.These self-report questions assessed AO and age at first intoxication - for example, ""How old were you the first time you tried alcohol/got drunk?"" - as well as the previous months consumption of alcohol, including an assessment of the frequency of engaging in binge drinking (defined as more than 5 drinks).""Our research suggests that teenagers who have their first drink at an early age drink more heavily, on average, than those who start drinking later on,"" said Morean.""Our work also suggests that how quickly teenagers move from having their first drink to getting drunk for the first time is an important piece of the puzzle.""In total, having your first drink at a young age and quickly moving to drinking to the point of getting drunk are associated with underage alcohol use and binge drinking, which we defined as five or more drinks on an occasion in this study.""To summarise, we would expect a teenager who had his first drink at age 14, and who got drunk at 15, to be a heavier drinker than a teenager who had his first drink at age 14, and waited to get drunk until age 18,"" Morean said.""The key finding here is that both age of first use and delay from first use to first intoxication serve as risk factors for heavy drinking in adolescence,"" added William R Corbin, associate professor and director of clinical training in the department of psychology at Arizona State University The research appears in Alcoholism : Clinical & Experimental Research.",{},"['risk', 'early', 'age', 'alcohol', 'teenagers', 'drink', 'drinking', 'quickly', 'drunk', 'research', 'binge', 'linked']","- as well as the previous month's consumption of alcohol, including an assessment of the frequency of engaging in binge drinking (defined as more than 5 drinks).

Though we dont know who the buyer was, only a select group of people could reasonably afford such a splurge. As a recent New York Times article points out, if you assume no one would spend more than 1% of their net worth on a piece of art, the buyer would need to have a fortune of at least $17.9 billion.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has a net worth of $79.2 billion.Many of todays wealthiest people have made their fortunes in tech.Bill Gates, Larry Ellison , and Paul Allen are all tech moguls ranking in the top 50 of Forbes billionaire list.They are also all known to have extensive art collections worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ellison, for example, has a collection of Japanese art and artifacts that reportedly contains as many as 500 pieces. Gates, on the other hand, paid $36 million for Winslow Homer s “Lost on the Grand Banks“ in 1998. The painting hangs on a wall outside of his library, near another piece of art, Childe Hassams “Room of Flowers,“ thats worth at least $20 million.Getting a new generation involved Local galleries are hoping that the new, younger generation of tech executives follow in the footsteps of Gates and Ellison and turn their attention toward the fine arts.A recent Wealth-X report showed that California has more ultra high net worth individuals defined as people who have more than $30 million in assets than any other state in the country. 5,460 of those people live in the San Francisco city limits.

No way or the highway,"Sitting here, in an undisclosed location 502 metres away from a National Highway that wishes to remain anonymous, I want to have what Justices Jagdish Singh Kehar, Dhanandjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao were...",,2017-04-16 00:00:00,,"Sitting here, in an undisclosed location 502 metres away from a National Highway that wishes to remain anonymous, I want to have what Justices Jagdish Singh Kehar, Dhanandjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao were having when, on December 15, 2016, they passed the Supreme Court order prohibiting the sale of alcohol within 500 m of national and state highways. The other alternative would be to drink myself blotto while trying to understand, with all the sincerity I can muster on Easter, the significance of having 500 m as the Lakshman rekha for imbibing the unholy stuff. What happens within this mysterious radius? Or, rather, since this is all about preventing bad stuff from happening, what will now no longer happen within this charmed circle? The venerable Supreme Court, responding to a petition seeking the ban, has even used the reasoning of doing what the Centre had prepared in a ‘policy for alcoholic beverages and alcohol’ to dodge the bullet of ‘judicial overreach’. But that un-policied policy had mentioned turning spaces within 100 m from a state or national highway into a mini-Gujarat-Bihar. And as world record-holders Usain Bolt and David Rudisha know well, 500 m and 100 m have a 400 m farak. The judges passed the order — after much earlier passing the bar — to ostensibly clamp down on drunken driving and minimise highway accidents, for which suitably numbers, damned numbers and statistics were duly trotted to make every child sleep in this post-Gabbar world. I can only imagine the brain-movie that must have run through the venerable justices’ heads: A man procuring a bottle of the nasty stuff from a thek 323 m away from a highway. Glug-glugging half the bottle and returning to the car which he had been driving stone sober earlier. Now drunk, tyres a-squeal he sets out into the night, swerving and a potential roadrunner of a criminal driving into a tragedy. The fact that a person behind a wheel need not have been denied a drink or two or four from a source that isn’t a liquor shop near a highway may have eluded the sober heads of justice. Perhaps, having a thek or a bar 500 m away from the car, rather than from a highway, would have been more logical. For, a 500 m walk can, indeed, do wonderful stuff to clear one’s head that a 100 m Keshto Mukherjee-inspired jaunt can only dream of. The earlier court order was modified in a March 31 order that lowered the threshold from 500 m to 220 m for towns of fewer than 20,000 people. One supposes that there are less people or black buck a drunken driver who is not a Bollywood star can mow down in these places. This also gives a gentle nudge in favour of family planning, I reckon. But a Patiala peg measure of confusion is poured down my hatch when I hear that the court has exempted Meghalaya and Sikkim from the ban, since that would have meant more than 90% of shops would have to be shut down. The message I am getting in this exemption is that if Pune, with 17 state highways passing through the city, had 175,800 liquor permit holders instead of the 1,758 that it really has, Pune — and who knows, maybe Maharashtra as a whole — would also have been exempted having ‘livelihoods at stake’. Instead of planning to lay off many of their staff, standalone hotel and restaurant-owners affected by the highway booze ban should actually go on a hiring spree. That would put more livelihoods in jeopardy, and even the cold heart of justice will then hear — as it did from Meghalaya and Sikkim — plaintive sitar strains that always signify hardships in Hindi movies. But what I still can’t get my not-yet-spinning head around is the mystery of the petitioner, Harman Sidhu, a man a year older than I am, so hopefully someone I should be able to understand. Sidhu has been wheelchair-bound since a road accident in 1996. Was he hit by a drunken motorist? No. Was he a drunken driver himself who paid the price of driving under the influence? Nyet. Sidhu was reportedly in a car with two friends returning to Chandigarh from Himachal Pradesh and sitting in the back seat when the three friends spotted a leopard. They decided to “drive off road” to see if they could catch it again. But the car fell into a gorge. In his own words, there is no mention of drinking. Er, so why does the highway theka or hotel bar or liquor shop get the rap? Call it the majesty of justice akin to banning smoking, because even though the fire was caused by faulty wiring, it’s still about wanting you to quit smoking for your own good. A little dodgy logic can be forgiven when the cause is good. So what if this also means the breathalyser industry also taking a hit. And there being no need any longer in many stretches of this land of ours for a policeman to tell you to breathe into his face. Such awkwardness will be now avoided. Dear god, let me get a drink 501 m away from this highway, which I hope will very soon, inspired by the West Bengal government, be denotified and turned into an ‘arterial road’.

"Diageo would take 30 years to build United Spirits' network: Samar Singh Sheikhawat, United Breweries",It would take Diageo 30 years to build United Spirits' network,,2013-01-06 05:49:00+00:00,,"The average price of a Kingfisher quart (large bottle) is Rs 100. Today, one can buy 100 things that cost Rs 100. A tube of Colgate Total — the largest one — is over Rs 100. Farm-fresh eggs today cost more than Rs 5, or Rs 60 for a dozen. Petrol is close to Rs 80 a litre. So in that context, for a discerning target audience, a Rs 100 price point is not the reason that they will not buy a Heineken.They will not buy because of the taste. In five-star hotels, no one questions prices because ambience, decor and hopefully service justify the pricing. But when a normal restaurant charges the same, a person will complain. In Heineken’s case, a customer pays for the best packaging, the most widely sold international premium mild beer brand and a huge history of 137 years. Our stated preference is to dominate all price points in all geographies.Well, I don’t know if they will bring Guinness. The spirits business is different from the beer business. We have no connection with the two. They all happen to be owned by the same business house. We do sponsorships together. Typically, their seasonality is totally different from ours. If our sales decline during the cold months, their consumption rises. The prices are different.Also, beer from the perspective of alcohol delivery is far more expensive than spirits. A bottle of whisky — a reasonably decent brand — will cost Rs 100 for 180 ml, which contains 40% pure alcohol. That is 72 ml of alcohol for Rs 100, or 1 rupee and 33 paise for 1 ml of alcohol. In beer, 650 ml of Kingfisher Premium contains 4% alcohol. That is 27 ml of alcohol for Rs 100 — exactly the opposite of spirits. In India, people drink to get smashed. No other reason. If that is the objective, it is far cheaper and far quicker to get a buzz on spirits than on beer. Which is why revenue-wise, the spirits business is much larger than the beer industry.Volume-wise, we (UBL) are actually slightly larger than USL — in 2011, we sold 135 million cases while they sold a little lesser. But our revenues were about Rs 3,500 crore compared with their Rs 8,000 crore because the unit price of a case of spirits is far higher than that of a case of beer. So a young boy starting to drink finds it far easier and cheaper to get smashed on a bottle of 180 ml of whisky than 650 ml of beer.I can’t comment. It is too early to tell what the product portfolio of Diageo will be or how the organisational structure will pan out.Have you tasted Guinness? My theory is that it will not work in India. First, it is served at room temperature. Second, it is black. Third, it has a fruity coffee kind of taste. Indians like their beer cold. The per capita consumption of beer today in India is 1.6 litres per person per year. That is next to nothing. Now where the beer market is so small and nascent, a niche beer will take 50 years to change the scenario.You have these microbreweries and beer clubs, which are all full but none is making money. There will be a couple of 1,000 people in every city who will like to drink specially brewed beer, but the overwhelming majority prefers regular beer. Haywards had launched Haywards Black, which was something like a stout. Bombed miserably.Not necessary. For instance, just hypothetically, what if it were decided that Guinness will be distributed through the UBL network? We don’t have a Guinness kind of product in our portfolio. If we believe that there is a market for it, the best way to market is through UBL and not USL.",{},"['price', 'build', 'breweries', 'united', 'business', 'singh', 'ml', 'diageo', 'alcohol', 'guinness', 'network', 'spirits', 'samar', '100', 'beer', 'sheikhawat', 'far', '30', 'rs']","Today, one can buy 100 things that cost Rs 100.

The mystery of Japanese mirin in kitchen,"Mirin, a liquid used in Japanese cooking that is vaguely described as sweet cooking spirit, Japanese rice wine, sweet sake.",,2013-07-05 04:25:00+00:00,,"‘The Lost Blend is an O.Henry story about two men trying to rediscover an alcoholic drink they had once made by accident. They were trying to export a range of drinks to Nicaragua when they found there was a new tax on bottles, but not barrels. To avoid this they dump all their wares into two barrels and discover that the blend that results in one is undrinkable, but the other is pure ambrosia. They keep experimenting with different blends to make it again, but always fail until, in a typical O.Henry twist, they realise that the missing ingredient was what was already in the barrel - plain water! Secret ingredients are rather dubious things. When they are real they tend to be, as O.Henry suggests, really simple, just paradigm shifting (another example is Kentucky Fried Chicken where the real secret is not so much the blend of flavourings, but the pressurised frying pan used to cook the chicken). But that tiny pinch of a secret spice or the dash of flavouring from a bottle kept hidden in a cupboard? Its good for a story, and for the reputation of selfish cooks who want their secrets to go with them to their graves, but the actual value of any such ingredient to a dish is often overstated. Most of the time, unless a product is used in such quantities it is hard to conceal, it wont make a major difference. But I will admit to using one ingredient that isnt secret in the sense that I hardly conceal its use, but in that Im not sure why it works - I just know it does! This is mirin, a liquid used in Japanese cooking that is vaguely described as sweet cooking spirit, Japanese rice wine, sweet sake and other terms that leaves its exact composition unclear. It is used in dipping sauces, as an addition to stir-fries and in marinades, particularly for fish since it has a reputation for removing unpleasant fishy odours. It can even be drunk by itself, and apparently in some parts of Japan on Shogatsu, the traditional Japanese New Year, it is the custom to drink a concoction of herbs steeped in old-style alcoholic mirin. This is not something you are likely to be able to make at home since getting really alcoholic mirin is now hard. Hiroko Shimbos The Japanese Kitchen explains that the reasons for this lie in the rice shortages in Japan during and after the Second World War. What rice was available was either eaten directly or brewed into more potent sake (or distilled to shochu) while making mirin, which was mostly used as a condiment, was lower priority. Instead, alternatives were devised using alcohol, water, sugar and salt and these concoctions were OK for cooking, but not drinking. Since these were much cheaper than real mirin, people just continued using them for cooking and demand for real mirin dropped. Today what you are most likely to find is this fake mirin, which is called aji mirin or mirin fo-chomiryo which means mirin-like seasoning. Connoisseurs of Japanese food disdain this and it is worth looking for mirin actually made from rice, like the Rice Mirin sold under the Clearspring brand. Tasting this alongside the more anonymous stuff, you get a clearly more chemical taste from the latter, but to be honest, this isnt really detectable in cooking. You can also get more complex styles of mirin like the Mikawa Mirin, also sold by Clearspring, which is made in a more traditional way and aged, and here the taste is much more interestingly complex and detectable.",{},"['kitchen', 'mystery', 'real', 'using', 'mirin', 'secret', 'ohenry', 'cooking', 'really', 'used', 'japanese', 'rice']","This is mirin, a liquid used in Japanese cooking that is vaguely described as sweet cooking spirit, Japanese rice wine, sweet sake and other terms that leaves its exact composition unclear.

United Breweries Director Details - The Economic Times,United Breweries Director Information - Get the latest information about Directors of United Breweries on The Economic Times,,None,,"Directors  Report The Directors have pleasure in presenting this Annual Report on the business and operations of the Company and the audited accounts of United Breweries Limited ( UBL  or  your Company  or  the Company ) for the financial year ended March 31, 2018 ( the year under review ,  the year  or  FY18 ). Financial performance for the year ended March 31, 2018 is summarized below: (Amounts in Rupees million) FINANCIAL RESULTS Year ended March 31 2018 2017 Gross Turnover 124,266 102,282 Net Turnover 56,170 47,341 Other Income 130 516 EBITDA 9,141 6,928 Depreciation and amortization 2,596 2,870 EBIT 6,545 4,058 Interest 477 587 Profit before Taxation 6,068 3,472 Provision for Taxation (2,128) (1,178) Profit after Tax available for appropriation 3,940 2,293 Appropriations: Dividend on Equity Shares (including taxes thereon) 366 366 Transfer to the General Reserve 394 229 Other Comprehensive Income 31 25 Balance your Directors propose to carry to the Balance Sheet 3,149 1,673 Total appropriations 3,940 2,293 The Gross turnover of UBL grew by 21% on account of increased volume, higher realizations, favorable state and brand mix as well as price increase in certain markets during the year. The Net turnover increased by 19%. EBITDA for the year under review stood at Rs.9,141 million as compared to Rs.6,928 million in the previous year, reflecting an increase of 32%. Depreciation for the year was Rs.2,596 million as compared to Rs.2,870 million in the previous year. Growth in operating profit was achieved by implementing strict cost control, higher capacity utilization and remedial measures taken to mitigate the negative impact of Goods and Services Tax where possible. Robust cost initiatives helped in eliminating unproductive costs which resulted in better margins. Interest cost decreased by 19% due to better working capital management and lower debt levels, as well as lower interest rates. Profit before Taxation for the year stood at Rs.6,068 million as compared to Rs.3,471 million in the previous year, reflecting an increase of 75%. Profit after Taxation stood at Rs.3,940 million as against Rs.2,293 million in the previous year. _DIVIDEND_ We take pleasure in proposing a dividend of Rs.2 per Equity Share of Re.1/- each for the year ended March 31, 2018. The dividend declared for the previous year was Rs.1.15 per Equity Share of Re.1/- each. The total dividend (including dividend tax) is Rs.638 million, which amounts to about 16% of the Profit after Tax. _RESERVES_ UBL proposes to transfer Rs.394 million to the General Reserve. _capital_ The Authorized Share Capital of the Company stands at Rs.9,990 million, comprising Equity Share Capital of Rs.4,130 million and Preference Share Capital of Rs.5,860 million. The Issued, Subscribed and Paid-up Share Capital of the Company as on March 31, 2018 remains unchanged at Rs.264.4 million comprising 26,44,05,149 Equity Shares of Re.1/- each. _management discussion and analysis_ Industry Overview During FY18 your Company delivered robust financial results despite significant regulatory hurdles and challenges faced by the Industry as a whole. In specific, the ban on sale of liquor on highways, lagging effects of demonetization, as well as increases in excise duties and changes in the route-to-market by certain States were several impediments against growth. Further, implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) effective July 01, 2017 contributed to increased input costs. The most significant regulatory change was the introduction of the highway ban, which came into effect on April 01, 2017 and impacted growth in the first quarter of the year in particular. In the second quarter, some relief came from a Supreme Court clarification that States could de-notify highways passing through city limits, such that the ban would not apply to outlets located within city limits. This clarification resulted in a recovery of the industry and growth in sales volume. Over the last five years, on an average, the beer industry recorded a steady growth of about 7% in volume terms. The per capita consumption of beer in India has increased by about 30% during that period. Given the favourable demographics in India, higher disposable income and affordability, changing cultural attitudes and a young, increasingly affluent population, consumption of beer is set to continue the steady growth pattern going forward. According to research by CISION, the Indian beer market is projected to grow at a CAGR over 7.6% during the period 2018-2024 driven by these factors. The beer industry in India remains highly regulated with high taxation and government intervention in trade. In many parts of the country, wholesale and/or retail distribution is controlled by State Government monopolies. Also in over 60% of the markets, the respective State Government dictates the price at which beer can be sold. From time to time, significant regulatory restrictions and changes including prohibition pose a great challenge to the Industry as a whole. Conservative government policies, licensing regulations, restrictions on the sale of alcohol in certain states and a preference towards hard liquor are key reasons for the relatively slow development of India s beer market. With about 2 liter per capita, beer consumption is extremely low as compared to above 21 liters in other Asian countries. Spirits like whisky, vodka, brandy and rum are highly preferred by consumers in India. However, a growing segment of consumers is shifting towards beer owing to its lower alcohol content. Whilst the strong beer segment far exceeds the mild beer segment in terms of volume, mild beer is expected to outperform the strong beer segment in terms of growth, driven by health-conscious consumers and moderate drinkers who opt for lower alcohol content. Off-trade contributes a significant share of the volume of the industry on account of more reasonable pricing as compared to the on-trade. However, on-trade channels are anticipated to exhibit high growth rates in the coming years, owing to rising income levels. Canned beer is gaining momentum as it is easier to handle and can be easily transported from one place to another. Moreover, freshly brewed, on-tap beer is demonstrating healthy growth. There has been a trend of emerging brew pubs in large cities such as Bengaluru, Pune and Gurgaon over the last few years. These outlets have introduced consumers to new types of beers, e.g. wheat beer and India Pale Ale. During the FY 2017-18 your Company added about 1.5% market share over the previous year volume and grew by 10%. This was the first double-digit volume growth since FY 2010-11. UBL s sales volume improved in key profitable markets, with strong market share gains in most large states across the country, especially in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orrisa, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Kingfisher Premium Lager and Kingfisher Strong continued to add market share in their respective categories. Your Company s super premium brands continued to be among the fastest growing brands in the country, fueled by Ultra, Ultra Max, Heineken and a range of imported beer brands. Benefiting from a strong brand portfolio, established infrastructure, a highly skilled and dedicated workforce and several other factors, your Company continues to outperform the industry. Impact of Goods and Services Tax Goods and Services Tax (GST) was made effective on July 01, 2017. GST is a destination based tax on consumption of goods and services levied at all stages right from manufacture up to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at the previous stages available for setoff. The Central GST and the State GST are levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except on exempted goods and services. The Government has kept alcoholic beverage industry outside the purview of GST. Since input materials used by UBL attract GST, it has resulted in higher tax incidence on input materials pushing up our cost of production with no tax credit availability. This has also resulted in a cascading effect on the profits of your Company. The Management, however, has actively mitigated the negative impact through better commercial negotiation with the suppliers. Sales and Marketing UBL continues to lead in the Indian Beer market, with a volume that is more than twice that of its nearest competitor. Kingfisher Strong continues to be the single largest brand in the Indian beer market with sales recording more than 100 million cases for the first time. Kingfisher Premium continues to be the first choice of mild beer consumers across the country. The super-premium brands in our portfolio viz., Kingfisher Ultra, Kingfisher Ultra Max and Heineken are the top three fastest growing brands in the Indian market. These brands have been established in India as world class super premium beer brands. Kingfisher Ultra and Kingfisher Ultra Max are associated with Fashion and Style platform. Ultra Shorts web series had several stories and episodes released with combined views of over 30 million. Heineken, one of the fastest growing brands in UBL s portfolio, has established itself as India s most premium brand. It leverages the Global marketing platforms of Football (UEFA Champions League), by associating with James Bond and Music. We have also created a highly successful India specific digital film for Heineken which achieved 20 million views across platforms. The Company continues sustainable investment in brand building activities for Kingfisher in the fields of Sports, Food, Fashion and Music. We have a significant and market leading presence in the Indian Premier League T20 Cricket Tournament, the Indian Super League Football tournament, Kingfisher East Bengal Football Club and the Sunburn EDM festival. Our association with restaurants, bars, pubs, clubs and star hotels is uninterrupted. We have additional digital and television communication around the food platform with three interesting films. The Kingfisher Calendar continues to maintain its high aspiration value. We have created excitement around this property and leveraged it on digital platforms in a large way. We have also launched Pitchers, India s leading Nightlife App, in Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune. We have also launched a highly differentiated and exciting new beer brand, Kingfisher Storm. The brand has been received very favourably by consumers and has achieved 1 million cases  sales in its first year. Going ahead, as we roll out to other markets, the prospects for this brand are very promising. Catering to the growing demand for a premium, strong quality beer in the Indian market, your Company recently launched the iconic Dutch beer brand Amstel, a new International super premium strong beer in the Indian market. Amstel is a slow brewed and extra matured lager, internationally appreciated for its quality and enjoyed in over 100 countries across the globe. This launch brings another major imported brand into the UBL product portfolio. Currently launched in Karnataka, Amstel will be available pan-India in current financial year. Supply chain Our manufacturing expenses for the FY18 amounted to Rs.26,412 million, representing 21% of sales, as against Rs.21,942 million in the previous financial year, which also constituted 21% of sales. This has been achieved through tight cost control in the manufacturing process in an environment of relatively high inflation. Bottles remain our biggest cost element. Our decision to move to dedicated bottles with Trade Mark and design registration has ensured tight control on the cost of recycled bottles. In our endeavour towards reducing our environmental impact, we have adopted NNPB technology (less weight, less energy, less environmental impact) in about two-third of our new bottle purchases, which allows the company to source new bottles with reduced weight, better distribution of glass and with this the Company has got bottles at a reduced price, better stability and lower breakages. Barley-malt is the basic raw material in the manufacture of beer. Barley prices in India fluctuate widely and availability is also scarce. Apart from procuring Barley-malt locally, your Company also imports barley from other countries to meet the demand. Key material imports for the Heineken brand (bottles & labels) have now been localized and substituted with Heineken approved local vendors. This has ensured lower procurement cost and greater flexibility of sourcing. Softening of commodity prices coupled with better negotiations have helped us contain prices. We are continuing our efforts to develop new varieties of barley in association with leading Government Institutes. We work with farmers in helping them cultivate barley and provide them with good quality seeds and offer a package of good practices in order to increase productivity. Research and Development UBL s Research and Development function continues to support our growth strategy with focus on new capabilities, development of new products, enhancement of existing products, productivity improvement and cost reduction. Human Resources Employees are your Company s biggest and most valuable asset. UBL provides a congenial working environment which enables success through ownership, camaraderie, freedom of thought and action. We nurture our human resources through mentoring, coaching, learning & development programs etc. We believe in celebrating milestones, both big and small and encourages its employees to connect, communicate and collaborate through various platforms enabled by the Company. We have employee friendly policies viz., leave, travel, medical etc. which keeps UBL employees happy and productive. The talent pool is refreshed from time to time by infusing new hires from premier colleges of the Country.

Your Company, as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), works with the communities residing near its breweries as a starting point. Your Company has integrated CSR in its corporate strategy and intends to drive it with a vision to bring about sustainable social development for its co-communities.

Through this initiative, we have been successful in providing access to safe drinking water to nearly 75,600 individuals in these villages. Another project has been launched in Mysore, Karnataka. Until now, your Company has reached out to 59 villages covering nearly 1.54 lac individuals. In addition to implementing rainwater harvesting and watershed management projects in and around our breweries, we have also undertaken recycling of the treated waste water within the breweries. With extensive measures, the practice of harvesting rainwater has been extended to the nearby communities by incorporating the necessary infrastructure. Your Company intends to be a Water Neutral Organization by 2025 and our efforts have been focused in this direction. We initiated new projects in Haryana, Punjab and Karnataka. Ponds have been adopted for rejuvenation in these states and in Karnataka, rooftop rainwater harvesting has been undertaken in several houses in villages around Nandi hills. In our efforts to recharge the freshwater consumed by our breweries, by March 2018, we were able to recharge 53% water. Our water conservation efforts have resulted in the recharge of over 25,61,930 KL water per year. UBL s initiatives in the field of education have been in tandem with its endeavors to enhance the educational experience and improve the quality of primary education for children, especially from the underprivileged sections. Our breweries across the country have adopted neighboring Government schools and supported them in meeting their requirements on a regular basis. In addition to this, we have focused education projects being implemented in Rajasthan and Karnataka. Your Company s efforts in certain backward regions of Alwar, Rajasthan have been concentrated towards giving a facelift to 10 Government Schools in terms of infrastructure and gradually to improve the teaching-learning experience.

Sustainability UBL s sustainability reporting articulates its perspective on the emerging forces in the global sustainability landscape and UBL s response on multiple dimensions. For each of the three dimensions i.e. economic, ecological and social sustainability, we articulate key issues as well as opportunities that emerge and update our engagements. Towards sustainability, UBL has undertaken proactive measures in water consumption, rain water harvesting and reduction in energy consumption thereby reducing the carbon foot print, energy and fuel consumption. Your Company has adopted various energy saving measures by switching over to renewable sources of energy. During FY18, the Company generated 22,11,539 units of electricity from the roof top solar power plants set up at Mallepally (near Hyderabad), Aurangabad , Mumbai, Srikakulam and Dharuhera (Haryana) breweries. Further, your Company has started utilizing wind power at breweries located at Bengaluru, Mangalore and Mysore to the tune of around 71% of the total power consumption at these breweries. A total of 1,29,55,000 units from wind power was wheeled in to these breweries in this financial year. Your company started utilizing wind power at breweries located near Chennai. A total of 26,67,600 units from wind power was wheeled into these breweries in this financial year. On account of the shift from conventional sources to renewable energy, UBL has achieved a carbon foot print reduction to the tune of 15,159 tonnes of carbon di-oxide. The overall renewable energy contribution for FY18 out of the total power consumption stands at 15.36% for our own breweries and 12.88% of the total power consumption for own and contract breweries. UBL is in the process of rolling out its first Sustainability Report in the current financial year and the same will be posted on the website of the Company.

In India, beer account for very low share of consumption compared to other alcohol products. Such low consumption along with cultural change, higher disposable income and demographics offers a great opportunity. While Indian beer industry presents considerable opportunities for growth, the overall growth is slowed down due to heavy regulatory environment, lack of retail formalization, restrictions in trade, negative industry tag, etc. For the States, one of the easiest ways to get higher revenue is to increase tax and duties on liquor products resulting into higher end consumer prices, thereby impacting growth. Government regulations in particular pose a significant risk to the overall alcohol market in India, including for beer. Examples include the ban imposed by the Supreme Court on sale of liquor within half a kilometre of state and national highways, prohibition imposed in Bihar effective April 2016 followed by ban on exports imposed in April 2017. Higher duties imposed by States on liquor also remains a major concern which is beyond the control of the manufacturers. Despite these challenges, favourable demographics of India is attracting foreign brewers to invest in beer market in the country. The combination of two international brewers in India recently has the potential to pose stiff competition. However, your Company is adequately protected from these risks and concerns due to its robust brand portfolio and a loyal consumer base. Emerging Craft Beer Culture - Influenced by trends from Europe and the US, India is rapidly developing its own craft beer culture with brands such as Bira 91 becoming popular among Indian consumers. Although India s craft beer industry is still nascent, the craft beer segment and demand for premium beer in general is estimated to be growing at a strong double digit rate albeit from a low base. Your Company is preparing a craft and variety beer offering of its own to capture growth in this segment. Also, the concept of microbreweries is growing rapidly in the country. So far only a few States have issued licenses for microbreweries. However, with tremendously growing consumer demand for craft beer, other States are also planning to allow microbreweries in their regions. Whilst the beer market continues to expand, your Company is looking at the larger beverage consumption occasions to further drive the growth of the business. For most adults the beverage choices for non-alcoholic occasions are limited. We have been working on tapping into this opportunity with a portfolio of non-alcoholic beers that deliver on refreshment and taste. These new offerings will also enable us to enter a much larger retail universe that is today closed to us. Our new offerings will be produced at our brewery in Bihar and are scheduled to be test marketed commencing the 3rd quarter of the current financial year. A separate vertical has been created to drive this business in a focused manner so as to unlock its full potential. We see this business contributing significantly to the company in the years to come. Whilst these type of products have been introduced by beer companies around the world, your Company will be a pioneer in India. Prospects With a market share of about 52%, UBL continues to remain a market leader in the beer industry in India. Young demographics with 50% of the population below 25 years of age and 65% below the age of 35 years, changing culture and very low per capita consumption are key drivers of growth of beer in India. The industry has been expanding regularly and it is expected that the next year too, the Industry will grow by about 6 to 8%. UBL shall continue its focus on innovative and effective marketing to lead the market. Your Company is hopeful of outperforming the industry in 2018-19 as well. Growth in premium retail trade and on premise outlets in metropolitan cities has increased the range of beers and improved the retail environment. In a few States, the Government has issued separate licenses for sale of beer in super markets which signals good growth prospects for the industry. Innovative introductions also help in penetrating untapped markets and your Company s new introductions have fared well. Effective marketing strategies have helped us reinforce our position as the clear market leader in the Country. Our flagship brand, Kingfisher is almost synonymous with beer in India. UBL continues to invest significantly in brand visibility to sustain high recall for its brands amongst consumers. High profile sponsorships and brand activations have ensured that its brands, especially Kingfisher, retain their iconic status. The Company has a strong route-to-market, combined with a portfolio of market leading brands. UBL also continues to invest in both, capacities and brands. Even in a highly competitive market, your Company has not only successfully overcome the challenges of the industry, but also outpaced several global beer brands that have entered India in the recent past and has constantly maintained its leadership position. Risk Management Your Company has in place a robust framework for managing and mitigating various risks. Considering the risks affecting the beer industry, UBL continuously assesses and updates the risk management framework based on changes in the level of risk. To achieve this control, UBL performs risk assessment in which Strategic, Operational, Information Technology, Financial and other Risks are analysed. This is reviewed regularly by the Internal Audit team, Risk Management Committee and the Board. The Management Committee meets regularly to address various risks and mitigation thereof. UBL has evolved a framework for management of business risks. We periodically assess risks in the internal and external environment, along with the potential cost of the risks and incorporate risk management plans in our strategy, business and operational plans. UBL has explored a variety of avenues to contain the risk of continued increase in basic costs and has entered into a few long term agreements for sourcing vital inputs. There has been a continuous review of the long term strategy for procurement at an economical cost. As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives, UBL has committed to availability of safe drinking water for communities residing in the vicinity of each of its 21 owned breweries. We have been continuously working towards water conservation and minimizing water waste by recycling to the extent possible. All our breweries have rainwater harvesting systems in place. From a consumption level of about 6 litres of water per litre of beer produced about a decade ago, we are at a level of about 3.24 litres per litre of beer today. This is lower than the world average of about 4 litres. Some of our newer breweries are at a level of 2.5-2.8 litres of water per litre of beer. This would place your Company amongst the elite of world breweries in the area of water consumption. UBL has constituted a Risk Management Committee comprising senior Board members. The Committee reviews the risk impact matrix comprising strategic, preventable, external, internal, operational and compliance risks associated with business objectives and the actions taken to address these risks. Mitigation plans for such risks are in place and are reviewed periodically. Further, the Assurance Committee comprising functional Heads, reviews identified risks and takes mitigating actions on a quarterly basis. The Company has formulated a Risk Management Policy and has laid down procedures for risk assessment, identification, minimization and mitigation which are presented to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors on a periodical basis. Internal control System UBL has established a robust system of Internal Controls to ensure that assets are safeguarded and transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded and reported. With the introduction of Internal Controls in Financial Reporting (ICFR) in the Act, we have made an evaluation of functioning and quality of internal controls. The Internal Financial Control framework of your Company is established in accordance with COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations) framework and is commensurate with the size and operations of your Company s business. In addition to statutory mandate, Internal Audit evaluates and provides assurance of its adequacy and effectiveness through periodic reporting. Controls in place are routinely evaluated and certified by the Internal and Statutory Auditors and gaps are identified by the Auditors through a detailed testing exercise. The process of internal control ensures orderly and efficient conduct of business, safeguarding of assets, prevention and detection of frauds and errors, accuracy and completeness of accounting records and timely preparation of reliable financial information. Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of the Significant Accounting Policies that are carefully selected by management. The Accounting Policies are reviewed and updated from time to time. These, in turn are supported by a set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that have been established for the business. The SOPs and controls are reviewed by management and audited periodically. Internal Control evaluates adequacy of segregation of duties, transparency in authorization of transactions, adequacy of records and documents, accountability & safeguarding of assets and reliability of the management information system. Periodic reviews are carried out for identification of control deficiencies and opportunities for bridging gaps with best practices along with formalization of action plans to minimize risks. The Company believes that the overall internal control system is dynamic and reflects the current requirements at all times thereby ensuring that appropriate procedures and operating and monitoring practices are in place. _OTHER INFORMATION_ Subsidiary company Maltex Malsters Limited is the only subsidiary in which your Company holds 51% of equity capital.

"Travis Kalanick: The fall of Travis Kalanick was a lot weirder and darker than you thought, Auto News, ET Auto","A common factor in all crises was Kalanick’s unrelenting combativeness. Over time, he turned a lot of friends into enemies with stories to tell.",,None,,"A year ago, before the investor lawsuits and the federal investigations, before the mass resignations, and before the connotation of the word “ Uber ” shifted from “world’s most valuable startup” to “world’s most dysfunctional,” Uber’s executives sat around a hotel conference room table in San Francisco , trying to convince their chief executive officer, Travis Kalanick , that the company had a major problem: him.The executives were armed that day with something unusual for Uber Technologies Inc.: the results of a survey. Kalanick operated by gut feeling and with a stubborn sense of how people should feel, not how they did. Jeff Jones, Uber’s new president and former chief marketing officer for Target Corp. , wanted more substantial insights. As usual with Kalanick, the discussion grew contentious. Jones and his deputies argued that Uber’s riders and drivers viewed the company as made up of a bunch of greedy, self-centered jerks. And as usual, Kalanick retorted that the company had a public-relations problem, not a cultural one.Then a top executive excused herself to answer a phone call. A minute later, she reappeared and asked Kalanick to step into the hallway. Another executive joined them. They hunched over a laptop to watch a video that had just been posted online by Bloomberg News: grainy, black-and-white dashcam footage of Kalanick in the back seat of an UberBlack on Super Bowl weekend, heatedly arguing over fares with a driver named Fawzi Kamel.“Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own shit!” Kalanick can be heard yelling at Kamel. “They blame everything in their life on somebody else!”As the clip ended, the three stood in stunned silence. Kalanick seemed to understand that his behavior required some form of contrition. According to a person who was there, he literally got down on his hands and knees and began squirming on the floor. “This is bad,” he muttered. “I’m terrible.”Then, contrition period over, he got up, called a board member, demanded a new PR strategy, and embarked on a yearlong starring role as the villain who gets his comeuppance in the most gripping startup drama since the dot-com bubble. It’s a story that, until now, has never been fully told.On Jan. 27 the newly inaugurated president issued his executive order imposing border restrictions on people from seven Muslim countries. Outrage erupted. People took to the streets; tech workers in Silicon Valley walked out of their offices in symbolic protest. And in New York, a small union called the New York Taxi Workers Alliance declared that there would be no taxi pickups from 6 pm to 7 pm on Saturday night at John F. Kennedy International Airport.For Uber, that would create extra demand at the airport, which meant it could charge more—but this would probably cause a backlash. So the New York managers decided to be good citizens and suspend surge pricing for the night. The backlash hit anyway. After years of negative revelations—spying on passengers, dubious driverless-car experiments in San Francisco, the CEO’s bragging about sexual conquests, to name just a few—the public was already inclined to believe the worst of Uber.Lyft Inc., the rival service that branded itself the anti-Uber, capitalized on the moment and donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union.Further stoking the flames was Kalanick’s decision to join Trump’s business advisory council. Kalanick argued that his participation in the council wasn’t an endorsement of the president; he just wanted a seat at the table, along with Elon Musk, International Business Machines Corp.’s Ginni Rometty, and Walt Disney Co.’s Bob Iger. Ultimately, Kalanick decided the whole thing wasn’t worth the trouble and his minders set up a call so he could politely say no to Trump. The conversation apparently went as one would expect. Kalanick emerged to tell his colleagues that the president was “super un-pumped.”In mid-February, an engineer named Susan Fowler penned a blog post, “Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber,” about the sexual harassment she had witnessed in her time at the company. The explosive response to that post prompted Kalanick to hire Eric Holder Jr., the former US attorney general and a partner at the firm Covington & Burling LLP, to lead an investigation into Fowler’s claims. But the hits kept coming. The infamous dashcam footage surfaced; a few weeks later, the New York Times reported on a secret Uber technology called Greyball, which the company developed to identify and deny service to riders who had violated the company’s contractual terms. In some cities and countries, Uber managers used Greyball to avoid picking up taxi inspectors and other law enforcement officials who might want to ticket drivers or shut the service down.A common factor in all these crises was Kalanick’s unrelenting combativeness. Over time, he turned a lot of friends into enemies with stories to tell. Jones, the president who had commissioned the public survey, resigned in March after only six months on the job, citing differences over “beliefs and approach to leadership.”Google, too, should have been an ally. The company invested in Uber in 2013 and, four years later, owned a stake worth billions. But the two companies began to look more like competitors as both raced to build selfdriving cars. What might have remained a friendly rivalry soured irrevocably when Uber bought the self-driving trucking startup Otto for more than $600 million in stock. Most of Otto’s core employees were former Googlers, led by their own brash co-founder, Anthony Levandowski. Google co-founder Larry Page had already grown to loathe Kalanick. Now he was fuming.Google filed a lawsuit in late February, accusing Uber of stealing its secrets. Its allegations were devastating, the most damning one being that Levandowski had downloaded 14,000 Google files before he quit to start Otto.The legal fight, expected to go to trial shortly, may have been avoided if Kalanick had listened to his senior executives. Meanwhile, private investigators hired to conduct due diligence on Otto before the acquisition closed learned that Levandowski had possessed five disks of data from Google’s driverless effort and other information that included “source code, design files, laser files, engineering documents and software related to Google self-driving cars,” according to the investigators.Kalanick, who says he never read the investigators’ report, went forward with the deal anyway. And he agreed to protect Levandowski from legal attacks by Google. Then, after Google filed its lawsuit, Levandowski told the court he was likely to invoke the Fifth Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination. He would no longer help defend Uber, further imperilling the company’s case. But Kalanick insisted that the company stick by Levandowski.Kalanick was unable or unwilling to right himself. If anything, his judgment deteriorated. He decided that he should apologize privately to Kamel, the driver he berated on video. The plan was simple: meet with Kamel at some neutral and nonthreatening location, engage in five minutes of pleasantries, say sorry, and leave.The meeting went on for more than an hour, with Kalanick re-debating Kamel over Uber’s pricing policies. By the end, Kalanick suggested that he give the driver Uber stock, according to people familiar with the discussion.Wayne Ting, who ran Uber’s San Francisco business, was in the room with Kalanick and Kamel. In an email later circulated among employees and directors, Ting said he was deeply disturbed by what he saw. In the email, he wrote that Kalanick “no longer had the moral standing” to lead Uber. After Uber’s lawyers insisted the company wouldn’t pay Kamel to clean up Kalanick’s personal scandal, Kalanick agreed to pay Kamel $200,000 out of his own pocket, according to a person familiar with the matter.In late March, the tech publication the Information published an account of a visit by Kalanick and other Uber executives to a karaoke bar in Seoul in 2014. Kalanick’s then girlfriend Gabi Holzwarth, who went along on the work trip, told the Information that the bar was staffed by “escorts,” each woman labelled with a number so customers could pick them out more easily. (Holzwarth said she and Kalanick left the bar together after about an hour.) In June, Bloomberg News and the tech blog Recode reported that Eric Alexander, Uber’s president for Asia-Pacific, had obtained and carried around the confidential medical record from a horrific December 2014 rape of a 26-year-old passenger by an Uber driver in Delhi. Alexander, Kalanick, and other executives had discussed among themselves a preposterous theory—that the rape may have been a setup by Ola, Uber’s primary rival in India. The Asia news—especially the India revelations—resonated as loudly inside Uber as outside. “It was like a bomb went off inside the company,” said one senior exec.A short time later, six members of Uber’s ELT, or Executive Leadership Team, sent a confidential letter to the board. The letter, according to a person familiar with the matter, asked for an independent board chairman to be appointed and for accountability at the highest levels of the company. They demanded the board force Kalanick to take at least a three-month leave of absence.Over the years, Kalanick had a simple method for dealing with Bill Gurley, one of his earliest backers and board members. Kalanick told colleagues that all he had to do was ignore Gurley’s phone calls and Gurley would call less often. The silent treatment never seemed to bother Gurley much. A tall, affable Texan and a partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, he often appeared at conferences and on television evangelizing Uber and praising the entrepreneurial abilities of its CEO. In 2016, along with the rest of Uber’s board, he turned over more control to Kalanick as part of a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.As 2017 wore on, Kalanick became even less communicative than normal. He was regularly missing or cancelling leadership team meetings and wasn’t delivering on his declaration, made in a public letter, to hire “a Chief Operating Officer: a peer who can partner with me to write the next chapter in our journey.” In March, after years of trying, Gurley finally got himself appointed to the board’s audit committee and learned of the steep losses in Uber’s subprime vehicle-leasing division, which helped its drivers finance cars.Gurley’s cheerleading turned into anxiety and then horror. People at Benchmark worried that the Uber situation was affecting Gurley’s health.By the time the six executives sent their letter to the board urging that Kalanick take a leave of absence, Gurley was ready to consider it. The directors met on Sunday, June 11, at the Los Angeles offices of Holder’s law firm, Covington & Burling. They reviewed Holder’s report, which detailed not only a sequence of sexual harassment incidents at the company but also a culture of legal noncompliance that systematically equated rule-following with bureaucracy and failure. The board voted to adopt Holder’s 47 recommendations, including rewriting Uber’s absurdly bro-ish cultural values (“toe stepping,” “always be hustlin’”), restricting the consumption of alcohol at company events, and instituting an anonymous complaint process for employees.There was no discussion about asking Kalanick to resign, but the board agreed to a temporary sabbatical for the CEO, on his own terms. Kalanick was grieving from a recent family tragedy—his mother, Bonnie, was killed and his father, Donald, seriously injured in a boating accident in Fresno, Calif.Two days later, Arianna Huffington, the media entrepreneur and Kalanick’s staunchest ally on the board, led an all-hands meeting at Uber’s Market Street headquarters in San Francisco, announcing the board’s recommendations and Kalanick’s leave of absence. A 16-member committee of senior execs would run the company and institute a round of image-repairing changes.But employees and board members never stopped feeling his presence. Even in top-level conversations where Kalanick appeared to be absent, other executives and board members suspected that Huffington was serving as his proxy. The founder of the Huffington Post was a constant presence at Uber’s offices, making suggestions that seemed to promote her new wellness company, Thrive Global Holdings LLC. For example, she wanted to put “nap pods” at driver hubs and give drivers meditation wristbands. Huffington’s company received $50,000 in consulting fees from Uber.In a meeting at the firm’s offices in Woodside, Calif., a few days after Kalanick went on leave, Gurley and his partners came to a decision: Kalanick had to go, for good. They quietly reached out to other investors—First Round Capital, Menlo Ventures, Fidelity Investments, and Lowercase Capital—which all called meetings of their respective partnerships. Five signed a letter imploring Kalanick to resign.On June 20, Benchmark dispatched two partners, Matt Cohler and Peter Fenton, to confront Kalanick in Chicago, where he was interviewing Walter Robb, the former co-CEO of Whole Foods Market Inc., for the open COO spot. The venture capitalists surprised Kalanick at the Ritz-Carlton hotel and asked for his resignation as CEO and to relinquish the board seats he controlled. Cohler and Fenton told Kalanick he had a few hours before they went public with their allegations. They also said that if he resigned, they would tell the world he had quit on his own terms.To their surprise Kalanick signed the documents at the Ritz in Chicago. The New York Times ran a detailed story about the resignation, infuriating Kalanick. What he believed was going to be a graceful departure now looked like the Benchmark-administered ouster it actually was.Kalanick reneged on his agreement to let go of his board seat and the two others he controlled. And although he no longer came into the office, Kalanick managed to keep himself in the middle of the company’s affairs. He lobbied for his own pick as successor, former General Electric Co. chief Jeffrey Immelt. The Uber directors would have none of that. Kalanick also flew to Seattle to interview a wild-card candidate referred by investor TPG: Expedia Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi Somehow, amid the dysfunction, Uber hired Khosrowshahi, who impressed the board with a thoughtful PowerPoint presentation that included a slide that read, “There can be only one CEO at a time.” Khosrowshahi was all that Kalanick wasn’t or couldn’t be: humble, a good listener, and a diplomat. In a pointed reversal of Kalanick’s mantra, he would say: “We don’t have a PR problem; we have an ‘us’ problem—we have behaved poorly.” And when the city of London revoked Uber’s operating license in September, Khosrowshahi visited, met with taxi regulators, and published an open letter. “On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologize,” he wrote. “We will appeal this decision on behalf of millions of Londoners, but we do so with the knowledge that we must also change.”Kalanick has privately told people he thought the apology tour was a mistake. But his opinion no longer matters—Uber’s new COO, Barney Harford, says he was hired without ever meeting him. The SoftBank deal will make Kalanick a billionaire. Friends say he’s trying to keep busy. He’s setting up a family office and spending time with his father in Los Angeles. And he’s getting very good at 2048, the single-player smartphone puzzle game.",{},"['uber', 'lot', 'thought', 'auto', 'ubers', 'executives', 'kamel', 'darker', 'went', 'travis', 'kalanicks', 'board', 'kalanick', 'president', 'fall', 'company', 'et', 'weirder']","Kalanick operated by gut feeling and with a stubborn sense of how people should feel, not how they did.

Govt to move SC against Salman's acquittal : Pleader tells HC,Bollywood super star Salman Khan may face fresh trouble with the Maharashtra Government today informing the Bombay High Court of its decision to challenge in the Supreme Court.,,2015-12-23 19:58:00+00:00,,"MUMBAI: Bollywood super star Salman Khan may face fresh trouble with the Maharashtra Government today informing the Bombay High Court of its decision to challenge in the Supreme Court the verdict acquitting him of all charges in the 2002 hit-and-run case. The Government told the High Court that a Special Leave Petition (SLP) will be moved in the apex court against the December 10 verdict of Justice A R Joshi, who overturned the sessions court judgement that held Salman guilty and sentenced him to five years imprisonment. Government Pleader Abhinandan Vagyani informed a bench that the Law and Judiciary department had accorded sanction to file a SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the High Court verdict which had acquitted Salman, ruling that shoddy investigations were conducted by police in the case. The SLP would be filed in due course, the pleader said during a hearing of a public interest litigation filed by journalist Nikhil Wagle, seeking compensation from Salman for the victims of the 2002 hit-and-run case. Though the actor had deposited compensation almost a decade ago for the families of victims as directed by the HC, Wagles petition is still being heard as the court expanded its scope to include the issues of enhancement of punishment in drink driving cases and forensic procedures adopted by the authorities to determine consumption of alcohol by accused. On May 6, a sessions court had sentenced the actor to five years jail after it held him guilty of offences including culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Aggrieved, he filed an appeal in HC which acquitted him. According to the prosecution, on September 28, 2002, Salman had rammed his car into a bakery in suburban Bandra, killing one person and injuring four others who were sleeping outside. The case had generated a great deal of public interest in drink driving cases. The PIL filed by Nikhil Wagle also raised issues about enhancing the punishment prescribed in law in such cases resulting in Union Government informing the HC last week that it was mulling to amend laws to increase punishment so that it can serve as deterrent. Meanwhile, some social activists and legal experts welcomed the Government decision to move the Supreme Court to challenge the HC verdict. Former DGP D Sivanandan termed this decision as ""one in tandem with the public perception."" He said there were many samaritans who wanted justice for the person who died in the mishap and also for late Ravindra Patil, police constable and bodyguard of Salman who had implicated the actor in the case. Lawyer and human Rights Activist Abha Singh, who raised several questions during the trial on behalf of an intervenor in the case, said ""this decision of the state to appeal in Supreme Court will certainly clear the conflicting issues and ensure that justice is done in this case.",{},"['salman', 'public', 'punishment', 'filed', 'tells', 'decision', 'salmans', 'acquittal', 'court', 'slp', 'govt', 'verdict', 'pleader', 'supreme', 'sc', 'hc']","Government Pleader Abhinandan Vagyani informed a bench that the Law and Judiciary department had accorded sanction to file a SLP in the Supreme Court challenging the High Court verdict which had acquitted Salman, ruling that shoddy investigations were conducted by police in the case.

UB Group minus Kingfisher Airlines? How will it look?,"In the wake of the Kingfisher crisis, the real question is: will the King of Good Times be able to find a new set of willing lenders to bankroll his new ventures?",,2011-11-13 07:39:00+00:00,,"No surprise here. Kingfisher Airline’s stock fell about 20% this week, with headline-making bad news coming in every day. It is now almost a year since Kingfisher finalised a debt restructuring deal with lenders, in retrospect that deal was perhaps the last bit of good news for the airline. Now Vijay Mallya has asked the government for help in getting the lenders to bailout the airline’s debt. With Kingfisher in the doldrums, what happens to the rest of the UB Group? At least one analyst has argued that another group company, because of its relationship to Kingfisher, is effectively insolvent. Yet the beer and whisky businesses are still going strong. And the irrepressible Mallya, true to form has expanded into other high-profile businesses, everything from real estate to Formula One “The events over the past few years and months has been extremely disconcerting for the group,” says Nikhil Vora, managing director of IDFC Securities. “It is one of the few businesses where the company has sunk capital and borrowed a fair bit. Not only has brand Kingfisher taken a hit but it will also trouble the UB Group’s financiers.” And if banks do bailout Kingfisher, they may well require that Mallya pump money of his own into the business, money that could come from the rest of the UB Group. Crash and Burn A stream of bad news has emerged about Kingfisher this past week. The airline itself announced the cancellation of 31 flights on a daily basis till November 20. News emerged that the institutions which lease aircraft to Kingfisher plan to claw them back following doubts about the airlines ability to pay its dues. Oil companies now require the airline to pay them on a daily basis. Well over a hundred pilots have themselves quit the airline. But Kingfisher has been on shaky ground for much of the past year, if not in the past six years of its existence (the airline has had only one profitable quarter in the past six years). It missed a deadline to raise over Rs 1,000 crore from the international markets at the end of the last financial year. Its forecast of jet fuel prices in the debt recast plan was wildly optimistic. The market itself seemed to have few illusions about the debt restructuring. The stock has taken a virtually uninterrupted hammering since the last one year, falling steadily by over 73% (the Nifty index has declined by only about a fifth of that).",{},"['group', 'mallya', 'businesses', 'ub', 'debt', 'look', 'kingfisher', 'past', 'airline', 'airlines', 'minus', 'week']","Kingfisher Airline’s stock fell about 20% this week, with headline-making bad news coming in every day.

"Fashion leading category that helps e-commerce players grow, Marketing & Advertising News, ET BrandEquity",One in three orders for e-commerce player Snapdeal was from the 'fashion category' in 2015,,None,,"Image for representation only. Credit: Getty One in three orders for e-commerce player Snapdeal was from the fashion category in 2015. This includes goods like apparel, footwear and accessories. The company observed a 250 percent year-on-year growth in the category with users from Tier II cities vying for brands not available in their cities. Another e-commerce company Amazon Fashion also sees fashion as the fastest growing segment in India. ""The trend is not surprising. There is less penetration of brands in Tier II cities, which bring customers to us due to a wide assortment of brands,"" said Rahul Taneja VP, Category Management, Snapdeal. Taneja adds that fashion continues to be Snapdeals biggest category as frequency of purchase of apparel is higher than any other commodity. ""Fashion encourages customers to come back to us,"" he said. Talking about the surging fashion market in the e-commerce space, Mayank Shivam, Category Leader, Amazon Fashion, India feels that fashion today, is not only restricted to the large metros, but has also captured the imagination of consumers in remote cities and towns. ""E-commerce is able to bridge the gap and bring fashion closer to consumers in smaller markets. Online stores also give consumers the convenience of accessing a broad selection of brands and styles across all price-points, all at one place and at the click of a button,"" said Shivam. So to keep the fashion-conscious consumer happy in 2016, e-commerce players are incorporating better and innovative strategies. Snapdeal, for instance, has got into a strategic partnership with Shoppers Stop, wherein digital marketplace through a flagship Shoppers Stop store was launched. Customers ordering from Shoppers Stop store on Snapdeal can pick up the ordered products or get them delivered from the nearest Shoppers Stop store. Amazon wants to invest in the fashion ecosystem, where they will bring local crafts closer to customers in the coming year. Like last year, Amazon will be making investments in editorials, guide-books and videos on latest trend and fashion to establish Amazon Fashion as a fashion destination. In addition, the company aims to empower consumers through detailed product/brand information, customer reviews, expert opinions, styling trends forecast so they can make the right fashion choices. However, amidst all the competition, Digital wallet turned e-commerce firm Paytm has some different plans. For them, focus on unstructured category will rule the roost in 2016 as it did it 2015 along with brands. ""There are many private players and SMEs in the market and interestingly consumers are willing to experiment. This will remain our focus in the coming year,"" said Sudhanshu Gupta, Assistant Vice President Business, Paytm. Clearly, the success mantra for e-commerce players seems simple. Offer the widest range of products and entice them with the best discounts. After all, a customer wants the best in quality and bargain.",{},"['helps', 'category', 'grow', 'cities', 'brandequity', 'marketing', 'leading', 'amazon', 'fashion', 'players', 'consumers', 'shoppers', 'snapdeal', 'brands', 'stop', 'ecommerce', 'et']","Credit: GettyOne in three orders for e-commerce player Snapdeal was from the 'fashion category' in 2015.
