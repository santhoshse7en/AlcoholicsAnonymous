Mr. Karim has been on anti-hypertensive and oral hypoglycemic agents for 15 years and is known as a kind hearted and unassuming person by everyone who knows him. On physical examination Mr. Karim was alright with healthy vital signs. When asked how he was doing, Mr. Karim did not seem to be very well oriented with time, place or person. His speech was incoherent with frequent lapses in short time memory. When helped by his wife to answer questions, Mr. Karim became angry and reactive. In elderly patients like Mr. Karim, disorientation in time, place or person requires detailed history taking and evaluation. Two distinct patterns of disorientation are common; namely delirium and dementia. Both delirium and dementia are capable of causing aggressive behavior and thats why its important to have a fair idea of both. Dementia is characterized by profound memory loss which is usually short term and the patients are mostly elderly. Dementia is caused by organic diseases like Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and stroke. Delirium on the other hand is seen in both young and old patients. It may be described as acute mental confusion which may emerge due to a wide variety of reasons. Drug abuse and alcohol intoxication must be kept in mind while trying to manage a young patient who is delirious. If the patient is previously known to have chronic mental problems, aggressive or even violent behavior is always a possibility and medical staff must always be weary to tackle the situation with tact and efficiency. After all violent behavior is illegal outdoors just as much as it is illegal indoors. An approach to managing aggressive or violent behavior is outlined below: 1) It is good to assess the environment and to refrain from moving into the patients space until in a position of control. 2) All staff must react or communicate calmly and simply and take control of the patient gently. 3) All doctors, nurses and security staff should state their respective tasks firmly and simply. 4) Heroics can easily end up hurting the patient, family members or other staff and must therefore be absolutely avoided. 5) In case of a violent outburst an adequate number of staff to accompany the doctor. Six is ideal (one for immobilization of each limb, one for the head and one to assist with drugs) In most episodes of aggressive or violent behavior, it is good to remember that intra muscular drugs are practical. However, if verbal de-escalation has been achieved, oral and intra venous medications are excellent options as well. Oral drugs include diazepam and lorazepam. However such medications are contraindicated in patients with respiratory insufficiency. Under such circumstances, drugs like olanzapine or risperidone maybe given to the patient. Intravenous diazepam and midazolam are more potent then oral drugs if the patient can be convinced to cooperate with the hospital staff. If the patient cannot be controlled or show very few signs of cooling down at all, intramuscular (IM) drugs are a must. Drugs like midazolam, droperidol or olanzapine are best options. But none of these drugs are without potential side effects and thats why IM benztropine is a handy antidote at all times. In case of alcoholic delirium IM thiamine is most beneficial and can be given first hand with the other IM drugs. Treating a delirious, aggressive patient is a challenge indeed. Without proper training, teamwork and technical know how, one aggressive patient can end up hurting not only himself, but also his relatives and medical staff. Hospitals in our country are poorly equipped to deal with such sensitive patients and must therefore be more vigilant in helping them with tact, delicacy and firmness.
