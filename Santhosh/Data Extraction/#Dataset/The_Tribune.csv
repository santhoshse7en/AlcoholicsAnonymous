When she hits the bottle...,"Today, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.",Tribune News Service,2016-07-31T00:58:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"Linda ChhakchhuakToday, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.Among the key reasons for this exponential rise in alcohol consumption, particularly among urban upwardly-mobile women, is the misplaced notion that they are ‘cool’ and ‘liberated’ if they raise a glass. Whereas having the freedom to choose and breaking gender stereotypes are vital for women's agency, this need not necessarily extend to asserting the ‘right to consume alcohol’. Of course, predictably, liquor manufacturers have latched on to this popular perception of 'liberated womanhood' and they are not just launching but also aggressively marketing new variants of alcoholic drinks targeted specifically at women. Indeed, leading brands are not hesitant to concede that their markets have expanded, thanks largely to this growing trend.Unfortunately, the ‘good times’ only lead to not-so-good-times for many who start off as recreational drinkers but soon become habitual. As is the case with addicts around the world, according to Alcoholic Anonymous India (AA-I), women here, too, find it difficult to say, “I am an alcoholic”, words, they believe, are the first step towards dealing with this addiction. In the north-eastern states, while it's easy for women to buy a drink, it's difficult for them to find a de-addiction facility that caters to their needs. In fact, gender bias rears its ugly head even here, as families are ready to go all out to help a son but are only too eager to ignore, deny or hide a daughter's problem.Recently, in a first for the Northeast region, the AA-I set up the Shillong Women's Fellowship, a platform for women who want to give up their addiction. At the launch of this critical service, Father Joseph H. Pereira, founder of Kripa Foundation, which offers rehabilitation to those affected by chemical dependency and HIV/AIDS, emphasised that “alcoholism is a disease and not a sin to be condemned”. He observed, “There are so many people who are afflicted with this disease and many have succumbed to it. Yet, the shame and negative stereotype associated with this condition doesn't allow people to come forward and deal with their addiction.”For women battling chemical dependency, a term often used interchangeably with substance abuse, even admitting to addition is difficult, let alone confronting it. Sister Rose Paite, a member of the General Service Board (GSB) of the AA-I, who has worked on the issue of sobriety for women for the last 13-odd years, explained that the situation in the north-east states is dire because women, and the society at large, is in a state of denial.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Calling alcoholism a “hidden epidemic”, she fervently wished their efforts would soon question this dangerous status quo. Sister Paite is the convenor of the movement for helping Women in Recovery for Sobriety that hopes to encourage the creation of similar AA-I fellowships for women across the region.Both Father Pereira and Sister Paite strongly recommended the need for a “holistic method” like the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) method, which is based on a 12-step programme, as there was no “chemical solution for chemical dependency”. “The medical model has totally failed. There is nothing more powerful than the AA method,” they asserted, adding that if one has gained sobriety, they must not keep it to themselves but share the experience with others.As it is, the odds are stacked against women, be it socially or medically. Said Sister Paite, “Parents would like to spend much on sons, but when it comes to daughters, they say they do not have money.” Explaining the medical dimension, Dr Harsh Udawat, Chairman of the GSB of the AA-I, iterated that alcohol consumption was more risky for women than for men. “Alcoholism is a progressive disease and there is no real cure for it. As a doctor, I have seen innumerable cases and can definitely validate the fact that there is nothing really very good about alcohol. Naturally, it does come down to one's personal choice and there cannot be any denying that, but exercising caution is crucial when it comes to drinking. In any case, the death rate among alcohol dependent women is 50 per cent, which is 100 per cent higher than in men,” said the doctor, who is also a gastroenterologist in Jaipur, Rajasthan.Besides the experts, there were quite a few women from Mizoram and Delhi, who came forward to talk about their experiences and share their ideas on motivating those battling alcoholism to seek support. Stating that the programmes under AA “had come to their rescue”, they wanted many more to understand the value of the sisterhood they shared being part of an AA group. “As an alcoholic, I felt that I was on the verge of dying,” related one, while another spoke of how she had “decided to put my best foot forward to help others”. The woman, who led the group from Delhi, explained that there were 30 women associated with them, “all sober and recovering”, ready to talk about their experiences with their “sisters”. For women from Mizoram and Meghalaya present at the meeting, it was “cathartic” to come face-to-face with those who had benefited from the AA approach and hear them speak openly about addiction on a public platform.“Clearly, without sustained medical and psychological intervention to deal with their problem, women alcoholics are setting themselves for a downfall,” cautioned Sister Paite. This disturbing reality motivated her to initiate the Shillong Women's Fellowship so that it's easier for women to come forward and seek a helping hand. “I want the women from the Northeast to fearlessly work on their sobriety issues,” she urged. Under the Shillong Women's Fellowship, recovery meetings are slated to be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the Don Bosco Youth Centre in the city. While there is no fee for AA membership, an absolute must is the yearning to change.Women are natural fighters — they can speak up against discrimination, they can stand up to problems. If they are leading movements to bring about and enforce prohibition in several states, overcoming alcoholism cannot be insurmountable for them.  — WFS",{},"['alcohol', 'alcoholic', 'aai', 'hits', 'paite', 'cent', 'women', 'bottle', 'come', 'alcoholism', 'aa', 'sister']","Indeed, leading brands are not hesitant to concede that their markets have expanded, thanks largely to this growing trend.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/8/2000 0:00,,"HEALTH Alcoholism is a disease like cancer or diabetes Tribune News Service CHANDIGARH, Aug 7  The representative of the Disha group of Alcoholics Anonymous, who came with an invitation for their first anniversary meeting, which was held here yesterday, was quite specific. No photographs, no surnames. We just want to spread some awareness in the public about alcoholism. The common man has to know that alcoholism is a disease like cancer or diabetes or any other. And is very much curable . However, the disease is much misunderstood, thanks to the harsh judgements passed by society. Hence the stress on anonymity. Therefore Press is welcome at any A.A. open meetings or similar gathering of recovered alcoholics. The only restriction is a request not to disclose the name or take photographs of any A.A. member. Yesterdays meeting, in Indira Holiday Home was a revelation, at least for a non-alcoholic. First and foremost, it is important to understand that alcoholism is a disease. As Sidhu, once alcoholic and now sober army man, while speaking about his experiences said,"" The only difference is that, unlike any other disease, the entire family gets affected by it. Therefore the result is totally devastating."" Incidentally, this army man is also a former national sports champion. An alcoholic is like a tornado, who rolls through the lives of others. That is why, Al Anon, the fellowship of the families of alcoholics is equally important. As it is through sharing of personal experiences, members gain insight into dealing with their own situation. Nimmi, a member of the Al Anon revealed,"" I learnt after attending Al Anon meetings that I am not responsible for my husband being an alcoholic. All this while, I was crucifying myself that my husband was drinking because I was not beautiful or may be good enough for him. This immature attitude resulted in my social and family life. It was after I joined the Al Anon that my focus shifted on myself."" This is what the Al Anon group does, through sharing a common bond and a realisation that their lives have been affected by another persons drinking, the families of the alcoholics learn to share experience, hope and strength. Mahi, a daughter of an alcoholic, too learned through the programme to stop comparing her father with those of her friends. "" I stopped hating my father for one. I was asked, by someone in the programme, that if your father was suffering from cancer would you still treat him badly? This changed the entire perspective. Through sharing, I learnt that my father was a sick man and I have to stop punishing him."" All this while, when the families are gaining confidence through self help, the alcoholic following some simple steps is on his way to recovery and sobriety. In his endeavour, his fellow alcoholics help him and so do some professionals. Dr A.K. Malhotra, Head of the De-addiction Center, PGI, while presenting the clinical aspect of the disease said that a sober cannot understand the problems of an alcoholic. "" Medical treatment amounts to only 10 per cent in the road to the recovery. Here lies the importance of the A.A. fellowship. The alcoholic learns to speak out and also evaluate what he has said. After all they and only they know what the illness feels like."" Actually the pledge of an alcoholic sums it all up :"" I am responsible, when anyone, anywhere reaches out for help. I want the hand of A.A. always to be there. And for that, I am responsible.""",{},"['alcoholic', 'tribune', 'father', 'sharing', 'india', 'al', 'man', 'disease', 'alcoholism', 'chandigarh', 'alcoholics', 'anon', 'aa']","The common man has to know that alcoholism is a disease like cancer or diabetes or any other.

"Kicking the bottle, one day at a time",The picturesque resort along the gushing waters of the Beas at Manali provided the perfect backfor a cocktail party.,Pradeep Sharma,2015-06-21T01:57:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"The picturesque resort along the gushing waters of the Beas at Manali provided the perfect backdrop for a cocktail party. However, over 200 cheerful former alcoholics, a majority of them anytime drinkers, along with their families preferred to say “cheers” over a glass of juice or a cup of coffee. The occasion was the 12th Convention of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), that was organised recently.The motley crowd of recovering alcoholics comprised businessmen, private sector executives, government servants and women professionals. Their transformation had not been sudden. It was the result of a programme of recovery of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a worldwide fellowship of recovering alcoholics which boasts of a membership of over 30 lakh with over 30,000 sober alcoholics in India alone.Kicking off one session after another with the prayer “God grant us serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can and wisdom to know the difference”, various speakers narrated heart-rending stories and how they escaped from the deadly dragnet of alcoholism “one day at a time” through AA’s 12-step recovery programme.“I have turned to fertiliser from garbage,” a participant, sober for nearly 20 years, summed up the transformation. Through AA, he came to realise that he was not a bad person but a sick person suffering from an incurable progressive disease called alcoholism. However, the disease can be arrested “one day at a time” by attending meetings where the AA members share experiences, strength and hope. The anonymity of the problem drinker is strictly maintained.What is Alcoholics Anonymous?Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other so that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.

AA’s helpline (094170-37358) or website  www.aa.org can help you] FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNT‘I was drinking all day long, wishing death would come in one blow’Alcohol does not discriminate between sexes. Women are as much affected as men though women alcoholics face a far graver social stigma. Never once since my late teens did I think I would be able to remain sober for over a month. And, here I am, sober for a few years now. I am a miracle.Alcohol was once the solution for all my problems. It solved my insecurities, loneliness, anger, sense of not being good enough, being the odd one out everywhere… a few drinks would make all these and so many other thoughts and feelings just disappear. I drank alone and I drank like no one else I knew. Slowly, long before I knew it, alcohol ceased to be my friend and my solution. I was drinking throughout the day and wishing death would come in one blow and end the suffering that life had become. It took me a decade to admit that maybe drinking and my life, being the hell it was, were interlinked!I couldn’t ask anyone for help. That’s for the weak, I felt. I still don’t remember how I got to hear of AA. God alone knows how, one morning at around 3 am, I got online and noted down a helpline number of AA, got drunk and went to sleep. By now, I had no regular job, stayed with my parents and was unable to even make a sandwich for myself or my son, who was six years old then. I could not taste food, coordinate colours and my movements were awkward. With no choice at all, I declared to myself that I would go and check the drunkards who went to a meeting with a name like AA.By evening, I was on my knees begging my father to go into the rooms to see whether it was good enough for me. You see, I was dying slowly physically. Mentally and emotionally, I was already dead, but with every bit I had in me, I wanted to know whether the meeting of AA members was up to the mark! I was a woman. I was scared. But unbeknown to me, I had been blessed by the gift of desperation. My father scouted the room for me and came back with the Big Book (basic text of AA). The next day, I went to my first meeting and have never looked back. Being a woman doesn’t stop me from heading to the meeting anywhere now. The members of AA accept me and care for me like my family.I do not want to ever live that hell I lived in. Going to the meetings, getting a sponsor (to do the AA programme) and learning to practice the AA principles in my day-to-day life is responsible for every good thing in my life today. Once I stopped drinking, I had my broken life to deal with and nothing to hide behind. I had to find another way to live. That new design of living came to me via my sponsor through the Big Book. I do not want to remember my last drink but I do remember that unbearable pain. I don’t have that today. I don’t wake up and have that big black hole in my soul anymore. Now, I lead a good, full life. Alcoholism brought me to my knees because it led me to the gates of hell and yet I couldn’t stop drinking. Today I can. I have some tools, steps and some friends who actually like me. This programme gives me the opportunity to be the woman that God wants me to be.(The writer, whose identity remains anonymous going by AA’s policy, has been sober for a few years now)",{},"['alcohol', 'drinking', 'stop', 'kicking', 'help', 'life', 'day', 'bottle', 'getting', 'sober', 'alcoholics', 'aa']","However, the disease can be arrested “one day at a time” by attending meetings where the AA members share experiences, strength and hope.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/11/2001 0:00,,"CHANDIGARH CALLING F OR the first time in past couple of years the Shramdaan  voluntary effort to manually de-silt the Sukhna lake in Chandigarh  received a good response from city residents as well as officials of the Chandigarh Administration. Senior officials of the administration made it a point to go to the lake each morning. Students of schools and colleges also did exemplary work at Sukhna Lake in desilting. These included Govt Sr Sec School, Sector 21; Industrial Training Institute, Sector 28; Sri Guru Gobind Singh College, Sector 26; Director, NSS, Chd; Panjab University; DAV Model School, Sector 15; Govt Sr Sec School, Sector 18; Dev Samaj School, Sector 21; Govt High School, Sector 7; and Govt College of Education, Sector 20, Chandigarh. Departments and organisations also stepped up their efforts to save Sukhna  one of the famous tourist spots and favourite destination of the morning walkers. Among the major participants were the engineering department, UT power generation giant Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), Army Engineers, the Haryana drainage department and the Punjab drainage department. Last week the administration honoured 43 city residents who regularly come to participate in the shramdaan. The local MP, Mr Pawan Kumar Bansal, had sent in six tippers ( earth excavating machines) costing about Rs 45 lakh from his MP Local Area Development Fund to be used for Municipal Corporation work as well as in shramdaan at lake. The administration roped in sponsors like CITCO, MILKFED, Haryana Dairy Development, ICICI Bank, Quark, Talwar Dairy, Hotel & Restaurant Association of Chandigarh and Shiv Bhandar Sector 26. Defiling of Sukhna The serene Sukhna lake, hitherto a haven for joggers, health freaks, casual visitors and, of course, the weary Chandigarhians, who flock to seek momentary reprieve from the blazing winds and the stressful city life, is fast shaping up into a place of pandemonium and trash-dumping ground. People can be seen sauntering around along with their pets. The presence of these canines keep the passersby on their toes to meet an eventuality. The over-enthusiastic joggers do not use the track earmarked for them. They can be seen jog-trotting and jostling away with a jumbled crowd of visitors, especially during their evening promenade. Some even do aerobic exercises on the lake lawns. Picnickers, too, contribute their mite in defiling these well-manicured lawns by littering away bread and biscuit wrappings and other refuse. The gutka and paan-chewing clan makes it all the more ugly and unsightly. Cigarette butts and half-burnt beeries can be seen scattered around despite the provision of refuse-bins. The undaunted few cross all parameters of sanity by surreptitiously slipping into the bushes, adjacent to the jogging track, and easing themselves. The children entertainment corner, confectionery and refreshment joints, more often than not, remain crowded due to their close proximity. The light music played to enthral music-lovers becomes a misnomer as the melodious tunes die down in the deafening din of the milling crowd storming these hotspots. Is the Chandigarh Administration listening? Pressing problem Chandigarhs straight talking Administrator, Lieut Gen J.F. R. Jacob (Retd), known not to mince words, has done it again. He has asked officials to re-deploy surplus staff of the Government Printing Press in other departments of the Chandigarh where a staff shortage exists. In Chandigarh, despite its small size, several cadres of employees working in various departments exist. But due to some short-sightedness of the bureaucracy about three decades ago none of the employees is inter -transferable. This in a way breeds contempt for the rules as the employees know that they will never be shifted out. Merging of all cadres and forming a uniform cadre has been on the cards for long. In case of the government press it is brimming with additional staff and once modernisation is carried out more and more employees will be surplus. Sample this the binding section of the press has 158 government employees. With the Government of India not sanctioning any new posts the idea seems right to re-deploy employees in other places. However, employees true to their sarkari upbringing reacted sharply. Their union issued a statement that efforts should be made to bring work to the press. The employees probably need to be told that more work will require better quality of machines and these machines need an even smaller workforce to run. And all this ruckus is being raised even as the administration has said that employees status as government servants will be protected. A discrimination Why does the Chandigarh Housing Board make distinction between the general power of attorney (GPA) holders of the flat allotted under the discretionary quota and under the general quota for the purpose of getting the flat transferred in the name of the GPA holders, asks a Chandigarhian. Earlier the Housing Board used its discreet at the time of allotment of a flat under the quota and now it discriminates by imposing such undesirable restriction, and on both the account, the sufferer is the common man. So over to the Chandigarh Administrator, Lt. Gen (Retd) J.F.R. Jacob for saving the commoner from a feeling of his being beaten twice. Such condition of barring the GPA holder of flat allotted under the discretionary quota should be removed immediately. Drawing the line The Chandigarh traffic police has started a special drive to check motorists who are in habit of jumping the red light. For the purpose, special naakas are being set up near the various traffic light points. Help of plain cloth police personnel is also taken to apprehend the jumpers. However, polices own house is not in order. The mandatory stop line and zebra crossing is missing at several traffic light points in the city. There is no such line or crossing at the busy Transport Chowk light points. The pedestrian crossing signboard is lying on the ground (see photo on top of the page by Manoj Mahajan). There are several other light points where the stopline and zebra crossing are missing, including the one near the Panjab University gate. Interestingly, on the newly erected light points, the authorities concerned forgot to mark the line and crossing  traffic light point on the dividing road of Sectors 24 is an example. Urban biodiversity The Environment Society of India (ESI) is launching a campaign to plant the saplings of mangoes (Mangifera indica) in about 450 mango groves in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali. The sites on which these towns were built were dotted with mango trees. Although the trees preservation order, 1952, issued by the Capital project authority, Chandigarh, has saved many mango groves in Chandigarh, yet several mango trees have collapsed due to old age and storms. For example, the number of mango trees in the city birds sanctuary in 1989 was 20, now the number has gone down to eight only. Besides, the ESI has urged the Chandigarh administration, HUDA and PUDA to reduce the use of pesticides and chemicals. The sparrows die when they take the dead flies killed by insecticide bait. Similarly chemical fogging operations have an adverse effect on useful insects like bees, glowworms, butterflies etc. In old cities the people used to put up earthen jars on the house tops and spread grain and water for the birds. The ESI will launch educational campaign asking the citizens to place birdbaths and feed the birds. These actions will promote biodiversity. Punjabi pride It was a moment of pride for the Punjabi theatre buffs when the Punjabi musical play Shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh was successfully staged at one of Indias best auditoriums  The Abhinav Theatre, Jammu. The play was staged to mark the conclusion of inter-state Prithviraj Kapoor Theatre Festival on the 29th death anniversary of the doyen of Hindi cinema. The play was so well rated that its two performances were staged under the festival organised by National Theatre Arts Society  one at Jammu and another at Pathankot. The cynosure of all eyes during the festival was the director couple Pran and Sunita Sabbharwal, who were even honoured by Mr Harbans Singh, Minister for Youth Services and Sports, Jammu and Kashmir. The script of the play was written by Sunita herself and the cast included a number of local actors also. The shows were sponsored by North Zone Cultural Centre, Patiala. This was perhaps the first time a Punjabi play was getting such a tremendous response in another state. This is just a step towards strengthening Punjabi theatre. No speed limit boards Although the Administrations engineering wing has done a lot of good to the residents of Sectors 33, 34, 44 and 45 by repairing the dividing roads, it needs to be reminded that the speed limit signboards are yet to be put back. About two months back when work on these roads started, these signboards had been removed to facilitate the repairs. But these have not been restored. The result is lack of awareness about the speed to be maintained in these areas. Residents also take it easy by driving as fast as they want to and nothing much can be done about this problem. The reason being the excuse that there is no indication about the limit to be maintained. The indications should be made available at the earliest lest lives of people should be endangered. Labour of love It was a brave and wise act on the part of Colonel Hoshiar Singh Yadav (retd), a resident of Category I in Modern Housing Complex, Manimajra, who initiated the effort of having a long barricade in the lane of garages located at the back of the multi-storeyed flats built eight years back. All these years, the residents of the Duplex (Independent) houses which came into being much after the Multistoreyed flats, had always preferred to cross these garages lane in order to reach the main shopping complex. This had resulted in fast moving vehicles both four and two wheeler endangering the children and adults, specially during late evening hours since there was no lighting in these garages. Col Yadav helped by other residents of the block then put up a proposal to the Chandigarh Housing Board for their help. But the latter told them to get the barricades built at their own cost since the lane was a private property of the occupants and the CHB cannot made it a public passage. The barricades built with iron pipes have now benefited directly the residents of eight blocks of category I, each having 24 flats, thus a total of 192 flats. All this was done by Col Yadav and other residents of this block at their own expenses. But surprisingly they are yet to get any financial support from other block residents who benefited by this societal cause. Distress call Two weeks back, we wrote about 30-year-old Tulsi Devi who required a double valve transplant and was in dire need of money. We received a spontaneously tremendous response from readers and there were letters from far off places offering help. The story of Jamuna Devi, who belongs to Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh, is somewhat similar. She suffers from a serious heart ailment. Her husband, Vinod Kumar, is out of job and the couple has two children. In short, the story is heart rending. As per the estimate given by the Cardiology Department, PGI, Jamuna Devi urgently requirs Rs 1,75,000 to undergo an ASD device closure.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,7/29/2001 0:00,,"Alcoholic Anonymous  kindles hope for alcoholics Shivani Bhakoo Ludhiana, July 28 Not many may know it, but there is a forum that provides men and women a platform where they share their experiences, strengths and hopes to overcome alcoholism. Hundreds of men and women who could hardly walk two straight steps due to excessive drinking have not only given up their drinking habits but are leading a normal life  all thanks to Alcoholic Anonymous, a voluntary rehabilitation programme which is encouraging several alcoholics to regain full control of their lives. Alcoholic Anonymous, a non- profit voluntary organisation, has already spread its wings all over the world with an encouraging response. The organisation with its origin in the USA was brought to India in the late fifties. There are estimated to be about 350 voluntary groups in India in which over 6,500 workers encourage people to stop drinking. These groups do not belong to any sect, denomination, political, parties organisations or institutions. Nor do they engage in any controversy. The prime objective of its members is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety. Gurdeep Singh, who was an alcoholic a few years back, is today away from the first fatal drink. Gurdeep was born to his parents after 14 years of their marriage. I was a pampered child. During these 14 years, my parents visited various temples, mosques and tied threads. I was put in the best school of the city, my father expired when I was in the ninth standard, he said. During his university days, Gurdeep never went to any shop or bar to have a drink. His life was changed when he went to Mumbai for his job training. According to Gurdeep, real life began in Mumbai. No relatives, no well-wishers. He could do whatever he wanted. He became very popular amongst friends. Time passed with lots of hard work and drinking and dancing. His alcoholic intake progressed and capacity increased tremendously. Slowly and slowly, my breakfast, lunch and dinner turned out to be neat pegs. I felt myself on the top of the world, he said. His life took a drastic turn. Gurdeep met with a number of accidents. While once he was drunk, he promised somebody to get married. He married the girl and promised not to touch alcohol again. He started losing his jobs one after the other. There were regular fights with wife and in-laws. Now, when he was in a tight grip of alcohol, even if he wanted to stop drinking, he could not. By this time, all the property, jobs, respect, health and self-respect was on the road. I met one of my friends who suggested me to go to Alcoholic Anonymous which has changed my entire life. For me, not drinking for over 11 years is like a world record. I can eat, I love to sleep and I am contented and happy, said Gurdeep Singh. The therapeutic value of one alcoholic helping another is unparalleled here, said Ranjit (not his real name). On the eve of his commission into the Defence Force, he was kicked out of the academy because he bashed up his senior after a bout of drinking. Virtually on the roads after being disowned by his relatives, he became more chronic alcoholic till he found help from Alcoholic Anonymous. Its been three years now. Ranjit has not touched the bottle. Sunil, under peer pressure of alcohol, left his wife, sold household goods, and committed a dacoity once to get a bottle of alcohol. He said, on one lucky day, I came across some friends who had got over this problem. I also went into the programme, and I would complete three years of sobriety in January 2002. According to the preamble of this organisation, the only requirement for the membership of the Alcoholic Anonymous is a desire to stop drinking. It has several centers that include Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Nangal, Sundernagar and Shimla. In Ludhiana twice a week these people meet in the compound of Sacred Heart Convent School, Jamalpur.",{},"['alcohol', 'alcoholic', 'tribune', 'drinking', 'stop', 'life', 'india', 'gurdeep', 'world', 'anonymous', 'voluntary', 'chandigarh', 'went']","Alcoholic Anonymous, a non- profit voluntary organisation, has already spread its wings all over the world with an encouraging response.

Better late than never. Alcoholism is a progressive disease of the mind, an allergy of the body, and a spiritual malady. The first step in overcoming an alcohol addiction is admitting being powerless and that life has become unmanageable. I am a recovered alcoholic. My date of sobriety, as it is called in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), is the last time I took a drink — November 24, 2013. I distinctly remember the time and place where I was, when I consciously put the glass down saying enough is enough. My body simply could not take the two or three double Patiala pegs of Double Black Johnnie Walker on the rocks every night. I am sure that if I had not stopped, like many others we hear or know, I would have been dead by now. A big part of alcoholism, which we often lose sight of, is the people in your life, who aid and abet — the enablers. It could be a coterie of so-called well-wishers, the freely flowing booze at political fundraisers, weddings, bootleg brands behind closed doors, one-for-the-road Army brats. It could also be family members who turn a blind eye and never acknowledge a drinking problem, or show tough love so the alcoholic gets help. Mann, in a brave act, had showed up with his mother and announced that he was giving up. But for many alcoholics, the cause of drinking is deep-rooted in family and early childhood trauma, lack of an emotional connection with parents or siblings, or family pressures that justify an escape to solitude and drinking. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });However, faith in the Almighty; seeking professional help, such as a mental health professional; staying away from booze-filled occasions; clearing out the liquor cabinet… is more tough than half-admitting at a political rally that you are promising to quit, even though you claim you do not have a drinking problem. In India, you have to be half-apologetic and give many explanations to near and dear ones why you stopped drinking or how bad the drinking problem had gotten!

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,2/8/2010 0:00,,"Open House Response Admn-MC work areas need streamlining It is on record, rather a historical fact, that a majority party alliance, in the city, had allowed election of a Mayor from the opposition due to inside party bickering. Recent media reports spoke about a free for all in the house of MCC. The name of Mayor is missing from big administrative functions and senior administrative functionaries are often missing at MC functions. There has always existed a huge gap of differences between the offices of the Mayor and the Municipal Commissioner. The status of the Mayor has been downgraded considerably. The Mayor has, once, not been allowed by the administrator to proceed abroad to attend an international meeting of Mayors, against an official invitation. To rub salt on the injuries of the Mayor, a bureaucrat was detailed in his place. There are endless examples to prove the point. The quoted precedents present a wrong picture of the municipal autonomy. Till the time the counsellors of different political parties got together, neither can they deliver the expected work to the residents nor can they maintain and retain the dignity of the institution of the Mayor. Rather they will remain pushed to the wall by bureaucracy. Sewa Singh, K-77, Sarita Vihar, New Delhi Power contradictions affect work The office of the Municipal Corporation is nothing more than a shuttle between the offices of the Mayor, Municipal Commissioner and the Chandigarh Administration. The residents of Chandigarh are not even clear about the exact provider of several amenities- whether it was the administration or the Municipal Corporation. Sanjeev Singh Bariana has rightly pointed out in his Open House debate that in the absence of a clear cut demarcation of the functions of the Municipal Corporation and Chandigarh Administration for making available the civic amenities, medical facilities and rehabilitation of slums, the working of the Corporation is affected. There are contradictions in results due to separate interference by the administration and the corporation. Instead of boasting a few sectors as dustbin free, we need a unified action plan for a dust bin free entire city. In a single instance, no work on multi-level parking has been done on ground and the files are shuttled between different wings of the administration and the corporation. Parking is one among biggest problems of coming times Ravi Mallick, Chartered Accountant, Chandigarh Increase Mayors term The Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh has done well for having transformed itself from a cash deficient organisation to a one with surplus revenue. To a common citizen, it does not really matter who calls the shots as long as all the services are being provided efficiently. Only a clear line of demarcation needs to be made, in the respective roles, to prevent overlapping between functioning of MC and the administration. Undoubtedly, the biggest issues facing the future of the city are increasing traffic, the rising levels of pollution, the lack of adequate parking areas, the menace of stray dogs, violation of the building byelaws and the nuisance of liquor shops in residential sectors. It is high time that both the authorities sat on a common table and worked out a specific plan of action for future by clearly demarcating individual areas of work. The Mayors term should be definitely increased to a minimum of two years giving them enough time to produce positive results. Mayors of cities like Mumbai and Kolkata can serve a five year term. Navita Singh MC White Paper needed In reference to the Admn doesnt let MC grow by Sanjeev Singh Bariana, I am of the opinion that there was absolutely no need of corporation in Chandigarh since the city remained a disputed territory till date between Punjab and Haryana. It was set up basically in the name of democracy by the political parties to carry out the affairs by the elected representatives instead of the bureaucracy. Municipal functions including sanitation, roads, parks, green belts etc still remain in shambles, except for the bigwigs in the UT. Consequently, the southern sectors, villages, colonies and the slums remained the worst sufferers. Instead of getting municipal services, the citizens are facing number of taxes such as paid parking; property tax etc imposed by the corporation and more are in the pipeline. Red tape and lack of infrastructure come in the way of overall development in the city. The problem in the relationship between the political executive and the bureaucracy may be because of lack of confidence/trust. The political set up, in the city, in the absence of a Vidhan Sabha, feels that bureaucrats are the stumbling block in the way of executing various schemes initiated by them. On the other hand, the bureaucrats consider themselves as an important instrument of governance. This may be the genesis of the mistrust. There is a need for administrative and political accountability, separately. A White Paper needs to be issued as a large numbers of people do not know the exact functioning of the Corporation. Various services are divided between MC and the departments without any rationale. It would be prudent if all the developmental activities, budget, grants, expenditure on different works executed by the corporation, foreign as well as domestic tours of the councillors/officers and the expenditure incurred, besides details of income are incorporated in the white paper. S.K. Khosla, Sector 40C, Chandigarh Use surplus MC revenue Sanjeev Singh Bariana, in his article, has very perceptively analysed the malaise that afflicts the City Beautiful, and offered helpful suggestions to cure it. I suggest a holistic approach to the problem. There are three primary functions, namely, management, maintenance and planning and development, with architecture as a major component. The Chandigarh Administration should essentially manage the city in terms of law and order, traffic control, financing, and socio-cultural infrastructure such as education, health, sports, museums, libraries, etc. The Municipal Corporation should primarily look after the supply and maintenance of civic services like electricity, water, sewage disposal, recycling, water harvesting, rainwater handling, telecommunications, parks, arboriculture, environment, roads and parking. New projects and additions/alterations in the existing buildings vis-à-vis the city as a whole should be assigned to an autonomous body. The Government of India should establish it by an Act of Parliament, with a professional at the helm of affairs who has a vision with a working knowledge of the various disciplines. The existing department of urban planning and the engineering organisation should work under the new Authority. Mixing of the function of planning with impregnable executive powers has played havoc with Le Corbusiers priceless legacy. We wishfully want our city to be declared as a World Heritage. Acquisition of the land, which falls under the Union Territory of Chandigarh, may be done in order to develop a long-term master plan with inputs from the uprooted population. The master plan should be reviewed every five years to assess what went wrong and what could be done to prevent its recurrence in future, besides adding new features/facilities in the light of socio-economic and technological changes. The people displaced by the acquisition of land for future development should be given land on a concession in the new plan, apart from the compensation at current market rates for their land acquired by the Administration. The surplus revenue of the MC should not be sent to the Central Pool. It should be spent on improving the urban landscape by providing better facilities and the introduction of large-scale civic art like murals, sculpture gardens, adventure parks for children and green retreats for senior citizens and nature-lovers. Schoolchildren should be involved in the citys landscaping so that they get practical education on conservation of environment. Dr SS Bhatti, Former principal, Chandigarh College of Architecture Dual control must end Sanjeev Singh Bariana in his article on Admn doesnt let MC grow in the Open House has very rightly pointed out that dual control in certain areas of administration must end. Residents suffer on account of unclear areas of action for the different wings. With particular reference to the Southern Sectors, I will to say that roads are in a bad shape. Slum dwellers have occupied portions of land and garbage lies scattered, at places. Street lights are never functioning, at places. Scenes of defecation can be witnessed in the open. The area has an invisible green belt. There are abysmally poor markets, banks, chemists and even ATMs. As a common citizen I will like to know as to who will take care of our basic amenities- Administration or MC? Despite showing a cash-reserve of Rs 500 crores, why MC continues to remain blind to our necessities? Subhadra Kumari, Sector 50-D, Chandigarh South calls for attention The debate initiated by the Chandigarh Tribune should be a ringing bell to awaken the authorities, administration and the Municipal Corporation, to wake up and sort out the anomalies in delivering best results for the tax paying residents of the city. Due to bundle of contradictions, unwarranted differences and locking of horns over trivial matters, development work has suffered, particularly in the Southern sectors. The North-South divide has become a harsh reality. The revenue surplus MC has failed to deliver results for the residents with regard to certain minimum facilities. More than half of the Southern sectors are without green belts and street lights seem to be never functioning. In a small instance, the roads of Sectors 50 and 51 house possibly the worst roads, street corners are occupied by slum dwellers and are flooded with pictures of open defecation. The councillors need to stop passing the buck to the opposition quarters and stand united to lend more power to the house functioning.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/10/2006 0:00,,"Darkness to light As 200 members of Alcoholics Anonymous, who once couldnt be trusted to bring home the pay packets, are gearing up to hold a three-day convention at Patni Top from June 15, Saurabh Malik talks to their families in Chandigarh to find out how they have cured themselves of their spouses and parents alcoholic illness Rising from the grave of a dead family life, 15-year-old Dhruv (name changed to protect identity) is living again, lightheartedly. Until a few years ago, the burden of breathing was suffocating him. Looking for steady existence amidst the rubble of shattered whisky bottles and smashed family life, he would often struggle hard to stop the tears from flowing, along with alcohol  the invigorating elixir that was killing his father slowly and ruthlessly. ""My spirits would take a deep plunge every time dad raised a toast,"" he says in a surprisingly steady voice that comes from looking at things from a distance. ""Those were the days when I considered my dad a culprit. He would hit the bottle on one pretext or the other. And I, on my part, would strike back with a punch of callous words and obstinate behaviour."" Drowned childhood All this was eight years ago. Dhruv still recalls the time when he would argue with his father for hours and make him swear against drinking during the precious few hours he was sober. ""But then he would forget all about it and come back home after drowning all the pledges in liquor,"" he says. ""As he would scream and shout before fighting with my mother, I would sit huddled in a corner feeling cheated and betrayed"". How could his father swear upon him and forget all about it in a few gulps? The question would torture him for hours together and leave him embittered. After all, it is not easy for an eight-year old to reconcile with the fact that his father is lying to him especially when uncorrupted by the ways of the world he thinks truth to be the ultimate reality. In any case sulking did not help. To worsen things, his practising advocate father started losing clients. ""They would come to his office and leave without a word after finding him busy with the bottle instead of briefs,"" says Dhruv. ""It goes without saying that the distance between the two ends began to increase incessantly."" Helping hand It was then his mother came to know about Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon family group and Alateen  organisations cooperating with each other for the welfare of the alcoholics and their families, including the children. Soon Dhruv decided to join Alateen and found himself sitting amidst strangers with familiar tales during the meetings. ""Initially, I found it impossible to open up. After all, even a kid is taught not to wash his dirty linen in public and use social organisations as clotheslines to hang the yarns. But then I started to loosen up. And realise I was not the only victim of alcoholism. There were so many like me trying hard to live again. And there were others who had overcome the problem and were helping strangers to lead a quality life."" In the meetings, Dhruv realised that his father is not a criminal, but a patient. A sick man in need of love and understanding! He also realised that the disease of excessive drinking, like diabetes, can only be controlled and not cured. And with the realization came the feeling of sympathetic love and compassion. ""For the first time in so many years I was purged of the hatred I had for my father. I realised that I had to focus on myself and my immediate surroundings. I just could not stand behind my dad with a stick in my angry hands, watching life slip by. If dad wanted to go in for a cure, the feeling had to come from within him. There was hardly anything I could do about it"". As he talks you realise alcohol, that has destroyed his father and family, has also made a man out of this teenager. The fizz of childhood may be missing in his life, but its still stable and rock steady. The fact that he scored 89 per cent in the Class X CBSE examinations is nothing but a testimony to this effect. ""My only regret is that dad kept on raising a toast but did not join me in the celebrations`85. But I am sure he will be there by my side when I achieve the next milestone`85,"" he says. As the meeting comes to an end, you realise that Dhruv has started to live again. Living life Right, along with Dhruv, Sneha and Poonam (names changed) are also living, but for others. Sneha only recently lost her spouse to alcohol. But Poonams husband has stopped hitting the bottle with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous. In any case, both are still the members of the Al-Anon family group. Today they tell the families of so many alcoholics not to contribute to the problem by taking over all the responsibilities. In fact, they ask the members to concentrate on themselves so that they can improve their lives. ""The families must realise that by taking care of themselves and their immediate surroundings, they are not acting selfish,"" asserts Sneha. Sounds sensible! All for one Just in case you know little about the Al-Anon family group, here is something about the organisation: The group is fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics sharing experience, strength and hope for solving their common problems. The group believes that alcoholism is a family illness. It has just one purpose: to help the families of the alcoholics. Alateen is a part of the Al-Anon fellowship designed for younger friends and relatives of alcoholics.",{},"['tribune', 'dad', 'life', 'father', 'india', 'group', 'realise', 'alanon', 'family', 'dhruv', 'chandigarh', 'alcoholics', 'families']","""But then he would forget all about it and come back home after drowning all the pledges in liquor,"" he says.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,9/2/2005 0:00,,"Chote se dil ki badi si asha Deepkamal Kaur and Minna Zutshi Tribune News Service S wanky cars, a plush house and money to buy all that catches fancy. And a brush with fame while notching up a few points on celebrity quotient. It may not be a socially-desirable list of must-haves, but it does ring a familiar bell. Suddenly, it has become right and even fashionable to dream of a lifestyle that hitherto was the prerogative of the select few who had well-heeled parents. The ""generation-now"" (instant gratification and living in present are the distinguishing characteristics of this generation), has delightfully ripped apart all older taboos. It is ready to give a hurried burial to all self-conscious stirrings about good people dont aspire for riches and pricey branded wears. And the ""gen-now"" does not mind revising its ""wealthy is wise and branded is bright"" stance if it disturbs the peace of mind! ""Work hard, strive hard and enjoy to the hilt the fruits of your labour. And create your own oasis of happiness. Why be apologetic about being rich and famous?"" says Sugandha Mishra, who has made a name for herself in music vocal. ""You can manifest your dreams and aspirations. For me, music is a journey and not the destination,"" she adds. A lifestyle that offers ""good things of life"" and a good measure of financial comfort does not strike a discordant note with this young singer, who has a penchant for designer wear and costume jewellery. Having ambitions and markedly ambitious ambitions is no longer frowned upon. ""The more, the better"" is the pulse of the day. ""Theres so much to do. And a long way to go. I have to take my business to its zenith. This is just the beginning for me. I have been planning weddings, receptions and birthday parties for the citys crème de la crème , but I have to expand my business, introduce newer concepts for theme parties and add variety to decoration styles,"" gushes Ritu Sidhu, proprietor of Party Bells, an event management company. ""Its not just NRIs who are fond of lavish parties and grand marriage receptions, even city folks like to have functions in a big way. Big is better!"" For Navraj Hans, the son of singer Hans Raj Hans, fame is something he has been a privy to since his childhood. He has seen his father feted and felicitated a number of times. ""I want to be popular like my father,"" he says, as a matter of fact. ""I have had the best that I could expect as a child  all sorts of luxuries, costliest musical instruments, foreign education and overseas trips, all thanks to my dad. I, too, want to win the hearts of audiences not only in Punjab, but also outside India. I have been practising hard for four to five hours a day,"" Navraj explains. Its not that ""generation-now"" wants things (read success) on a platter. They dont mind sweating it out. But its not a sweat-gone-awry  everything has to be planned meticulously and diligently. ""I will launch myself through an album at some appropriate time, may be after a year or two,"" says Navraj, adding, ""Cultural festivals have certainly boosted my confidence. I have come to know about my competitors and my own strong points."" Goal-orientation is the keyword for many like Kanwalpreet, a gold medalist in the recently-held Afro-Asian Games, and international hockey player. He aspires to take part in the forthcoming Olympics. He practises rigorously under his coach, Mr Mohan Singh. ""I get up early and reach Guru Gobind Singh Stadium by 6 am. Then I have two hours of focused practice. After my day, I am back again in the stadium for practice,"" he says. Interestingly, in some cases fame takes on a different shade. It has altruistic add-ons to it. Twentyfive-year-old Simran Kalias heart beats for the downtrodden. She says she has dedicated her life to Free Co-Educational Mission School, near Burlton Park, where she teaches school dropouts and underprivileged children who cannot afford to study at private schools. ""I made this humble beginning with my mother some seven years back, but now the parents are themselves sending their children to us. This work gives me peace of mind, which I guess, is the best reward,"" she remarks. An exotic touch gives even more life to dreams, as Jyotsna Malhotra, who runs a dance academy along with her brother, tells us. She plans to go to the US to pursue a diploma course in journalism, though she says that eventually she would return to her own country. ""I have taken TOEFEL examination and am just waiting for the result. Most of my paternal and maternal relatives stay in the United States.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,5/10/2001 0:00,,"Nitish announces education project K. G. Dutt Narwana (Jind), May 9 The Union Agriculture Minister, Mr Nitish Kumar, today announced the establishment of a cooperative education project in Haryana on the request of the Chief Minister, Mr Om Prakash Chautala. He said the decision of the Government of India to name the National Agriculture Science Centre after Devi Lal, former Deputy Prime Minister, was taken keeping in view his contribution to the field of agriculture. Mr Nitish Kumar was addressing a large public gathering on the occasion of the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Institute of Cooperative Management at Narwana today. Hailing the role of Devi Lal in the uplift of farmers and development of the agriculture sector, he said besides this, an all-India Agriculture Coordinated Research Project had been initiated for which an award had also been instituted in the memory of the departed leader. Paying tributes to the late leader, Mr Nitish Kumar said he owed his present day position to Devi Lal and added that his Samata Party and the INLD were one and the same and all of them were members of the same family. He assured the farmers that the Central Government would do everything possible to ensure that the interests of the farmers were not adversely affected by the WTO. To ensure this, heavy duties had been levied on the import of wheat, rice and milk. The Government of India had recently also increased the import duty on edible oils for ensuring remunerative prices for oil seeds. He informed the farmers that their interests were safe in the hands of the present government led by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee who had recently increased the minimum support price for their wheat produce. A similar increase had also been ensured for the rabi crops which included mustard etc. This price policy would also be followed for kharif crops so that the farmers did not suffer any losses. Mr Nitish Kumar also said a new national agriculture policy was being implemented throughout the country and a crop insurance scheme had been specially launched in every state for farmers at the panchayats level so that the benefits of the scheme percolate to the grassroots. He advocated a policy which would ensure good value for the produce of the farmers and at the same time reasonable prices for the consumers. He stressed that farmers should also adopt cash crops and fruit production which would pay rich dividents. To encourage this, a fruit processing industrial unit at a cost of Rs 4 crore would be set up in Haryana, he declared. Speaking to mediapersons soon after the programme, he said 50 lakh tonnes of wheat would be exported this year and added that 150 trains were waiting in Bangladesh to be unloaded. He said despite drought like situation in the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Chhattisgarh, the country had ample stocks of foodgrains. He also said that a central team would soon visit Haryana to assess the losses incurred due to hailstorms and rain as the Haryana Government had demanded Rs 613 crore from the Centre. The Minister announced a financial assistance of Rs 30 lakh for the construction of the building of the institute and said the Union Government would bear its recurring expenditure and would also provide more grants from time to time. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Chautala said during the past 22 months crop loans worth Rs 3,420 crore had been advanced by the cooperative banks in the state and for the current year a target of Rs 2,380 crore had been set. Similarly, cooperative land development banks had provided investment credit of Rs 476.20 crore during the last 22 months and for the current year a target of Rs 300 crore had been fixed. He demanded an assistance of Rs 300 crore from the Government of India for clearing the balance sheets of cooperative institutions which were helping the farmers. The Financial Commissioner and Secretary, Cooperative Department, Mr M.K. Miglani, in his welcome address said the Institute of Cooperative Management coming up at Narwana was the 15th institute of its kind in the country and the first in Haryana. It would be built at a cost of Rs 1.50 crore and would cater not only to the people of the state, but even those from other states, he added.",{},"['tribune', 'rs', 'nitish', 'haryana', 'india', 'crore', 'cooperative', 'minister', 'agriculture', 'chandigarh', 'kumar', 'farmers', 'mr']","Nitish announces education projectK.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/6/2000 0:00,,"Communication must for nurses Tribune News Service CHANDIGARH, Aug 5  Communication is one of the most important nursing skills for it enables the nurses to understand the needs of the patient and deliver better care. This was emphasised by Mrs Rajinder Dhadda, Nursing Superintendent, General Hospital, Sector 16, while introducing the theme Nursing and Communication skills at GMCH-32. Effective communication on the part of nurses has a bearing on patient care, establishment of inter-personnel relationship as well as image projection, she said. Over 200 nurses participated in the conference organised today by the Trained Nurses Association of India, Chandigarh branch. Earlier, Dr V.K Kak, Director-Principal of GMCH-32, in his inaugural address said more emphasis should be laid on practical training of nurses to direct their efforts towards patient-oriented care. Nursing is based on establishing a caring and helping relationship by reducing the communication gap between the nurse and the patient. Participating in a panel discussion, Mrs Baljeet Kaur, Assistant Nursing Superintendent, GMCH-32, and organising secretary of the conference, listed the reasons as to why a nurse does not project a positive image in society. This could be because of lack of effective communication, adequate knowledge and information about other fields, power and authority and flexibility and adaptability. She further pointed out that nursing does not attract the best of talent as it offers no status, no good salaries and difficult working conditions. The shifts that keep them busy are responsible for the lack of interest in the profession. The panelists highlighted that the foundation of nursing lies in the communicative attitude. This attitude is manifested in striving for mutual understanding, coordination and co-action instead of striving for control over patient by manipulating them to behave in a specific way. A good nurse should have listening capacity so that she is able to identify the problem and help solve the same. For instance, a nurse listening to an anguished husband whose wife is critically ill is an example of communication. The discussion was chaired by Mrs V Pillai, Principal, Mata Sahib Kaur, Institute of GNM, Mohali. Speaking about the strategies for improving communication, Mrs Dhadda suggested that good literature should be made available for the nurses. Also a rich departmental library and use of computers should be inculcated. Besides such conferences, in-service education programmes should be conducted by the administration of various hospitals for the benefit of the nurses. The nurses need to be motivated to bring about the desired changes. The competence of the nurses depends on their ability to send timely and intelligent messages, hence they should constantly strive to upgrade their skills. Research studies have discovered that lowest death rates in hospitals were related to interaction between the nurse and the physician, and their response to the patients needs rather than the administrative structure, specilisation or teaching status of the hospital. The third scientific session was chaired by Mrs Shakuntla Kathuria, Nursing Superintendent of GMCH-32, and Mrs C Daniel, Nursing Superintendent, PGI. In this session, a role play was presented by the nursing staff of GMCH, which depicted the shortcomings in communication skills in clinical practice and strategies for improving the same. Later, educational activities for the coming year were discussed during the business session.",{},"['tribune', 'communication', 'nursing', 'india', 'nurses', 'mrs', 'skills', 'patient', 'gmch32', 'nurse', 'chandigarh', 'superintendent', 'session']","Communication must for nursesTribune News Service CHANDIGARH, Aug 5  Communication is one of the most important nursing skills for it enables the nurses to understand the needs of the patient and deliver better care.

Master, who has developed a book, which guides on how to succeed by mastering the art of writing the smart way, says when we write, we use the energy at our disposal to form letters. Later, our subconscious takes over and words flow without the use of energy. The law also stands true the other way round too, he says. In fact, one can write away ones way to success. Here is a lowdown on how, according to him, our brains make our hands work. Low self-esteem: A person who thinks low about himself, fears failure and change. Such people set easily attainable goals and fear taking risks. This trait is seen in the crossing of the letter t. The one who crosses the t bars very low on the stem suffers from low self-esteem, while those who cross it as high as possible also rank high on the esteem scale. Also, if the crossing is above the stem, the person is more theoretical than practical. Self-confidence: This trait is both a factor and barometer for success, also judged by crossing of the letter t. Here too, higher the crossing, the more prominent the trait. Another indicator is large capital letters. Those who begin their sentences with capital letters that are larger than the rest in the sentence make it to the top. Optimist: The writing of such writers who believe that the best is yet to come shows a noticeable upward slant in the entire baseline. The entire line of writing gradually slants upwards. Also, they cross their t bars not only high on the stem, but also rising upwards. Fear of ridicule: Watch out for the way you write the letters m and n. If the second hump of the m is taller than the first hump, you are self-conscious and fear being ridiculed, especially in the company of others. Interestingly, those who write the second hump shorter than the first, are diplomatic and can get way with telling pleasant things in a friendly manner. Concentration: Those who have small writing, which is legible and clear, have a tendency to focus on a specific thing at a time for an extremely long span. However, if the writing is illegible, it denotes traits of being disturbed, withdrawn and unproductive. Temper: It is said if you are angry you dont solve a problem but become one. Here too, the letter t reveals your explosive behaviour. Those who cross the t bar predominantly to the right of the stem are known to have a temper. Sensitive to criticism: If you take your critic to be your sworn enemy, you loop your t and d as Persistence: This quality is shown by the tie stoke, especially in letters f, t and a. Lying: This trait is disclosed by the loops in the lower case ovals a and o. Confusion: A confused mind is easily noticed from confusion in the writing. Such people suffer from lack of clarity in their handwriting. Organisational skills : The character that most prominently deciphers this trait is the letter f. A cursive f that has both parts in equal proportion denotes a well-organised person. Irritability: The persons who get irritated over minor issues and are bogged down by little inconveniences are likely to have the following handwriting. Known as slash trait, it s denoted by an ""i"" dot which is slashed or a and t bar which is slashed to the right. Determination: Such people are firm of purpose and get things done through and with others or all by themselves. Straight and firm strokes show this trait, especially in letters g and y. So one needs to do is to adopt positive trait strokes in your handwriting and thereby develop these traits in your personality or simply put write the letters differently to succeed.",{},"['trait', 'write', 'person', 'tribune', 'crossing', 'india', 'way', 'low', 'letter', 'letters', 'stem', 'chandigarh', 'writing']","The process of moving the thumb and fingers to form certain letters influences the thought process and behaviour of the individual.""

Not only has it succeeded in helping many to leave alcohol, the local chapter of AA is all set to organise the first-ever public information meeting here in less than a weeks time. The public information meeting is likely to be a path-breaking initiative, as those who have left alcohol for good are going to be role models for alcoholics. Although apparently the holding of a public information meeting may look like a simple task, there is going to be courage involved on part of those reformed alcoholics who are going to set an example for others. We are going to stand up in front of the gathering and tell them about alcoholism and how one can recover. And perhaps there cannot be a better example than us, who have managed to leave alcohol, he said. The special public information meeting, which is going to be held on August 29 at GMN College, Ambala Cantonment, is also going to mark the second anniversary of the Ambala chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous. Having started by only two persons, the chapter has grown from strength and strength. The success of the Ambala chapter of AA has led to another AA chapter being opened in Karnal. As a matter of fact, a businessman from Karnal had read a report on the Ambala chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous in Chandigarh Tribune and had joined up here. After reading the report in this paper, I came to the Ambala chapter. With their support, I have been going sober for the past couple of months, and now we have opened a chapter in Karnal so that more people can leave alcohol, the businessman said. The president of the Ambala chapter of Alcoholic Anonymous said that a number of participants are expected to attend the public information meeting. Alcoholic Anonymous members from Chandigarh, Punjab, including Jalandhar, Batala, Amritsar and Nangal and Haryana, including Karnal and Panchkula, are likely to attend the special meeting, he said. He stated that the meeting will be an effort to generate awareness about alcoholism. We are also reaching out to different organisations so that those who are suffering from alcoholism can recover. The WHO had declared in 1956 that alcoholism is a disease. The American Medical Association and the British Medical Association have accepted it as a treatable disease, he pointed out. An Alcoholic Anonymous member said that AA is a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences, strength and hopes with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fee for AA membership. We are self-supporting through our own contribution.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,5/25/2009 0:00,,"City Scope Letters Right blend clicked for Congress This refers to the City Scope The Congress has it! (May 18) by Raveen Thukral in which he has rightly said -The Congress has it. Really, for the first time since 1991, the party got clear majority, which was not expected this time. Though Congress is likely to provide us a stable government, I still fear if it would be able to deliver the expected. We have to discuss what brought the Congress to power. Apart from Modi and Karat there were several other factors too. I think this is a negative vote towards opposition and regional parties. They arm-twisted and never worked or allowed to work. So part of the blame comes on Karat and others. But minus the Red parties will the Congress perform? What Mamta has done in Bengal if done elsewhere, will it not hinder the progress? We should be happy that the Congress has got a better share of votes. The real deciphering of the election result is still due. We should also wait to see whether Sonia would be able to control the party and deliver for the welfare of the people. In the present circumstances, rising prices, meltdown and corruption are the major challenges for the Congress. I feel that there are chances that this government might tilt either way- it could be a big failure or a complete success. Kumar Gaurav, Chandigarh II The heading of this week City Scope should be The people have it instead of The Congress has it. It is not the Congress but the people who have done it. After many years of testing, people have rejected the leaders of fragmented regional parties, who claimed to be ruling the nation by a proxy presence. The results are simply unbelievable. All those who were putting Manmohan Sarkar to ransom have been thrown away. Though the Congress has thrown out Lalu and Karat, still Mamta and DMK are there to nail them. After twenty years people have voted for a single party and we hope that the party politics will stay here. The young factor has played well in the election. People have shown their faith for a stable government. Keshav, Chandigarh III People of India have given a clear mandate to the UPA to put an end to the political instability. The exit polls by the electronic media became a futile exercise. The Indian voters became wise while casting their votes for the right candidate. They rejected the national, regional parties, the third and the fourth front. The UPA government should think about growth by providing more jobs. The government must think of ways to control population so as to curb poverty. It should also check the price rise of essential commodities especially those of domestic use. The left parties, SP and other allies of the UPA should support the new government. People had lost confidence in the left parties and the BJP. They wanted to see good governance and better quality of life. The government should consider the predictions of the World Bank, which has warned that people would live under extreme poverty, in 2015. Dr Manmohan Singh who is considered a great economist has thus several challenges to meet. M L Garg, Chandigarh IV Its aptly analysed that the middle class, the youth and the Muslim vote that has helped the Congress and the UPA to emerge winners. Thus, proving all the exit polls and the poll pundits wrong. No one, including the players- the Congress and its allies- had an inclination that the pre-poll alliance would emerge strongly. Several other factors played a crucial role too. The Congress could muster the youth support because of Rahul Gandhi. The middle class polled for the honesty of Dr Manmohan Singh and trusted him to deal with the economic slowdown, safeguard the economy and pave way for growth and development. The Communists because of their outdated policies and programmes failed to protect the interests of the poor, weaker and the middle class. Their opposition of the Indo-US nuclear deal, too, went against them and thus their middle class and youth vote bank went against them. Harbans Singh Chopra, Mohali V The results of this years elections are unexpected. Since 1991, elections had been opting for fractured majority that created an impression that coalition governments would stay and power of regional parties was increasing. Things took a bad shape to an extent that disgruntled politicians played the worst politics. But, our democracy is strong and hence, the voters have shown the door to all sorts of manipulators. It has been mentioned by the writer that Modi and Karat factors eased the situation for the Congress. The Varun factor, blame game and Advanis greed to capturing the highest post has led to the BJPs downfall. The criticism of the Prime Minister has also worked in favour of the congress. The UPA is now in full force and I am sure that it will work. A wise man rightly said Manmohan SinghS would keep the seat hot for about two years and then the young leader would come. The Sonia factor will work and people are likely to get relief in the future. Rahul once said only ten paise out of one rupee reaches the right place, so will the UPA help the people to get more out of remaining 90 paise. As prices of routine products have increased, will the UPA be able to reduce the Consumer Price Index. They should learn that if they do not perform then the coming elections will be hard to win. R K Garg, Chandigarh VI Ideology and practice led to debacles of the BJP and Left parties. Mr Thukral has rightly said the figure of 260 seats for the Congress-led UPA was not predicted by any of the exit polls. Such a victory, especially when prices of essential commodities are skyrocketing, was not expected by the Congress or the UPA allies. The victory of the UPA de facto is not the victory of the Congress but is complete polarisation of politics in the BJP and the Left, particularly at the expense of regional parties. The communal cards of the BJP and the Leftists hide and seek policy led to their debacles. The BJP and the Left failed as their ideologies did not reflect aspirations of the voters and the tactics they followed during the campaign alienated their supporters as well. Also, the mandate has discarded the regional parties and parties like the LJP, the PDP, the MNS and the RPI could not open their accounts. The parties have not announced any concrete national policies and programmes for the people, moreover, all parties indulged in mudslinging. Though Varun Gandhi attained victory in Pilibhit, it was an overall defeat for the BJP . The corruption crisis in the Kerala unit of the CPM has been unprecedented. The Left Front governments in West Bengal and Kerala claim that private investment is required to generate jobs. Nandigram and Singur have raised serious doubts about the Left Front governments ability to attract private investment to West Bengal. The party leadership has all these years educated its cadre that private capital is inimical to the interests of the people and should be resisted at all costs. How long can a party remain trapped by the contradiction between ideology and practice. Further, the Left unsuccessfully tried to form a Third Alternative with those parties which were a part of the NDA under the BJP earlier. In the last general elections, when the NDA sought votes on the Indian Shining slogan, this led the next UPA government to focus on inclusive growth. Booming stock markets or upbeat economic data do not reflect the true picture of the country. Poverty alleviation requires long-term planning, increased spending on education, health and infrastructure and political commitment. Benefits of growth have to be evenly shared. This is a time for introspection, not only for the BJP/Left but for the Congress as well. The BJP and the Left, hopefully, will reformulate their politics to offer a constructive opposition in the Parliament. It is the time to consolidate the gains for the Congress. SK Khosla, Chandigarh VII Mr. Raveen has rightly highlighted the reasons that have brought in unexpected did not take the arrogance and obstinacy exhibited by Karat and his comrades on the issue of the Indo-US Nuclear Deal and the sustained, irrational opposition to the reforms that the Prime Minister wanted to usher in. Karat basically tried to create hurdles for the UPA as their party even propped up Mayawatis name as the next Prime Minister, knowing well that she has a dubious reputation for collecting funds. The BJP, also, did not help its own cause by tearing in to Manmohan Singh at a personal level. The Opposition, it seemed had no issues other than personal hatred for the Gandhi family and a scholarly and a dignified Prime Minister. The electorate, has very rightly, given them the boot ! M K Bajaj, Chandigarh VIII I do agree that it is combination of the middle class, the youth and the Muslim vote that has done the trick for the Congress and the UPA. People had taught a bitter lesson to the Communists this year who had stabbed the government over the issue of the nuclear deal by withdrawing their support at the crucial time. The voters had not forgotten the ugly episode and paid them back the same coin by routing them from the political field entirely. This gave an advantage to the Congress. Moreover, the BJP lost its reputation due to the fielding of LK Advani as its prime ministerial candidate, who indulged in unnecessary war-of-words with Manmohan Singh. Also, due to the communal policies of the BJP, the public had felt disgusted that was again an advantage for the Congress. Whereas, the Modi factor did tilt the Muslim votes in favour of the Congress and the UPA. The Third Front was certainly hub of power-hungry politicians who wanted to take over the reigns of the country, as has been aptly described by Mr. Thukral. This factor had turned the voters, especially the youth in favour of the Congress and the UPA. In totality, the voters were more educated than the politicians who wisely voted for a stable and a strong government at the Centre.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,12/2/2013 0:00,,"COMMUNITY Open House response Slums: UT Admn should nip the problem in the bud The recent demolition of Colony No. 5 by the UT Administration to clear the area of slum-dwellings was undoubtedly a daunting task, albeit it came at the cost of studies of school-going children and left many without shelter. To overcome the problem of illegal occupation of government land by the encroachers, the Administration must prevent squatters from pitching up tents in the periphery of the city in the first place. It is a common knowledge that they would gradually convert their temporary lodgings into concrete dwelling units. The Administration should act beforehand rather than putting into use a huge posse of men and machinery at later stage. Hardeep Singh Slaich, Mohali Emulate the Dhanas model It should be made mandatory for construction workers and those working in factories to live at the site of work. Area councillors should be held accountable if any illegal colony comes up in their respective areas. New and affordable housing units should be constructed in semi-urban and rural areas in the tricitys vicinity where migrant labour could live, just the way the government has constructed tenements at Dhanas. They should be provided with a cheap mode of transportation so that they could commute to and from their workplaces in the tricity easily. Dr HS Walia, Chandigarh Rehabilitation scheme, an invitation to slum dwellers Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali are steadily inching towards becoming cities of squatters. Mushrooming of slums will continue as long as a juicy carrot in the form of rehabilitation scheme, higher labour charges and an administration pledged to consider the interests of jhuggi dwellers exist. The migrants set up shanties in the city of their choice and turn the surrounding areas into open lavatories. Their unhygienic way of living and defecating in the open facilitate spread of diseases. Persons behind several crimes in the city are also traced to these slums. Slums have partially defaced the tricity and the further damage could be prevented only if a policy is formulated to check their growth. The rehabilitation policy has failed to serve its purpose and instead proved to be an incentive for slum-dwellers. For such policies, a migrant sets up a jhuggi at almost zero investment, gets a built-up residential unit, sells it and constructs another jhuggi at some other place. The vicious circle will continue until the UT Administration either scraps the rehabilitation policy or amend it to check its misuse. Dr Shruti K Chawla, Chandigarh Authorities need to be proactive The demolition of a slum, Colony No 5, will not ensure that Chandigarh lives up to its tag, the City Beautiful. If the Administration managed to get rid of one slum, another would soon crop somewhere else. The authorities need to be proactive. So far, it has been seen that they woke up to the occasion only after a large number of people has encroached upon the public land. By then, agents had appeared on the scene and ensured legal or illegal provision of civic amenities like water and power connections, sanitation system etc in the colony. Vote bank politics too come into play. If the Chandigarh Administration is serious about making the city slum-free, it ought to keep an eagles eye on encroachments in the city. Offenders should be nabbed at the onset only. Why wait till a slight trouble develops into a big problem? SK Khosla, Chandigarh Monitoring better than bulldozing People from densely-populated states of the country like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar find Chandigarh a lucrative and convenient option to settle down. They set up jhuggies on a vacant land without any fear of law. General public can play a major role in checking government land getting illegally occupied by such migrants. They should inform the Administration in case they suspect a slum-in-the-making on a vacant public land so that it could be stopped at the first stage. Better monitor than bulldoze. Yet another answer to the problem of slums and encroachment on government land is providing squatters with an alternative shed or shelter. Priya Darsh Growar, Mohali Demolition a temporary solution Even as the Chandigarh Administrations demolition drive in the Colony No 5 is a laudable step, it would only provide a partial solution to the problem of illegal encroachment. Reason: the Administration rehabilitated a lesser number of families than those uprooted. While those who got keys of small flats in Dhanas now have an alternative place to live, others would certainly be pondering over erecting a temporary structure somewhere else, may be in Chandigarh only. Shishu Paul, Chandigarh Ensure optimum utilisation of vacant government land It is commonly seen that the land belonging to the government, which remains vacant for a long period, is either encroached upon or turns into a garbage dump leading to spread of diseases and complaints from those living in its periphery. The vacant land can partly be used to make new parks and offices, of course with proper planning. The remaining land should be earmarked with fencing or barbed wire to prevent its illegal occupation. Meenakshi Lamba, Chandigarh Need to fence the vacant public land The problem of migrants from UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and some states of the South India coming to Chandigarh for greener pastures and occupying vacant government land continues to haunt the city administration. The political parties encourage migrant workers to occupy the public land and repeatedly assure them that the government will not act against them. Politicians tell these migrants, who have over a period of time become residents of the city, that they will fight for them and in return, they (encroachers) must cast votes in their favour as and when elections come. To ensure that in future, no vacant government land is illegally occupied by migrants, all the pieces of government land lying vacant in the city should be appropriately fenced with barbed wire and a notice displayed prominently that encroachment of the land would draws strict penalty/punishment. Offenders should be prosecuted without discrimination. RK Kapoor, Chandigarh Give voting rights only to legal residents To achieve a desired civic system for public convenience, the authorities concerned should be harsh towards offenders and override dubious political manoeuvres. Upholding ethics of serving citizens and not succumbing to dirty vote-bank politics hold the key. In my opinion, only the citizens residing in authorised houses/colonies need to be given the right to vote. Officials in the local government should show teeth if they come across an unauthorised colony emerging in their wards. MPS Chadha, Mohali Illegal colonies an outcome of Admns laxity The demolition of Colony No. 5 also brought to fore a glaring omission on the part of officials in the Chandigarh Administration, who had let the colony to come up by looking the other way. Illegal migrants took advantage of their laxity and occupied the available space. The Administration continued to be on the losing side as its precious land remained in illegal occupation. The squatters might have been shifted temporarily to other locations but one thing is certain, new such colonies will come up there too thereby posing problems for the Administration at a later date. MS Ishar, Mohali Ensure units allotted under rehabilitation scheme remain with beneficiaries I would like to say that the problem of slums can be addressed not by removal of jhuggies but by their transformation. If shacks are converted into houses, slums would turn into suburbs. Once it is done, the challenge will be to ensure that dwelling units remain with the beneficiaries under the rehabilitation scheme for slum dwellers and do not sold to agents paving the way for more encroachments; this time at some other place. Strict and competent officers should be appointed to keep a track of and tackle such encroachments. Isha Gupta, Chandigarh Admns bold step appreciable A ruthless anti-encroachment drive has eventually retrieved some prime land even as some local politicians tried to publicise their protests for obvious reasons. This belated but full-throttle action is ultimately for the overall betterment of the City Beautiful and city residents have welcomed it. The step will eventually increase the occupancy of flats built by the Chandigarh Housing Board in Dhanas at a considerable cost. The squatters were hitherto showing reluctance to occupy them. SC Luthra, MHC, Mani Majra Bureaucrats should be upright, not politicians puppet Most of the encroachments on the government land take place because of tacit understanding between politicians and the authorities concerned. It starts with a small shack and slowly grows into a house on a government property. Politicians turn a Nelsons eye to the unlawful activity lest they annoy the voters. Officials concerned toe the line of their political masters. In such a scenario, the answer to encroachments lies in being tough to offenders. The bureaucrats have to be upright and serve their organisation rather than politicians having vested interests. Encroachment must be removed as soon as it takes place or noticed. The recent razing of Colony No 5 in Chandigarh is a good example of a well-planned effort towards removal of encroachment. Now, the Administration should emulate the job in other places that are under illegal occupation. Col RD Singh (retd), Ambala Cantt Open house question Encroachments in markets has been a cause of concern for city residents. Recently, the UT proposed to the Centre to increase the fine on encroachers from ~500 to ~10,000. Would the increase in the penalty deter encroachers or other measures are required to tackle the menace?

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/18/2001 0:00,,"It was also found that even a genuine deed was hard to get registered without paying an unofficial fee to the officials. In case of non-compliance, the deed is put in the cold storage by raising illogical objections. In such cases, the buyer and seller pose as blood relatives. They obtain or forge certificates from the panchayat authorities for the purpose. It was found that in many cases only witnesses versions were accepted. This is the most common way to avoid paying stamp duty in the sale of agricultural land. The scandal involves officials from the patwari to the tehsildars and other registrars authorised to register the deeds. The other malpractice involves impersonation and falsification of the relationship between the buyer and the seller.

The farming community had been demanding this benefit ever since the government stopped this mode of transfer of property.

Ms Chandrawali also sold her adjoining lands measuring over 100 kanals on the same day to Ram Niwas and others at similar ridiculously lower rates. All these deeds show these lands as located outside the municipal limits. The total stamp duty paid amounted to about Rs 2.5 lakh compared to Rs 5.26 lakh paid for only 44 kanals in 1993. Thus the government was effectively deprived of stamp duty worth over Rs 20 lakh. The same land was then sold by his widow, Ms Chandrawali, to Mr Ram Niwas on July 22, 1999, for only Rs 5,80,000 by paying a stamp duty of Rs 72,500. The trick was that this land was shown in the sale deed as being located outside the municipal limits of Hisar. The sub-registrar who registered the deed accepted the plea. It is learnt that the prevailing rates in the area on that day were over Rs 5 lakh per acre.

The khasra numbers are 6470 to 6477 and 6480. The land was sold to Nand Ram Saini. Inquiries by The Tribune reveal that government officials, in addition to falsifying the location of the property, are showing the buyers and sellers as blood relations and allowing transfer of land through a decree. The government has specified deemed prices for properties in the municipal areas all over the state to rule out chances of undervaluation in a bid to attract lower stamp duty. Under the rules even if the buyer and the seller agree to sell and buy a particular piece of land at a lower price, the deed will be registered at the government specified rates only.

Khatra and IPL Kings XI Punjab owner Ness Wadia on May 23, the SSP has today given a scathing representation to the deputy commissioner (DC) alleging that he was subjected to verbal abuse. He pointed out that whole series of these IPL matches have been marred with the accusations of racial discrimination, use of liquor and flouting of smoking laws. The spat has also led to the Mohali police slapping a bill of Rs 1.75 crore on IPL for its services rendered during the matches, when, according to the SSP, IPL engaged in cross commercial activities. The bill has to be paid before the next match on May 28. Relating the incident that took place at the PCA stadium during the Kings XI Punjab and Deccan Chargers on May 23, (first reported by the Chandigarh Tribune), the SSP said besides abusing him, Wadia used derogatory language against the administration. The SSP added that Wadias parting shot was I do not want to talk to small and mean people. The PCA president I.S. Bindra who had come to resolve the spat was also reportedly present when this was said. The SSP and Ness Wadia had a heated argument when Wadia leveled serious allegations against the police. He had alleged that the police was marketing tickets in black and had stolen T- shirts and liquor. He had also alleged that the police were terrorising his men deployed in the stadium. Objecting to the allegations Khatra tried to reason with Wadia. I emphatically contradicted the allegations and pointed out that only 50 per cent tickets were sold and IPLs own men were selling the tickets during the ongoing match. When the tickets are available in ample at the sale counters how is it possible that people are purchasing tickets in black? I added that the private security personnel deployed by the IPL at the entry gates had not allowed any illegal entry into the stadium, held Khatra. Khatra alleged, It has been closely observed during the IPL matches that these were not played with the spirit to boost sports, however, it is established that the people connected with this tournament i.e. players, owners and BCCI have engaged to have pecuniary gains, said the SSP adding that IPL had engaged in a cross-commercial activities.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/13/2009 0:00,,"Kamla Nailed Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 12 At the receiving end of the alleged shoddy investigation into the rape of Nari Niketans mentally challenged inmate, the police today arrested Kamla (a sweeper) and Jamna Kumar, a security guard of the Nari Niketan in Sector 26, here today. However, the police action came in the backdrop of The Tribune exposing the lies of the police on Thursday that Kamla was attending to her duties at Nari Niketan. The police had been claiming that Kamla, who has been named in the FIR as the co-accused, had absconded. The victim had reportedly also hinted at the involvement of Jamna Kumar. When asked about the basis of arrest of Jamna Kumar, a senior police officer disclosed that the victim described him through gestures during questioning. She explained to the investigators that one of her exploiters had small moustaches, thin bearing, with baldpate and spectacles. The description matched with Jamna Kumar, leading to his arrest. He added that more persons, even outsiders, could be involved in the case. The Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by Kulwant Singh Pannu, arrested Kamla and Jamna Kumar. Sources in the police said the police carried out the entire process late last night after being castigated by the Punjab and Haryana High Court yesterday. The accused were produced before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Anshul Berry, who remanded Kamla and Jamna Kumar to two-day police remand. Seeking the remand of four days, public prosecutor Jatinder Pal Singh argued that the police had to interrogate the accused and find out whether other people were involved in the crime. The police required DNA samples of Jamna to match with the foetus to confirm whether he had raped the victim. Arguing the case, the defence lawyer for Kamla said, There is no cogent evidence against Kamla and she had already joined the investigation and there was no need to arrest her. Furthermore, it has not been proven as yet whether the crime has been committed at Nari Niketan or Aashreya. The police said Kamla and Jamna Kumar were arrested on the basis circumstantial evidence and other clues. A police officer said after the high court rejected the anticipatory bail of Kamla, it became imperative for the police to arrest the suspect. A senior police officer said the investigators quizzed staff members of both Aashreya and Nari Niketan. During the probe, the statements of the staff members, circumstantial evidence and other inputs pointed toward the role of the two suspects. The police so far found that the entry of males was restricted in the area where the victim was living in Nari Niketan and only Kamla had access to her room. It was alleged that she used to take her to the bathroom where she was raped. The Tribune had taken a lead in reporting the heinous crime since May 18 and raised pertinent questions on the security of these homes and the police alleged role to hush up the case. The police had already arrested Bhupinder Singh, a security guard of Nari Niketan on May 18, the day the heinous crime came to light. A medical social worker of Aashreya reported the matter to the police after the victim complained of pain in her abdomen. A case of rape and criminal conspiracy has been registered in this regard.",{},"['nari', 'arrested', 'tribune', 'singh', 'india', 'arrest', 'crime', 'kamla', 'victim', 'chandigarh', 'niketan', 'kumar', 'jamna']","However, the police action came in the backdrop of The Tribune exposing the lies of the police on Thursday that Kamla was attending to her duties at Nari Niketan.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/14/2006 0:00,,"Star donors felicitated on eve of Blood Donors Day Aditi Tandon Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 13 Every time a person goes to donate blood, he pledges a part of himself to someone else. Viewed from the prism of humanity therefore, blood donation is a supreme form of offering  one that gratifies both the donor and the recipient, and brings rewards to both. This day just showed how As scores of donors assembled on the lawns of Rotary and Blood Bank Society Resource Centre in Sector 37, it was difficult to determine whose contribution was superior. In the gathering were tall people some like Manmohan Sarin, who has donated blood as many as 89 times; some like Bhupinder Singh Thind who has defied the rules of age to continue donating blood against odds; and some like Veena Kapoor, who have set high standards for those in her league. In fact, all 80 individuals who were honoured at Blood Centre-37 on the eve of World Blood Donors Day (June 14) have a shared history of passion for the human life and for all that makes it worthwhile. For the only couple among the awardees  Manmohan and Niti Sarin  blood donation has been a way of life for as long as the two can remember. Together they have grown into worthy contributors to a movement that nourishes the very veins of nations. While Niti Sarin inherited the streak from her mother Kanta Krishen, the grand old face of blood donation movement in the region, Manmohan Sarin developed an addiction for blood donation. And he did not stop until he had made blood donation a family practice. Today, no celebration in the Sarin household is complete till the time blood is donated. It is our religion, our way of thanksgiving and our way of feeling healthy, says Sarin, whose wife Niti has donated blood 44 times. Equally passionate about blood donation is Bhupinder Thind, who first donated blood for his ailing wife. Until 1990 I had donated blood 14 times. It was post 1990 that I pledged to cross the 100 time mark. Since that year, I have been donating four times a year the maximum possible. I have reached 80, says Thind, whose passion was obstructed once when the PGI disallowed him from donating blood saying he had crossed the permissible age limit of 60. Determined to keep on donating blood, Thind reasoned with the authorities that he could donate blood till 65 years of age as mentioned in the literature for the promotion of voluntary blood donation. When the latter didnt oblige, he became a donor at Blood Centre-37. Today he walked out its campus as one of the rewarded star donors. Like Sarin and Thind, every blood donor of Blood Centre-37 had an interesting story to tell, as did heads of institutions that were rewarded for hosting blood camps and mobilizing over 100 donors per camp. Another category was that of star institutions which mobilised over 150 donors per camp or organised two camps in a year. Among institutions that wrested honours were St Johns Old Boys Association, Dev Samaj College, Sector 36, CRPF Camp, Hallomajra, Kamla Dials, Chitkara, among 31 others. The honours were done by Ms Asha Hooda, wife of Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda whose informal address was as heartwarming as that of Dr BNS Walia, Vice President of Blood Centre -37.",{},"['wife', 'tribune', 'donors', 'donation', 'donated', 'blood', 'india', 'times', 'sarin', 'way', 'donating', 'chandigarh', 'thind']","Star donors felicitated on eve of Blood Donors DayAditi TandonTribune News Service Chandigarh, June 13Every time a person goes to donate blood, he pledges a part of himself to someone else.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,4/12/2006 0:00,,"Alcoholics Anonymous, a fellowship of love minus lectures Charu Singh Tribune News Service New Delhi, April 11 Alcoholism is a disease that wastes itself out in numberless villages, small towns, cities and metropolises spread across the nation. While the alcoholics grapple with their addiction to liquor, their near and dear have to put up with the trauma of seeing their husband or son slowly degenerate due to the hold of alcohol. Statistics show that worldwide over two million people die each year due to alcoholism. Data collected by the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in India shows that this problem is growing at the rate of 7 per cent each year. Also, the sale of the AA big book worldwide is massive. This year, it has entered into its 25th millionth copy, second only to the Bible. Alcoholics Anonymous in a rather quiet manner is doing sterling work to keep alcoholics sober. This organisation is a collective effort on the part of former alcoholics to help those suffering from alcoholism and bring them back on the straight and narrow road to sobriety. The main thrust of this organisation was beautifully explained by a former alcoholic at one of the AA meetings. Since anonymity is the rule at AA, he is called Mr X, Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of love, of genuine caring for each other. No lecturing happens here at all, we are all sick of lectures. What counts is that we share each others stories, each others lives, our happiness and our sorrow. This is what helps us re-build. Another alcoholic who has been sober for the past 14 years and now helps keep his more vulnerable companions sober says, I joined AA in January 83 and then I had not come here on my own but was brought here by my father as though it was my first day at school. There were four-five persons here in this room then and I sat down in a bemused state. I remember there was this American lady who was telling her story. She said that she was a housewife whose husband gave her money for groceries and she bought groceries with half the money and spent the rest on alcohol.  A miracle happened that day as I realised for the first time that honest people existed in this world. I was very impressed with this newfound honesty and started coming back to AA in the hope of finding more honest people and sharing with them. This put me firmly back on the path to recovery. Mr V, a serious alcoholic who literally walked back from the grave to a decent sober life, says, I started drinking at the age of 16, I then took my first drink out of a feeling of rebellion. In those days I had this sense of alienation from society and I drank out of a feeling of loneliness. When I had my first drink it acted like magic and removed all feelings of alienation. It removed all my problems. With the passage of time drinking became my main activity. Mr V further elaborated, Then accidents started occurring. I started missing college. My family did all sorts of things. They took me to doctors, pundits, tantrics, they got me married. Nothing worked, my drinking just went from bad to worse. I could not work and my health degenerated. My father in desperation took out a circular saying he would have nothing to do with me. I had hit rock bottom in those days. I wanted to stop but could not and became suicidal. Finally, one day when I was collecting trash to sell and buy booze I saw an Alcoholics Anonymous advertisement. I came to the meeting. V says that, It was the love and attention I received here that worked. It slowly gave me the confidence to rebuild my life and stay sober. I took my last drink on December 24, 92 and have stayed sober ever since. I came to the fellowship a wreck and a 100 per cent failure and today in recovery, I feel Im a 100 per cent success.",{},"['fellowship', 'sober', 'tribune', 'started', 'love', 'india', 'v', 'anonymous', 'took', 'chandigarh', 'alcoholics', 'mr', 'aa']","Data collected by the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in India shows that this problem is growing at the rate of 7 per cent each year.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/30/2007 0:00,,"Be a smart broke You are trying to save for the New Years eve big bash, but the universe seems to be conspiring to tempt you into spending. Worry not, helps here! Purva Grover I ts not even the middle of the month and your ATM card reads low balance. The moolah that came in on Diwali went away as easily as it came in. And now, your buddies are planning a big bash on December 31, for which you have to make a contribution. Plus, there is the ideal designer outfit that you spotted in a window last week. Hmm now the issue is, as always, to save money. And, you are quite good at it. For, you do it every time theres a birthday, a holiday or a party to attend. So, you decide to get back to your diet of noodles and sandwiches to save bucks. Wait, what if we tell you that there are smarter ways of living on a shoestring budget. Dont believe us? Well, take a clue from smart tips here and see the content of your piggybank grow each day: * You are bankrupt and thats leaving you sad. Now, we all know that a retail therapy works wonder when it comes to cheering you up. But, it lightens both your mood and your wallet. So, heres a way to indulge without spending. Hunt for outfits, shoes, belts, shades and everything else you wish to have in your best pal, cousin or neighbours wardrobe. With her permission of course, and a promise, that youll let her do the same when she is penniless and is dying to buy a new dress. * Each time your mom and aunt talk about how they picked up a dozen of oranges for Rs 2 less, you label it as silly conversation. But well, heres your chance to gain from the bargain talk. Pick on easy tips from them and haggle for the best deal. Dont be embarrassed to fight for a rupee. After all its your hard-earned money. * Your idea of celebration is to drink in a fancy pub, but then it costs huge bucks. So, keep your eyes wide open and enjoy a drink at places that offer discounts. Say, pay a little more and change your cola for a chilled beer. Or order two vodkas and get a peanut salad free. Or, buy a bottle of Old Monk, preferably from CSD, grab a packet of wafers, troop into a buddys place, make a bonfire and have a splendid low-budget evening! * Hate waking up in the morning to wash your car? But paying 200 bucks to the cleaner also pinches. Strike a deal with your friend or the cute-guy in the neighbourhood and take turns to wash it or maybe do it together. * And see, if you are an Indian, a true Indian, then the word FREE should be enough to lure you. So grab all those samples that come with magazines, products and even the ones that are distributed in the local market. Trust us, the orange juice tastes best when it comes absolutely free and the detergent too cleans the better when the salesman gives it as a free gift. * Okie, now this may sound unexciting, but not all freebies are sub-standard and boring. Buy a shower gel that gives a loofah free or denims that give branded pair of socks free. Or subscribe to magazines that promise an electric kettle or trendy handbag. * Take advantage of the free checkups that your organisation or the private clinics arrange. But, of course, use your judgment when you go in for these. * Are you a movie-freak? Now, if all you need is an outing for three-hours and popcorns to munch on, then lookout for free movie screenings in the city. If you are lucky, you might actually get to watch a good one. And whats more, if you dont mind walking into the theatre rubbing your eyes, then morning shows are just perfect. They let you park yourself on the best of the seats for almost half the price. * This one is for all you foodies. If one or two servings are too little for you, then place an order for an eco-thali, a combo meal or still best gorge on a buffet. Check out the happy hours at many eateries and place your order to get a heavy discount. Eating at a dhaba or getting yourself invited for dinner to your bhuas, chachis, boring landlord, colleague or friends place is a good idea. * Shopping from wholesale markets or from stores like Subhiksha, Reliance Fresh, Six Ten, Dollar Store is definitely a budget-friendly idea. * You thought you were jinxed when it came to winning at Tambola, scratch-n-win cards or writing a slogan or SMS contests. So you stayed away from them. Well, try your luck, for it might just work in your penniless days. From scanning the papers for contests to playing lucky dip in the college fetes, do it all. * Tele-callers chose to call you either when you were searching for your car keys or when you were in a meeting. So you shout at them and hang up. Well, this time dial customer care and take note of all the money you can save with an SMS pack or a Friends-Family pack and more. * Want to save on fuel? An ideal fitness option is to walk and enjoy the pleasant weather. Or become a hitchhiker (at your own risk) or make sure that the innocent you is at the gate looking for a rickshaw when Mr Sharma takes his car out of the parking. Hell be happy to offer a lift (of course, till he discovers your plan) Now, this last one is for those who would go to any extent to save the precious source of energy  SMS or call for a free test drive and step out at the superstore from a swish car.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,5/5/2006 0:00,,"Does the city have a sports culture? Sansarpur saga, with its magical success in hockey, made Jalandhar a sports hub. Anuradha Shukla speaks to a cross section of sports personalities to know if the city is living up to its past glory Rajbir Kaur, the Golden Girl of Hockey She credits the former sports wings in schools for making the city as sports hub. On the women sports, she feels that it is highly neglected with the complete absence of academies, wings or any department for developing the skills of women sportspersons. According to her, the sports wings earlier had helped the girls from rural areas in developing their sports skills as these used to help them feel comfortable in coming and staying in hostels and avail facilities to go all out and perform. The total lack of attention or facilities for the female sportspersons is affecting their performance in the states like Punjab. Merely promoting games for the men and ignoring the section cannot develop sports culture,she says. The awareness among parents about sports for women is not translated into results because of the lack of facilities that resulted into the sportswomen taking up the sports at the time when it is required to help them get admissions or jobs only, she feels. Palwinder Kaur, kabaddi coach The sports centers, and the former sports wings in schools have served as fertile nursery for sports talent. Over the years, these have created unique sports culture, wherein persons like me have come from remote rural backgrounds and done well, she says. The city is a positive example of how the sports talent from different regions has been absorbed to make it the hub of sports activities. Parents from rural centers do not hesitate to send their wards to the city, as there are maximum hostel facilities available here, she says. With the reopening of the sports wings in schools and colleges by the state sports department, which were closed for the past few years, the scene is set to liven up once again. The colleges like the HMV have been allotted sports wings and this has greatly enthused the sporting fraternity. The wings will once again provide much needed channel for the sports talent to come up. This time, the government has provided more funds and infrastructure for the wings, which is a welcome step. Ram Pratap, athletics coach He rates Jalandhar the best when it comes to sports, as, he says, the city provides the maximum facilities for any sports activity as compared to other cities of Punjab. The increasing facilities have brought more and more games to the city over the years. Ram Pratap, the athletics guru and the president of the Punjab Coaches Association, does not feel bad about the attitude of the youths from the poor and rural families of Punjab, who take to sports to get settled with a good job. He says it only encourages sports. Once in secure jobs, the urge to work for the victory of the country increases, he feels. In athletics, the sports stars like Olympian Manjit Kaur and Rajwinder Kaur have proved their mettle despite the lack of attention for women sports, he says. The intake of sportspersons into the police, the BSF and other government departments also encourages sports activities in the city. He also feels that the so-called urbanite games like badminton, table tennis, snooker, and cricket are now drawing children from the urban middle class families in the city. Jaspal Singh, football coach Being the centre for professional teams like the Punjab Police, BSF, CRPF, and for various colleges like the KMV, HMV, Lyallpur Khalsa and the DAV, and at school level, the city makes the sports scene very dynamic, he says. The sports culture lives in the city with various Olympians and Asian-level players residing here, he feels. Jaspal Singh, the noted football coach from Lyallpur Khalsa College, says that the parents from the city, specially from the middle class, are sending their children towards sports, as they think the field is more professional in approach and would help their children get money or jobs easily. The working of sports wings in schools, sports departments of colleges, academies and the clubs adds to the sporting charm of the city, he says. He stresses on the fact that more work needs to be done at the grass-roots level. However, he rues that this is not being done because of faulty government policies. Om Prakash, swimming coach As far as the sports activities are concerned, the city, in his eyes, is the number one. The stalwarts of hockey produced by the villages like Sansarpur add to the sporting charm of the city, he says. However, he feels that swimming and gymnastics are the corner sports here as the city lacks the facilities for these games. Om Prakash, a coach with the Sports College here, has witnessed the sports scene in the city being revived over the past three years. He has been credited with many success stories like Rohit Jamba, Gagandeep Kaur and Chandeep Singh from the city. He feels that the inclination of the people towards the games is more highlighted by the media. The number of Olympians in games like hockey produced by the city also pushes children into these games, he feels. The more conscious parents want their children to adopt sports. On the parents attitude, he says that most of the people coming to him for giving training to their children want their wards to be tension-free so that they could adapt to the modern day lifestyles. The parents here are very conscious of the fact that their children need sporting activity for their all-round development, he says. Baljit Kaur, hockey coach There is no dearth of sports talent in the city. A large number of them can be found in any sports ground or during the trials of any sports tournament here, she says. Be it easy jobs through sports or admissions through the sports quota seats, the considerations for the parents here vary for sending their wards into sports, she says. Parents from the city do not want their children to stick to books to become doctors or engineers, as they feel that mere studies are not going to help their children in any field of life. This is very encouraging. This attitude would surely help in making city youngsters good sportspersons. The games like kabaddi, which is getting cash prizes and recognition, is attracting children, she feels. The increasing competition has also made the sports field more vibrant in the city, where, she feels, the soul of sports lies. The children are coming to the city specially to take up games like hockey, she says. The city surely does have a sports culture and it shows.",{},"['games', 'tribune', 'coach', 'india', 'wings', 'kaur', 'children', 'feels', 'facilities', 'chandigarh', 'hockey', 'parents', 'city']","Palwinder Kaur, kabaddi coach The sports centers, and the former sports wings in schools have served as fertile nursery for sports talent.

The manifesto promises clean drinking water, public libraries for senior citizens, better parking facilities, sanitation and installation of CCTV cameras at strategic locations. While this manifesto has been released for all seven MCs put together, BJP leaders, in all the seven MCs of Panchkula, Ambala, Yamunanagar, Karnal, Panipat, Rohtak and Hisar, released separate manifestoes highlighting the local issues which will be addressed if the BJP comes to power in the MCs. Sharma added that the party was fielding candidates in 121 wards and supporting four others while the other seats have been left open for its alliance partner, the Haryana Janhit Congress. They are free to contest these seats though the leadership of the HJC has already decided against contesting the MC elections on the party symbol. The Congress, without officially contesting on the party symbol, is going all out to show its strength, Sharma claimed. Promises better water supply, sewerage system Karnal: The BJP, contesting the Municipal Corporation elections on party symbol, has promised corruption-free governance and single-window system for civic facilities, including approval of building maps and implementation of citizen charter. Releasing the manifesto for the MC poll, party leaders said the drinking water supply would be regularised in all areas, sewerage system extended to all colonies and parking problems and strengthening of fire brigade would be given priority. CCTV cameras would be installed at all crossings and other locations and maintenance of civic services would be entrusted to ""Resident Welfare Committees"" and the corporation would fund these committees. Karnal BJP president Askok Sukheja said a four-storey building would be allowed in all areas, including the HUDA sectors, a master plan would be prepared for constructing cheaper houses for the poor and all building constructed on 150 Sq Yard plots would be exempted from house tax. The manifesto also promised construction of flyovers within the city to decongest traffic, installation of water treatment plant and streamlining of civic services. Sankalp Patra out Hisar: BJPs national spokesperson Captain Abhimanyu today reiterated that his partys alliance with the HJC was strong and intact. Abhimanyu was here to release the election manifesto of the party for the June 2 MC poll. He said the recent visits of senior BJP leaders to enquire INLD Supremo Om Prakash Chautalas well being were social meetings and people should not see any politics behind these meetings. Terming the forthcoming MC poll as important for the states politics, the BJP spokesperson said the results of these poll would have a bearing on the coming parliamentary and assembly elections. Releasing the partys manifesto, Abhimanyu said the party had given it the name of Sankalp Patra. He said after winning the poll, party candidates would be committed to ensuring sanitation, supply of pure drinking water, sewers and other basic amenities to residents. Abhimanyu said before coming to power, the Congress had promised to waive House Tax in Haryana. Slip-up on water tax The seriousness with which the BJP is contesting the MC elections today stood exposed when Ram Bilas Sharma committed a faux pas, promising a rollback on water tax which does not exist in Haryana. In a press conference, he said, ""If elected, we will ensure that water tax goes"", though the manifesto made no mention of this. ""Ill-briefed and ill-prepared for the conference, Sharma, when asked, was clueless that Haryana had no water tax. However, BJP leaders attributed it to a slip-up while Sharma maintained that he ""meant waiver on water bills for slums"". While mentioning this, Sharma probably does not know that the High Court has directed the state government to collect bills from all consumers.y",{},"['tribune', 'party', 'mc', 'tax', 'manifesto', 'water', 'haryana', 'india', 'elections', 'sharma', 'poll', 'chandigarh', 'bjp']","They are free to contest these seats though the leadership of the HJC has already decided against contesting the MC elections on the party symbol.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/25/2011 0:00,,"An ex-judge, housewife, hardcore politician main contestants Raman Mohan/TNS Hisar, November 24 For the first time in 43 years, the Adampur Assembly constituency is witnessing an electoral contest in which the three main contestants come from different backgrounds. While Congress nominee Kulbir Beniwal is a politician having represented the erstwhile Bhattu Kalan constituency for about four years from 2005, HJC-BJP candidate Renuka Bishnoi is a housewife. INLD nominee Ram Singh Baswana is a former judge. Uptill now, the Bhajan Lal clan, which has managed to keep this constituency within the family fold for 43 years, had faced challenges from politicians only. Renuka is trying to retain the seat for the Bishnoi family vacated by her husband, Kuldeep Bishnoi, after winning the recent byelection to the Hisar Lok Sabha seat. Even though this is her maiden electoral contest, she understands the intricacies of an election fully. Our entire family is well entrenched in politics. I have learnt that politics is simply a way to serve our people. So anyone who wants to serve the people should be in politics and being a woman or a housewife is no bar to it, she says. To INLD nominee Ram Singh Baswana, having remained a judge is an advantage. Having dispensed justice to the people during my service period only makes my resolve to undo injustice done to the people of Adampur stronger, he says. His entire campaign is based on the theme of justice for the people. He says: Even after 64 years of Independence the number of BPL families has risen to 50 per cent of the population. The Congress has ruled the country for 52 years but it forgets all about the poor and the needy after it is voted to power. This is the biggest injustice . Congress nominee Kulbir Beniwal was at one time a protégé of the late Bhajan Lal. He has since drifted away from the Bishnois. However, it is more of a contest between the parties than the candidates. The HJC wants a win both to reinforce the impression that along with the BJP it will provide a credible alternative to the people in the next assembly poll and to keep the seat within the family fold. The INLD, on the other hand, is determined to further its recent performance in this assembly segment when the party bagged over 28,000 votes here during the Hisar Lok Sabha byelection. Former Chief Minister Om Parkash Chautala has toured the area extensively. INLD Secretary-General Ajay Singh Chautala is leading his partys campaign. The Congress has roped in every senior party leader for the campaign. The party has established three different teams for campaigning that are sparing no effort to reinforce its position in the assembly segment. It had suffered huge losses in this segment in the recent Hisar Lok Sabha byelection. The party managed to poll just 15,000 votes as against 42,000 polled in the 2009 Assembly elections. Under the circumstances, the candidates themselves have been relegated to the background. No wonder unseemly oral duels between senior party leaders have become the main highlight of the campaign. The Chautalas are alleging that the Bishnois and the Congress have made an unholy alliance and are trying to fix the election like a cricket match. They also allege that the Bhajan Lal family has always exploited the people of the area by playing the caste card, thereby vitiating the political atmosphere in the area. The Bishnois, on the other hand, maintain that the Chautalas have never been able to defeat any member of their family in any constituency in which they faced each other, including Bhiwani, Adampur and Hisar. The Congress is assuring the voters that that if the party nominee wins, Adampur will see unprecedented development. The Congress is currently engaged in winning over those families which had voted for the party in 2009 but have since crossed over to opposite camps. The campaign is led by Randeep Singh Surjewala, Dharambir Singh and Sampat Singh.",{},"['tribune', 'constituency', 'party', 'singh', 'india', 'inld', 'family', 'nominee', 'chandigarh', 'assembly', 'congress', 'hisar', 'campaign']","While Congress nominee Kulbir Beniwal is a politician having represented the erstwhile Bhattu Kalan constituency for about four years from 2005, HJC-BJP candidate Renuka Bishnoi is a housewife.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,4/5/2012 0:00,,"COMMUNITY Alcoholism playing havoc with families Pradeep Sharma Tribune News Service Chandigarh, April 4 The shocking incident of an alcoholic government official shooting at his 22-year-old daughter in Sector 41 here recently has once again brought under sharp focus the deadly disease of alcoholism, which is playing havoc with the lives of drunkards and their families. Families try all means to control the menace that has sunk deep into the fabric of their lives. An alcoholic does not listen to any counselling. An elders comment is seen as unnecessary interference and wifes comments are dumped as emotional blackmailing. A retired colonel, wishing anonymity, said: ""The problem of alcoholism is very peculiar and the best treatment for chronic alcoholics does not lie in visits to doctors or even police stations as was very common. I saw the evil serpent of alcohol consume lives and destroy families during my career. In my own family, I saw my son sinking every day, into oblivion, because he was trapped in the dark alley of drinking."" Colonel Singh said: ""My son started drinking when he joined an engineering college in Nasik. He got a decent job in an MNC in Gurgaon and during his days there he entered a path of self-destruction. He lost his job and, in fact, lost himself as he would keep himself locked in his room and repeatedly ask for alcohol. He even got violent and at one point of time, I pushed him out of the house because he hit his mother."" ""Life became unbearable because his drinking sessions would start early mornings until I met a retired university professor with whom I shared my life. He goaded me into attending a session of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Honestly speaking, I did not hope for anything there. I was forced to come for the second meeting and I saw a little hope when I heard some people share their personal experiences, on their return journey to normalcy. I made an attempt at getting my son who relented after persuasion of more than a month. He was still drinking even when he went to counselling because I would give him money when he came to attend a session. After about three months, one evening when I took out a Rs 100 note to give him he said: ""Papa, I dont want to drink."" I kept looking at him. He started crying and gave me a bear hug. This was three years ago. He has not drunk till date. He has joined an office at the IT Park. His job is not as big as it was at the MNC, however, he says he has made a beginning and will find his way. Even as different sections of society, including policy makers, the police and NGOs debate ways and means to control the menace of drinking, help is at hands in the shape of the Alcoholics Anonymous(AA), a fellowship of recovered men and women, who share their experience, strength and hope with one another that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. Recovery from alcoholism, once nearly impossible, is now routine provided the problem drinker follows a simple spiritual programme suggested by the AA. The recovery programme of the Alcoholic Anonymous works on simple 12 steps of which attending meetings, which are held in different parts of the tricity everyday, formed an integral part. The alcoholic is not a bad man but a diseased man and like diabetes the disease can be arrested one day at a time. In fact, alcoholics have an allergy of the body, the overpowering craving for alcohol once some has been introduced to their body. Even the World Health Organisation, American Medical Association and the British Medical Association have accepted alcoholism as a progressive, fatal disease which has not cure till date, but can be arrested on a one day at a time basis. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for gaining the AA membership. The AA is self-supporting through our own contributions. The AA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organisation or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; and neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety, a member said. Though the AA has no opinion on any outside issue and does not wish to engage in any controversy yet we collaborate with the government and NGO to check the menace of alcoholism in society, another member of the AA said.

His traffic record also included a 2006 speeding rap.Friday’s outcome clears the way for Phelps—whose 22 Olympic medals include 18 golds—to resume his return to top-notch competitive swimming.Due to the six-month suspension imposed by USA Swimming in the days after his arrest, Phelps will not be taking part in the 2015 world swimming championships in Russia, his attorney Steven Allen told the court.However, Phelps “is in the process of training for the upcoming Olympics” in Rio de Janeiro, said the lawyer, who gave no further details.Police pulled over Phelps in a white Range Rover SUV after he was clocked doing 84 miles (135 kilometers) per hour in a 45 mph zone in Baltimore’s undersea Fort McHenry Tunnel.After the arresting officer whiffed alcohol in the vehicle, Phelps underwent a breathalyzer test that found a blood alcohol level of 0.14 percent—well above the Maryland legal limit of 0.08 percent.Within hours, as news of his arrest got out, Phelps went on Twitter to acknowledge his error and express regrets to his fans—but gave no hint of any alcohol issues.His appearance in Maryland District Court—minus the beard he sported in a cheerful Thanksgiving family photo on Instagram—was a celebrity moment in a morning when Braverman was otherwise shoveling through dozens of routine traffic cases.Phelps said nothing as he arrived with his mother Debbie, his two sisters and former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, a local hero and close friend of the six-foot-four (1.93-meter-tall) swimmer.Allen took pains to stress Phelps’ involvement with youth groups, saying his client understood he was a role model and that he wanted his misfortune to stand as a lesson to others to beware the dangers of drink.Leaving the courthouse, after paying $57.50 in court fees, Phelps told reporters that the past three months had been among the hardest in his life.“I am happy to be moving forward,” he said, as a chauffeured black SUV waited for him and a member of his entourage waved off a couple of autograph-seekers.“I’ll continue to grow from this and continue on my path of recovery,” he added.“These couple of years are going to be very challenging.I’m very pleased and happy that I have the great support that I have around me.” AFP",{},"['dodges', 'alcohol', 'driving', 'jail', 'maryland', 'suv', 'case', 'swimming', 'drunk', 'told', 'braverman', 'baltimore', 'usa', 'traffic', 'phelps']","Baltimore (USA), December 20Olympic swimming great Michael Phelps looked to the future, including the Rio Olympics in 2016, after he dodged a stint in prison for drunk driving.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/4/2009 0:00,,"Firms submit fresh expension plans Tribune News Service Shimla, June 3 The government today said contrary to misconception that existing industrial units were closing down, many pharmaceutical companies had submitted fresh proposals for expansion of their activities within the hill state. An official spokesperson said here today that it was wrong to suggest that many existing units in the state were closing down as the Single Window Clearance and Monitoring Authority had approved many new projects. A Rs 57 crore expansion project of the Servotham company and Rs 5 crore of Micro Labs had been approved at the recently held meeting, he said. He said the Cabinet at its last meeting had approved extension of incentive of concessional rate of central sale tax (CST) at the rate of 1 per cent for all industrial enterprises beyond March 31, 2009 or till the time the CST is phased out by the Centre. He said 152 medium and large-scale units and 240 small-scale units with an estimated investment of over Rs 3000 crore and employment potential of 25,000 persons had been approved so far. Big names like Ranbaxy, Dr Reddys, Dabur, Wallace, Cadila, Alkme, Hellos, Cipla and Life Health have set up their units in Himachal which is an indication of the industry-friendly environment existing in the hill state, he said. He said reduction of excise duty from 16 to 8 per cent and later to 4 per cent had not decreased the interest of entrepreneurs as this was not the sole motivational force to set up units in Himachal. Several other factors like uninterrupted power supply, improved infrastructure and connectivity are still attracting investors, he said. He added that the state governemnt had time and again taken up the matter regarding restoring the special industrial package till 2013 with the Centre. Flawed norms affect fund allocation to HP Rakesh Lohumi Tribune News Service Shimla, June 3 Flawed norms for allocation of funds under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna (RKVY) are affecting flow of funds to states with higher plan spending on the agriculture and allied sectors. Under the existing norms, 50 per cent of the funds under the scheme are allocated on the basis of percentage increase effected in plan spending on agriculture and allied sectors every year. The provision hurts the interests of states already making a higher allocation and some of them are rendered ineligible for funding. The objective apparently was to encourage states to increase allocation for agriculture. However, in case of Himachal Pradesh, the allocation was already on the higher side and it could not be increased any further. As such, it will not be able to secure higher allocation on this account under the existing norms. The state has allocated Rs 299 crore for agriculture and allied sectors in a plan of Rs 2,700 crore (about 11 per cent), whereas the national average was only 4.17 per cent. Even major agriculture states like Punjab are spending only 5 per cent on this account. Secretary, agriculture, Ram Subhag Singh has already taken up the matter with the central ministry concerned and drew its attention to the anomalous system of fund allocation. The state could not increase the allocation any further as it would have to curtail funds for some other important sectors. The ministry is convinced with the states plea and it has agreed in principle to take up the matter with the Planning Commission, which has evolved the norms. The state has been allotted Rs 24 crore for the current year, but it wants the norms reviewed so that it is not rendered ineligible for funding next year and made to suffer for higher plan spending. Similarly, 30 per cent allocation is made on the basis of expected growth rate of agriculture. In case of Himachal Pradesh, the projects growth rate is only 0.9 per cent and as such it does not qualify for higher allocation. Further, 20 per cent funds are allocated according to the percentage of the un-irrigated area, which is quite large but fades into insignificance when compared with large states. Under the present norms, 1 per cent increase in plan spending brings over Rs 15 crore of additional allocation, but a state has been reached where no further increase can be effected. With the Union Ministry of Agriculture appreciating and endorsing its viewpoint, the state hopes that the Planning Commission will review the norms. Villagers accuse IPH of ignoring water problem Kuldeep Chauhan Tribune News Service Mandi, June 3 Dispute over distribution of water supply between two villages under the Balh police station yesterday took a political colour as Rajvari villagers accused the Irrigation and Public Health (IPH) Department and the police of listening to interests of BJP-minded contractor and Naitla villagers, thus ignoring the water problem being faced by them. The dispute between the warring villagers took a political colour, as the Rajvari villagers are led by Jagriti Rana, sister of Congress president Kaul Singh Thakur, and the Naitla villagers enjoyed the support of schemes contractor Vijay Kumar, son of a local BJP leader Adan Kumar. The Rajvari villagers charged that the IPH and police departments were siding with the contractor as he enjoyed political shelter ignoring the root cause of the problem. The present water scheme of 1.6 inches pipeline to Naitla village would starve them to death as the entire water source just had that capacity and Rajvari village also depends upon this water scheme, they rued. The issue hot up after the police registered a case yesterday under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act against four Rajvari villagers, including Jagriti Rana, charging them of damaging public property by breaking pipeline of the water supply scheme. On the other hand, the Naitla villagers pleaded that they were demanding enhancement in water supply as the village has been facing water shortage. But certain political elements within both villages do not want to settle the dispute amicably, some villagers contended. Executive engineer, IPH, Baggi, ND Vaidya claimed that he had not called the police to the spot and passed the buck on the contractor. I have no verbal idea about the exact nature of the scheme, I will check-up papers, he added. Mandi SP Sonal Agnihotri said the police was sent to the spot as it apprehended some law and order problem as the villagers were stopping work by pulling the pipeline being laid by the IPH department. The police has no role to play as it is the IPH Department which is executing the scheme, the SP said. 75 crore spent on water schemes Our Correspondent Bilaspur, June 3 Rs 75 crore are being spent on drinking water and irrigation schemes here in the district during the current financial year and officers must ensure that all targets in this matter are achieved with speed and efficiency.

Mandi MC accused of selectively issuing demolition orders Kuldeep Chauhan Tribune News Service Mandi, June 3 The Mandi Municipal Council (MMC) has locked horns with the towns RTI Bureau as well as district dalit Congress cell on over demolition notices issued by the council to 57 town residents, most of them dalits. The issue has assumed political overtones after the BJP dalit cell pledged its support to the council. MMC has acted in a partisan manner and selectively choosing easy targets by issuing notices to the residents. This has been done to save its skin from the high court order asking the council to take action on unauthorised structures and report compliance on the matter, charged RTI bureau president Lawan Thakur. Citing a copy of the high court order, he claimed MMC was beating about the bush as the court order has asked the council to furnish a list of all violators and take action against them. However the council has adopted a pick and choose policy, targeting only soft targets to save its skin from the high court, he said. The RTI bureau had claimed orders to demolish encroachments was not the duty of MMC but that of the revenue department as the council had no land in its name in the town. Threatening to move court if the town & country planning department did not give them relief, Thakur said there was no policy for rehabilitation of poor residents. Its a pity the council has failed to protect such residents and has instead begun targeting them, while the big fish go scot-free, he remarked. Dalit Congress cell president Chaman Rahi blamed the BJP s well as the Himachal government for targeting Dalits. In response BJP dalit cell president Balak Ram accused Rahi of misleading people as it was a court order and the government and party dont come into the picture. On the other hand MMC president HR Vaidya claimed the council has issued notices to 57 violators under section 211 of the Municipal Act asking them demolish unauthorized structures. The affected residents can appeal in the court. The council has not adopted any pick and choose policy in issuing the notices as the violators have encroached on government land. Notices to violators in 288 other cases will follow suit, he added. Tension again at Tanda college Our Correspondent Kangra, June 3 Tension prevailed at Dr RP Government Medical College, Tanda, last evening when a youth whose both legs were trapped in a power tiller was referred to the PGI, but no driver was available for the ambulance to shift him to Chandigarh. According to report, Santosh Kumar (28), a resident of Shungal village, near Palampur, met with an accident in the agriculture field when a power tiller attached to a tractor penetrated into both his legs damaging bones and blood vessels. He was rushed to the Tanda medical college where doctors said it was an unmanageable case and referred to the PGI, Chandigarh. There were number of ambulances available at the Tanda hospital, but no driver was available, which infuriated the relatives of Santosh who raised anti-government and anti-hospital management slogans. They held a demonstration against the government. Ravindra, Santoshs sister, alleged that they had been hankering after the authorities for a driver for two hours, but to no avail. My brother is sinking carrying a heavy power tiller in his legs but no driver is available to drive him to the PGI, shouted Ravindra. After the demonstration, the hospital management arranged a driver and the patient was shifted to the PGI. Medical superintendent Dr Bhano Awasthi said there were three regular drivers, one driver on contract, one home guard driver and two on deputation. He, however, said two drivers were sick, but within half-an-hour a driver was made available to the patient. He said the patient was discharged at 8.10 pm and the driver was available at 8.50 pm. Himani Kapoor regales audience Tribune News Service Shimla, June 3 She might excel in casting a spell with her typically folk and catchy foot-tapping numbers, but it is the soothing and comforting Tibetan and Chinese music, which helps famed singer Himani Kapoor to relax and unwind. Himani who made a beginning by participating in in various musical programmes on television like Sa Re Ga Ma Pa was the star attraction of the Shimla summer festival on the opening day on Tuesday night. Making big name in the field of playback singing she had the audiences dancing to her tunes as she presented a mix of folk and popular Hindi film songs. I enjoy all kinds of music but it is the calming Tibetan and Chinese music which I tune to when I want to unwind, she says. Having performed in Dharamsala and now in the Queen of Hills, she says breathtaking scenic beauty of the state brings out the best in an artist. She made an appearance on stage around 9.30 pm and regaled the audience with songs like samajh gaye ne main, tujhe dekh dekh sona and many other numbers. Locals as well as tourists started dancing as she rendered one song after the other. Himani said she never aspired to be a singer as she had set her eyes on being an interior designer. It was the participation in various television contests that paved her way to the Bollywood. I am indebted to my fans who helped me make a place for myself by sending SMS in my favour, she says. She has already done playback singing for six Bollywood films while three are in the pipeline. Prior to Himanis programme local artists, including Amit Gautam who presented pahari naatis and the Ankur Kala Manch from Mandi with their special presentation of Duluri folk dance enthralled the audience. The presentation by the Palavi Musical group and ghazal singer Pravesh Nihalta was also greatly appreciated. Children from local schools also presented their items. Even though great effort has been made to improve the stage, lighting and sound system but the acoustics were not up to the mark. State to get 50 miniature Pahari paintings Tribune News Service Shimla, June 3 The National Museum, New Delhi, will provide 50 rare Pahari miniature paintings to the state for displaying them at the Kangra Arts Museum, Dharamsala. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between Dr Daljeet on behalf of the Centre and Director of the Art, Language and Culture Department Prem Sharma for the state at New Delhi. Prem Sharma said the state had taken up the matter with the Union Ministry of Culture in 2002 and persistently followed after the present government came to power. The rare paintings are specimen of miniatures from Kangra, Basoli, Bilaspur and Chamba. The Kangra Museum will be enriched by these paintings and provide an added attraction to international tourists visiting the valley, he added. The paintings would be brought here soon and displayed in the museum by September. All paintings would be got insured and galleries illuminated properly with adequate lighting system for display of paintings. A temperature of around 22°C would be maintained in the museum to provide protection to paintings from moisture. Relative humidity would be maintained between 50 and 55 per cent. The National Museum would provide all conservation and restoration services for these art objects. A national seminar would be organised at Dharamsala in September on miniature paintings in collaboration with the National Museum. Sharma said the department had signed an agreement with the Janjatiya Akadami, Baroda, under which a research centre on Himalayan studies would be set up at Jamta in Sirmaur district. The government had already transferred 50 bighas for the research centre that would conduct studies on Himalayan folk, arts, culture, music, folklores and other related issues. He said that Indira Gandhi National Open University would provide degrees and certificates to the students of the research centre and it would be developed as a centre of excellence of the Indira Gandhi National Open University for which enrolment of students would start from June, 2010. Plays for curbing pre-natal sex determination test Tribune News Service Shimla, June 3 Nukkad nataks (street plays) and workshops will be organised across the state to create awareness among people about the need to maintain a healthy sex ratio and curb the illegal practice of pre-natal sex determination test. Presiding over the state-level Advisory Committee meeting on pre-conception and pre-natal tests, director, Health and Family Welfare Department, Sulakshana Puri said the scenario in the state was quite satisfying as far as child sex-ratio was concerned. As per 2001 census the ratio is 896 is to 1,000, which was better than the neighbouring states. Junga, Bali-chowki, Kalpa, Nerwa and Pangi were the top five tehsils in keeping the ratio towards the higher side. The state had launched various schemes including Indira Gandhi Balika Suraksha Yojna and Mother Teresa Asahai Matri Sambal Yojna for the uplift of women in the state, adding that there is a provision to provide Rs 25,000 and Rs 20,000 to the parents of the girl child who adopt terminal family planning methods after the birth of the first girl child and second girl child, respectively. A provision for giving reward of Rs 10,000 to any person providing information pertaining to female foeticide in private or public clinics. The government would collaborate with the states of Punjab and Haryana to evolve a joint strategy to stop female foeticide. Briefing about the PNDT Act Dr Sunite A. Ganju said about 500 inspections of ultrasound clinics were conducted during the last year, 19 clinics were sealed and licence of eight clinics were cancelled. Convention on Alcoholics Anonymous Our Correspondent Manali, June 3 Around 300 recovering alcoholics and their families will participate in a three-day annual convention of the Alcoholics Anonymous to be held here from tomorrow. Talking to mediapersons here today, members of the association said the Alcoholics Anonymous was a fellowship of men and women who shared their experiences, strength and hope with each other so that they could solve their common problems and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for being a member of the organisation was the desire to stop drinking. There were no dues of fees for the membership. The fellowship was self-supporting through its own contributions, they said. Generation tax on hydro power sought Tribune News Service Shimla, June 3 Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal has urged the Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee to address the issue of generation tax on hydro power, which has been hanging fire for the past over three decades, in the regular budget for 2009-10. In a letter to him he pointed out that the Rangarajan Committee had accepted the demand of the state and specifically recommended imposition of generation tax on hydel power. The report had also been accepted by the Planning Commission as well. He reminded the minister that he supported the legitimate claim of small states for levying tax on hydro power generation under Article 288(2) of the Constitution of India. He said that the state had negligible mineral resources and hydel power potential and forests were the major natural resources available. The state had been getting 12 per cent free power only on the hydropower projects commissioned after September 7, 1990 and not from the projects completed earlier, which included all the Bhakra Beas Management Board projects. He said equating generation tax with 12 per cent free power or the rate of royalty on minerals was unjust, illogical and unfair. He said the revenue which would accrue to the state on account of the proposed tax would be simply insignificant compared to the royalty on minerals being disbursed to the mineral rich states. Dhumal said the state had suo motu imposed a ban on felling of green trees in the larger interests of the country as a result of which it was losing substantial forest revenue. The states total forest wealth was valued at about Rs 1.50 lakh crore and it had never been adequately compensated for this recurring loss. He said that the state was committed to protect the environment and it had also banned use of polythene bags and from August 15 this year use of plastic bags of all kinds. The 12 per cent free power from hydroelectric projects was for the distress caused due to submergence of land and dislocation of population. Additionally Article 288 of the Constitution of India provided a source of income for the states where hydroelectric power projects were located. It was estimated that the generation tax would fetch additional revenue to the tune of Rs 150 crore. TCP Department to be computerised Tribune News Service Shimla, June 3 The government has decided to computerise the functioning of the Town and Country Planning (TCP) Department so as to ensure greater transparency, accountability and efficiency in the process of granting approvals for building plans. The decision was taken at a meeting held under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary, Town and Country Planning and Urban Development, last evening. Officers of all departments concerned and the local municipal corporation were present in the meeting. In the first phase, the entire process, right from submission of application to approval, will be computerised. It will enable applicants to ascertain the status of their applications and know about objections, if any, through the Internet. The entire process of issuance of no objection certificates for setting up mobile towers, monitoring of unauthorised constructions and court cases will also be computerised. A personnel management information system, a budget and accounting system and a grievances redressal system will also be put in place. Geographical information system (GIS)-based solution for development plans will be implemented in the next phase. Similarly, citizen-centric services of the Municipal Corporation, Shimla, will also be computerised. The model will be replicated in case of other municipal bodies to improve the public services delivery mechanism. The data regarding violation of building plans and encroachments will also be made available on the web and it will be linked to the planning permissions for proper monitoring and ensuring accountability. In the final phase, the building maps will be digitised and the applicants will also be asked to submit computerised building plans. Eight killed in factory blaze Ambika Sharma Khera (Nalagarh), June 3 Eight persons, including a fire brigade official and a home guard jawan, were killed and over 20 injured when a massive fire broke out in an air-condition manufacturing unit, Adventec Coils Private Limited, at Khera-Dadi village, near Nalagarh, last night.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/13/2003 0:00,,"Hamara School Philanthropy is hallmark of Sector 40 school Tribune News Service Arvind Kumar, Class VIII-F Rohit Singh, Class VI-G Sandeep, Class VI-A Chandigarh, November 12 Philanthropy has become the hallmark of Government High School, Sector 40, which is running a number of educational projects to benefit slum children with a special focus on the girl child. While the school caters to students staying in and around Sector 40 and nearby villages and colonies, it has gone out of the way to give back to society whether it is by way of ""Bori se Basta"" started in 1995 to educate rag-pickers from adjoining slums or the ""Chalo Beti School "" project aimed at imparting education to the girl child. These projects, along with Aasra, whereby students collected donations for the poor, were pioneered by Mr Bahadur Singh, Headmaster of the school for over 10 years when the school evolved into a centre for such activity and carved a niche for itself. Started as a primary school with 1,100 students in 1984, the school was upgraded to a middle school in April 1994. Next year, more classes were added and it acquired the status of high school, with 2200 students on roll. Computer education is given to students from Class VI onwards. With a campus not big enough to accommodate all classes, the school works in two shifts. Classes for the senior section are run in the mornings while students of Classes I to V attend school in the evening shift. A night school, started in 1999, is also run on the same premises and has 45 students. The school has an enthusiastic lot of students who participate in all activities ranging from painting and quiz to debates, declamations and sports. The school also boasts of students who have represented the city in the national games. W ith 28 years of teaching experience behind him, the Headmaster of the school, Mr Nand Lal Chawla, is clear on how he has to run the school. Emphasising on discipline, he wants the school to strive for academic excellence as well after making a mark in other activities. * On what education means: Education does not necessarily restrict itself to books. Rather, wide in scope, it means developing the all-round personality of children. It also means that the schools have the additional responsibility of enabling a child to evolve as a better human being. * On the tuition menace in schools: There is a growing need to check tuitions, especially since these have become a status symbol for the well-to-do. Tuitions are taking a toll on the classroom culture and students are losing respect for their teachers. In my opinion, if students are attentive in class and go through their books regularly and thoroughly, there is absolutely no need to dole out money for these extra classes. * On the role of co-curricular activities: While academics are important given the present set-up, a student needs to be active as far as participation in co-curricular activities is concerned. We send teams for every contest and encourage participation of one and all. In sports, too, we partonise kho kho, volleyball and kabaddi. * On the future plans of the school: We want to organise programmes on de-addiction and educating slum children on the ill-effects of alcohol and cigarette on a large scale and on a regular basis to ensure that they give up their habit. Besides, the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan is likely to get under way shortly.",{},"['tribune', 'classes', 'sector', 'started', 'class', 'india', 'students', 'activities', 'way', 'education', 'run', 'chandigarh', 'school']","Started as a primary school with 1,100 students in 1984, the school was upgraded to a middle school in April 1994.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/14/2003 0:00,,"Alcoholism a family disease: expert Aditi Tandon Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 13 Dr Elaine McDowell has long been Americas answer to the menacing alcoholism and drug problem. Ever a trailblazer, this first woman and the first-ever African-American woman to chair the Alcoholics Anonymous worldwide, with over 28 years of experience in administering, treatment, research and prevention programmes in the alcohol, drug abuse and mental health fields, still views her achievements as meagre. For the world outside, however, the strategies she developed for prevention of alcoholism during her tenure as Deputy Director, the National Institute of Drug Abuse and acting Administrator of Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration in the US Federal Service, are most significant for the positive impact they generated among the afflicted and the affected. Arriving in Chandigarh to chair the 32nd National General Service Conference of AA opening tomorrow, Dr McDowell, twice the recipient of the Presidential citation (from George Bush and Bill Clinton) for her expertise in tackling alcohol and drug problems in America, Canada and Africa, described alcoholism as a family disease. Surveys confirm that against every suffering alcoholic, five people known to him are affected. The number of people suffering indirectly could thus be staggering because one out of every 10 drinkers in the world is an alcoholic. In the given scenario, where alcoholism continues to be a major public health enigma throughout the world, Dr McDowell begins by stressing the need to understand the factors that perpetuate the problem. Genetic factors are extremely critical. A person born with these is at higher risk to be an alcoholic than others in the population. Along with psychological factors like depression and social factors like meagre income, genetic factors can accentuate the problem tremendously. The primary solution lies in identifying high risk groups and helping them accept that they need solutions which are offered heartily at AA. Significantly, 140 million alcoholics still walk the earth, but AA knows of only 2.4 million. Assessing the situation vis-a-vis India, Dr McDowell, said, During my nine years of association with AA as its nonalcoholic trustee, I have developed faith in its power to cure the world. The Fellowships greatest strength is its singleness of purpose. That explains its growth in India. Where in the first 44 years of its inception since 1958, it could motivate about 400 members, in the recent past it has added 25,000 members working in 700 groups. People are reaching out we, at AA, dont preach. We only share. Its through the power of sharing that AA has managed 50 per cent success rate in relapse prevention. Having devised successful programmes for children of alcoholics and drug abusers, besides establishing national substance-abuse treatment and prevention programmes for pregnant and parenting women and their infants, back home in the USA, Dr McDowell advocates the need to develop culturally-sensitive strategies that can be replicated across the world, with minor adaptations. Also the former leader of the international team on substance (alcohol or drug) abuse prevention training to 22 nations at regional sites in sub-Saharan Africa, Dr McDowell stresses the need to design a curriculum that naturally inspires young minds towards sobriety. The American educational institutions have incorporated factors of alcoholism and drug abuse in curricula. India can do the same, so that children grow with risk factors and their consequences on their tips. Looking forward to collective healing through AA, she added, AA is a fellowship which men, women, youth, with all their insecurities, can join with an assurance of support. Let them remember that this is the movement which brought recovery to countless alcoholics across the globe. Kicking the bottle Yoginder Gupta Tribune News Service Chandigarh, November 13 Avinash (not his real name), a well-dressed progressive farmer of Haryana, confidently walked to the podium and declared that he was an alcoholic till two years ago. He had been drinking for 25 years. Alcohol was his best friend, better than his job, his family and everyone else. I needed alcohol to wake up. With two pegs inside me, I could think better or so I thought. I continued to drink even when doctors diagnosed me as suffering from acute jaundice. Sometimes I broke bottles, to lift them again the next day. My relationship with God was that of contempt. I considered myself to be God. Then I heard about Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and attended one of its meetings. Till then I used to think I would not be able to quit drinks and, moreover, what I would do without alcohol as life was empty without it. At AA I was surprised when I saw people laughing and happy at 8 p.m., that too without drinking. Life changed after that. My obsession with alcohol is gone. Now I try to find my humble place in Gods scheme of things. Ms Jaya (identity changed) had no hesitation in admitting that till she joined AA, she thought anger and irritable behaviour were the gifts of alcoholism. But now she had learnt that alcoholism was a disease and she was not its cause. She had also learnt how to deal with a patient suffering from alcoholism. Ms Rachna (not real name) said she was a child of a disfunctional family as her father was an alcoholic. Arguments between her father and mother were a routine.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,12/28/2009 0:00,,"Asha helpline cries for help Anuja Jaiswal Tribune News Service Chandigarh, December 27 The literal translation of the Hindi word asha is hope, but practically Asha -- a helpline started by the UT administration to help depressed people in the city -- is hopeless. The aim of the ambitious 24-hour helpline, started in 2004, was to counsel people suffering from depression or having suicidal tendencies and preventing them from taking the fatal step. However, after initial success, official apathy has taken its toll on the helpline which needs support if the administration intends to continue with it. After a complaint from a conscientious citizen, Col Mehndiratta (retd), that the helpline was not working, The Tribune made inquiries and found that the project was hardly functional. On the morning of December 25, Mehndiratta had spotted a youth, who appeared disoriented, moving about aimlessly in Sector 11, Panchkula. Mehndiratta, after a brief chat with him (name withheld on request), realised that the youth was apparently depressed and needed counselling. Since Mehndiratta was aware of Asha helpline, he immediately called them up. However, he did not get any response. I must have called them up over two dozen times, but no one answered the phone, he said. To crosscheck these claims, this correspondent called up on ASHA helpline several times over the past two days but the calls were not answered, except once. However, the woman who answered the call was of no help as she point blankly refused to counsel anyone on phone or at the residence of the person in need of psychological help. She even refused to admit the patient on the plea that the doctor was not available for the next few days. When contacted, Dr Vijay Girdhar, psychiatrist at the Civil Hospital, Mani Majra, who heads the helpline, admitted that he was not available in the hospital for the past two days as he had been out of station to attend a conference. He also admitted that the helpline phone numbers were non-functional for the past few days, but were now operational. We dont have facilities like the GMCH-32. We are running the helpline, but dont have infrastructure for intensive care, as it is a primary health care-cum-civil hospital. Even we cannot help abandoned and mentally ill persons with high risk of suicide, Dr Girdhar admitted. He said, the department of psychiatry of the Government Medical College and Hospital, which was assigned the task of running it earlier, was not only running a helpline to counsel depressed people and tackle those suffering from suicidal tendencies, it also provided additional service of the Community Intervention Team (CIT). He, however, said this was not possible at this hospital. The CIT helped distressed, abandoned and mentally ill persons with high risk of suicide, to reach the protected and caring environment of the hospital. CIT had trained staff, a counsellor and a staff nurse, an ambulance with a driver, who had been trained to assist CIT staff in resuscitation and transportation of people with multiple injuries and fractures, said Dr Girdhar. Besides, the team was also summoned if a person had taken overdoses of drugs, put his life to threat or even to counsel people with high suicidal tendencies, he added. The psychiatry department of the civil hospital has no such facilities and no separate ward for such patients. We are restricted to attend calls only and counsel the patients on phone. However, we sometime face problems due to absence of required staff, said Dr Girdhar. Now, the question is if the hospital was not equipped with infrastructure to handle the helpline, why did the UT administration shift it out of GMCH-32, where it functioned effectively for more than four years? Dr Raj Bhadur, director-principal of the GMCH-32 said it was a decision of the Director Health Services (DHS) as this project was funded under the District Mental Health Programme.",{},"['phone', 'tribune', 'help', 'india', 'asha', 'dr', 'helpline', 'counsel', 'mehndiratta', 'hospital', 'chandigarh', 'staff', 'girdhar']","Asha helpline cries for helpAnuja JaiswalTribune News Service Chandigarh, December 27The literal translation of the Hindi word asha is hope, but practically Asha -- a helpline started by the UT administration to help depressed people in the city -- is hopeless.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/11/2008 0:00,,"EDUCATION Poor coordination mars admission process at UBS Smriti Sharma Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10 Students seeking admission to the University Business School, Panjab University, stand to lose out on lakhs of rupees due to the uncoordinated admission process. Lack of coordination among the different quarters of the university is likely to delay the admission process. The first big question that has been baffling the officials is the definition of NRI. It is pertinent to mention here that The Tribune had reported about the matter and the university had then sought legal opinion. The legal retainer, Anupam Gupta, in his nine-page opinion had suggested to study each case individually. Further, he had maintained that a standing committee should be assigned the task to determine the NRI status in each individual case and should not be left to the whims of individuals in each department. The vice-chancellor had constituted a standing committee under the chairmanship of the DUI, S.K. Kulkarni, to determine the status of NRI students and to work out certain parameters for the same. But with the DUI on leave for a fortnight, the committee has not been able to meet and decide about the same leaving the fate of NRI students hanging in balance. There are 19 NRI seats in the UBS and nine in PUBS, Ludhiana. Not only this, the university authorities were supposed to decide upon eight seats under the sports quota for which 64 candidates applications were to be scrutinised and the list of eligible candidates was to come from the office of the deputy director of sports. The UBS sent its first letter to the directorate of sports in April this year and even after repeated reminders, the list hasnt reached the department adding to the delay. Also, the candidature of those under the freedom fighter and Kahsmiri migrants categories is yet to come. Even after that happens, three seats, one each for single girl child, cancer patient and AIDS patient, would still be left undecided for which the clearance is awaited from the university authorities. So far, the UBS has only been able to complete group discussions and personal interviews of 1,029 students in the general and SC/ST categories. The department is under immense pressure to declare the results of the general category as in the next two weeks, around three B-Schools are starting with their last lap of the admission process and in order to save one academic year, the students will be forced to choose these colleges over the UBS. Chairman of the department Dinesh Gupta said, The moment we receive the results/clearances by the coordinators of various categories, we will display it on the web and notice boards. There is no delay on our part. Vice-chancellor Prof R.C. Sobti said, All lists will be sent to the UBS within a day or two without any further delay, he assured. PU sells prospectus sans application form Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10 Buying a prospectus from Panjab University turned out to be a nightmarish experience for a student today when she found that the prospectus that she bought for Rs 1,100 didnt have the admission form in it. Indu Sharma, a Dera Bassi resident, went to the university to buy prospectus for BEd (correspondence course). After making a payment of Rs 1,100 at the bank counter, she opened the booklet and found the admission form missing. She went back to the counter and asked the official on the counter about the same. Instead of listening to her compliant, the official yelled at her and told her that she should have checked the prospectus at the time of purchasing and refused to give her another prospectus. At this, the girl started crying and people gathered there. Immediately the advisor (examinations), A.K. Bhandari, and dean, students welfare, Naval Kishore, rushed to the rescue of the girl. On the orders of the vice-chancellor, Naval Kishore bought the girl another prospectus and sorted out the matter.

Fire Safety Educational institutes flout norms Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10 Educational institutes functioning from market places in Sectors 36 and 38 are flouting fire-safety norms with impunity. A team of the fire and emergency services committee of the municipal corporation led by mayor Pardeep Chhabra conducted surprise checks at over a dozen institutes in Sectors 36 and 38. The team was surprised to know that the fire-safety norms were not being followed by the institutes. The team noticed that one of the institutions had blocked the terrace of the building with a grill which could prove dangerous in case of an eventuality. Chawla said taking serious view of the lapses, notices would be served on the institutions and if the institutions failed to meet the fire-safety standards, strict action would be recommended against them.

They also have good prospects and salaries. The multi-city road show, which is scheduled for Delhi soon after, will showcase career and education opportunities as well as lifestyle and economic benefits available in Western Australia. The vocational courses are career-oriented and carefully designed in collaboration with the industry. We have a very friendly and safe multi-cultural society in Western Australia with high standards of education and health care, minister Quirk added.

COURTS District Courts Police remand for Bright Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10 Chief judicial magistrate Kanchan Mahi today remanded Nigerian national Bright, accused of duping several persons through a million-pound Internet lottery scam, in two-day police custody. According to sources, senior police officials will interrogate the foreign national. Balbir Singh, an MBA student of Phase 3B-I, Mohali, had lodged a complaint with the UT police on June 4 alleging that he had been defrauded of Rs 1.81 lakh by representatives of UK-based company United Kingdom Online Promos on the pretext that he had won a £ 1 million lottery. Balbir told the police that he received an email from drawnoticetiws@dodo.com.au <mailto:drawnoticetiws@dodo.com.au> on May 11 informing him that he had won an award of £ 1 million during a draw held on May 9. He replied the mail and was told to pay Rs 1.81 lakh in four installments on one pretext or another. To catch the suspect red-handed, the police asked Balbir to call the companys representative to Chandigarh to collect the money. The plan succeeded and Bright walked right into the police trap. Acquitted Additional district and sessions judge Ravi Kumar Sondhi today acquitted Ranjit Singh of attempted murder charge after witnesses turned hostile. According to the prosecution, during a dharna at Matka Chowk, the accused had entered into an altercation with the victim, Balwinder Singh, over the volume of television in a tent on June 3, 2005. Ranjit stabbed the victim in the chest with a knife. Thereafter, a case of attempted murder was registered against the accused. During the course of the trail, the accused was also sent to mental hospital last year. ADMINISTRATION Rules for mobile tower installation notified Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 10 The Chandigarh administration has the paved way for installation of mobile towers on non-residential buildings owned by it, semi-government organisations and autonomous bodies. Notifying the rules, the administration has said the towers will be shared by at least three mobile companies and the cellular operator will have to put up monopole towers on the institutional premises. The operators will have to obtain separate permission from the administration after obtaining the consent of the company that is erecting the tower on terms and conditions to be decided on case-to-case basis. The total height of the pole from ground zero will not exceed 30 metres and for towers on the rooftop of the building, the height of the building shall be reduced by permissible 30 metres. The size of the generator room will be 11.49x7.06 metres, including the area of pole and shelter room and its components. The generator will have to be noiseless and conform to environmental laws and guidelines. The final permission to install the towers will be granted by the single window committee. After approval from the committee, the application will be sent to the plan approval committee for issuance of formal orders and the rent deed will be signed with the UT administration for a period of five years. The deed can be subsequently extended in future for three years each on such terms and conditions that will be decided by the administration at the time of every renewal. The site will be used only for setting up towers and generator room. No commercial activity will be permitted. If the company that has put up the tower fails to pay the lease money to the administration within 15 days from the expiry of the due date, the administration will be free to disconnect the essential services to the tower and remove it without giving any prior notice. The rent will be prescribed on case-to-case basis by the finance department and the rent will increase by 5 per cent every year.",{},"['university', 'tribune', 'admission', 'prospectus', 'service', 'today', 'india', 'students', 'career', 'counselling', 'chandigarh', 'singh']","Career counselling is a personalised process that combines both intuitive and cognitive techniques to help one understand himself/herself, explore career options and attain the desired career goals.

Thats probably why the second term of the Congress rule in Haryana has ushered in a new trend in communication-letters. The issue of lop-sided development seems to have been carried forward from the governments previous term with the states Finance Minister Capt Ajay Singh Yadav and former Minister and MLA of Tosham Kiran Choudhry upset over the poor cousin tag for their constituencies and districts. After expressing his reservation on the land acquisition move in Rewari and backing the cause of the aggrieved farmers in a letter to Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda a fortnight back, Yadav is learnt to have sent yet another letter to the CM-this time for a university in his home district. Unhappy with the inequitable distribution of universities in Haryana over the past many years, sources said this second missive has dwelt at length on the need for a university in Rewari, a demand raised at a rally addressed by Hooda in the district in the recent past. Stating that the existing post-graduate regional centre in the district should be upgraded to a university, sources said Yadav had listed the concentration of universities in a few districts, with particular emphasis on Rohtak, Jhajjar and Sonepat. Mentioning that Rohtak had two universities and the prestigious IIM was also coming up there, the letter says Sonepat and Jhajjar had been lucky in getting an education city, two universities and an AIIMS institute. It goes on to state that the central university at Mahendragarh was at the far end of the district and would serve little purpose. Hence, a university in Rewari was a must. Districts represented by Chief Ministers have always been lucky with Hisar now having three universities, the latest one being set up for veterinary sciences. Sirsa, too, has a university. Kiran Choudhry too, has been demanding a sports university for Bhiwani and has met the Congress top brass in Delhi in this regard along with her daughter, Shruti, who is an MP. In a separate letter, Choudhry, upset over the inaction on upgradation of schools in her district, is learnt to have written a letter to Education Minister Geeta Bhukkal. Choudhry had, in the Budget session of 2010, sought to know from the minister why the upgradation of schools had been hanging fire.To this, Bhukkal had said that the department was in the process of finalising a policy for upgradation of schools and the demand would be met if the schools met the requirements laid down by the new policy.

These youngsters from the Institute for the Blind, Sector 26, are an exceptional bunch and they bring their own special gifts to life as they play their parts proving they are better than the best. There is an air of heady excitement during the rehearsals and the 22 youngsters cluster around chatting, giggling, singing songs and enacting their roles in perfect tandem with one another. Each one has a story to recount about being here, about having learnt how to act. But it is not easy. You cannot just tell them to act. You have to explain everything physically, picking up their hand, telling them how to hold it, but it is amazing how intelligent they are and how fast they pick up, smiles Mrs Reva Gandhi, who is a member of the Inner Wheel Club of Chandigarh and is a volunteer. She had also been a part of their acting endeavours last year when they had staged a play on the life of Sant Kabir. Stories from the lives of great men like Swami Vivekananda and Kabir work positively in the minds of these youngsters, explains Ms Gandhi, a fact that is reiterated by what one of the actors had to say. Eighteen-year-old Shiv Kumar is one of three youngsters essaying the role of Swami Vivekananda in this play and to him has gone the distinction of playing Swami Vivekanands years in America. Last year, he had played Kabir. While acting, I really felt I was Kabir. Some roles just come into ones heart and I really tried to mould myself to this great saint. I tried to imagine how he would have dealt with situations while acting them out, he said with an earnestness that is inspiring. Shiv Kumar wants to be an actor and not being able to see is not a stumbling block in the least. I love acting because it helps get rid of inhibitions, he smiles. His best friend Rohit (21) is the music composer for the show and can play the harmonium, tabla, keyboard and even the banjo. Music is his passion and he is determined to be a music director or singer one day. So, what did he keep in mind while creating the music for this play? I try and ensure that the melody I create is neither too classical nor too modern so that it doesnt sound odd. It should fall easy on the ear, he says with remarkable poise like an expert. Sitting next to him is chatterbox Devi Singh who plays the role of Ramakrishna Paramhans but loves Bollywood songs. The play has evolved from director, producer, actor Shekhar Sens two-act musical mono-theatrical production by the same name. Ms Gandhis fellow helper Meetika Chauhan reworked the script which was then cut down to a little over an hour and divided up amongst the children by Indra Chibber (former Joint Secretary of the Institute and a former teacher at Vivek High School) who also got it converted into Braille. Indeed the zest and the poise these youngsters display is stirring for not only they play their parts they also know how to have lots of fun. They also teach us, in the process, how to really appreciate life. The play will be staged on November 28 at the DAV College Auditorium, Sector 10 at 11.45 am.",{},"['tried', 'play', 'tribune', 'really', 'acting', 'youngsters', 'life', 'india', 'music', 'vivekananda', 'chandigarh', 'swami', 'kabir']","Visually challenged pick up acting skillGayatri RajwadeTribune News Service Chandigarh, November 25Hope floats and catches each of these special children in its wake as they come together to present a theatrical production on the life of Swami Vivekananda.

The Tribune...Saturday Plus Head,,,None,,"Wasted lives Addiction to medicinal drugs has reached alarming proportions in the region. The worst hit are our young adults. Social action on a war-footing is required to save them from ruin, says Jaya Bhardwaj T here is an air of adventure associated with it but it is a road that always leads nowhere except self-annihilation. Though its destructive potential is well documented, both in terms of scientific data and case studies, and the society and health organisations have been extremely concerned about its harrowing aftermath, substance abuse (drug addiction) continues to rise at an alarming rate. What is particularly unsettling is that it is the young who are the worst affected, and despite much publicity about the ill- effects of drug abuse, there seems to be no let- up in the rapidly rising graph of new addicts. Substance-addiction has, like in the West, led to the development of another social ill  crime. Sometime back a small group of drug addicts, THAT used to indulge in petty crimes to pay for their habit, tried to sabotage the whole power system of Haryana by removing fish plates and nuts and bolts from the 11,000 volts main tower line. In another incident, a drug addict of Mohali stabbed his sister- in- law when she refused to give him money for buying drugs. According to Dr Anil Malhotra, head of the drug de-addiction centre, PGI, Chandigarh, a drug abuser can engage in crimes of any dimension, ranging from brawls, rash driving and petty thefts to drug trafficking, without thinking of the consequences. Interestingly, the adult population of the city is more prone to liquor and tobacco abuse while the younger generation has found its nirvana in drugs. The drug menace is not confined to the poor and the uneducated sections of the young population which do not have the funds to buy expensive liquor. It has spread its tentacles to the affluent and the educated sections too. According to volunteers working against this menace, youngsters are more prone to medicinal drugs. Empty bottles of cough syrups can be found frequently in the lavatories and corners of schools and colleges of the City Beautiful. Chronic medicinal drug abusers also start injecting themselves with pain-killers and sedatives. The extent of drug addiction in the region is alarming. The number of patients in the drug de-addiction centre of the PGI, Chandigarh, is increasing every year. As many as 416 new patients have been brought to this centre this year as against 363 last year. Among them, 15 per cent are opium and heroin addicts, 4 per cent are habituated to cannabis, 26 per cent are intravenous injection users and 11 per cent have indulged in multiple drug abuse. About 44 per cent of the patients are suffering from alcohol abuse. The number of alcoholics has come down considerably since most of them are turning to substance abuse. As such, the number of patients taking intravenous drugs is rising at an alarming rate. The shift is because of the lower cost of narcotics. It would be pertinent to mention here that in 1988-89 only 3 per cent of the addicts were using intravenous drugs. However, it has now risen up to 26 per cent. On the other hand, 8 per cent of the patients admitted this year were found to be heroin addicts, down from 26 per cent in 1988-89. This is because of the high cost of heroin in the black market. One gram of heroin costs Rs 250 to 300 whereas an injection costs less than Rs 10. What is causing concern to doctors and volunteers is that a large number of patients do not seek treatment. They are wary of disclosing their identity and do not want to approach de-addiction centres of treatment. But, on the other hand, the telephone numbers of the counselling centre are inundated with calls asking for help and treatment via the telephone only. Though commendable work is being done by bodies like the Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotic Anonymous to help drug abusers, only the tip of the iceberg has been reached so far. A random survey in and around Chandigarh shows that the number of addicts is increasing by the day, and the efforts to curb the menace are niggardly. It is not only the boys who are falling prey to drug abuse. More and more girls are also getting attracted towards it. However, because of social reasons, parents hide the addiction more in the case of girls than boys. The drug de-addiction centre at the PGI received only three to four girls for treatment in the last five years. A study of some of the cases shows that those who served as peddlers ultimately got involved in the use of drugs. Initially, it was the hefty commission which lured them into supplying drugs to the addicts. The rate of commission for peddling is between 25 and 40 per cent of the street price. Addiction happens accidentally also, says Dr Malhotra. He recalls the case of a patient from Gurdaspur who went to his doctor for the treatment of some ailment and the doctor injected him with a pain-killer. The man felt a ""heavenly pleasure"" and soon became a drug abuser. The incidence of medicinal drugs abuse is more amongst students as most syrups have no smell, and after taking it one goes to sleep because of its sedative effect. Cough syrups used by abusers contain codeine phosphate, one of the derivatives of opiates. Every 5 ml of these syrups contains 10 mg of codeine phosphate. A 100 ml bottle of the syrup costs about Rs 26 only. Similarly, the salt buprenorphine is also a derivatives of opiates. However ,the salt disulfiram is an alcohol- sensitised drug. The beginners start with consuming a bottle everyday but they soon graduate to four or five bottles a day. There are no recent studies in the field of drug abuse. The studies conducted in the 70s and the 80s indicate that the drug abusers are mainly males, and an appreciable number of them are students . According to them, 10 per cent to 40 per cent of the population generally indulges in alcohol abuse. For other drug abuse, the percentage varies from 0.475 to 54 per cent. Furthermore, in students, the males outnumbered the females and the commonly abused substances included tobacco, alcohol, sedative  hypnotics of various kinds and amphetamines. The incidence ranged from 20 to 70 per cent. It is evident from these studies that besides the use of traditional substances, i.e. intoxicants originating from cannabis (bhang, charas, ganja etc ) and opium (afeem), in rural area, new drugs like heroin and benzodiazepines are being frequently abused by vulnerable groups, especially the non student youth, industrial workers and slum dwellers. Experts are of the view that the menace can be controlled effectively only through choking the supply. Effective policing against drug trafficking is, therefore, the answer. In Chandigarh, 16 cases of drug trafficking were registered in 1997. Eight cases have been registered in the current year. Besides, there were two major recoveries in 1997 which indicate the magnitude of abuse in the area. The police recovered more than 9 kg of smack in two different cases. In addition, large quantities of poppy husk, opium and charas were also recovered. According to DSP Subhash Chander Sagar and Inspector Jagbir Singh, who have been actively involved in anti-smuggling operations, a large number of students are indulging in the abuse of medicinal drugs. The police, they say, feels helpless because as per the Indian Drugs and Cosmetics Act selling of these drugs is a non-cognizable offence. However, certain drugs have been covered under the Essential Commodities Act. The law needs to be amended further to stop the use of medicinal drugs and the selling of the medicines containing prohibited salts should be made cognisable in the Drugs Act itself, Sagar said. Moreover, the stocks of chemists should be regularly monitored so that they cannot indulge in trafficking .",{},"['drug', 'drugs', 'heroin', 'head', 'cent', 'tribunesaturday', 'abuse', 'treatment', 'plus', 'addicts', 'medicinal', 'patients', 'number']","Wasted livesAddiction to medicinal drugs has reached alarming proportions in the region.

Featured story,,,8/11/2001 0:00,,"D ISCOVERED by American psychotherapist Roger and first practised by Gary Craig, the EFT functions on the Chinese concept of energy meridians. It believes that an ailment  physical or emotional  is essentially caused due to some disruption in the bodys energy system. Introduced in India by Rohini Chopra, who learnt the therapy during her three-week stay in the USAlast year, the EFTis being used by people to release their negative energy. Rohini, who has till date conducted about 15 workshops in Delhi and Chandigarh, says this American psychotherapeutic technique involves nothing except tapping on the ""12 identified ends of energy meridians in our body."" Rohini Chopra Rohini, who practises the EFT to heal others, remarks that a year ago she healed with the help of reiki and acupressure. She came to know about this technique when she had gone to the USA to help her daughter settle there. ""I had three weeks at my disposal. I just attended this workshop and realised how effective the technique was. And the best part of it is that after learning to heal yourself, you can start healing others. Each EFT workshop involves two sessions  in the first you learn to heal yourself; in the second you learn to heal others."" After getting back from the USA, Rohini went to call on her friend, who had been shot at by assailants. Recalls Rohini, ""The accident had left such a deep impact on my friend that she had virtually stopped venturing out alone. She was the first person I cured."" Then Rohini treated another friend, Premila Bharat, who had a chronic stomach ailment. Premila, who had accompanied Rohini on her Chandigarh visit, maintained that the EFT had changed her life for good. Premila, who is now herself a healer, has cured her brother-in-law, who was unable to move his legs due to a brain tumour. Mentioning the steps involved in the technique, Rohini says: ""The EFT works on the belief that all physical ailments have an emotional basis and vice-versa. I can prove this with an example. During the recent workshop in Chandigarh, a woman complained of a persisting pain in her feet. As I started tapping on her for pain in the feet, she began to tell me how much she hated her mother. I then began tapping for hatred for mother. She continued to list bitter memories of her childhood years. I kept treating her and she herself did not realise when her pain had vanished."" In Chandigarh, many have benefitted from the EFTworkshops. Ritu, a patient of multiple sclerosis, improved upon her walking and speech with the technique. Another resident, Poonam, was able to come out of her emotional crisis, and she is now using the technique to cure others. Stressing on the point that the EFTis a simple technique, Rohini avers: ""Negative energy gets released by tapping on the end points of energy meridians. The EFTdoes not claim to alter your external circumstances, but it arms you to change your attitude by accepting yourself as you are. The aim is to tell you that it is natural to experience negative feelings like anger, jealousy and enmity. You need not suppress them. Once this truth is accepted, the EFThelps you gain complete control over your energy system. It does not make you placid. It helps you respond peacefully, whatever the external circumstances."" EFT healers at you doorstep Chandigarh now has a group of EFT healers, who have been trained under Rohini Chopra to heal others. This group holds regular EFT workshops where anyone can come for a cure. Anita Bansal, the local coordinator for the EFT workshops, can be contacted on phone (775090) for counselling.

tribuneindia...Chandigarh Compendium,,,None,,"Planned city? THE general impression that Chandigarh is a planned city notwithstanding, there is little to corroborate any coordinated planning and execution of various schemes. For example, provision of road or storm water gullies. A quick survey by The Tribune reveals that in most of the cases, work on the provision of storm water gullies is taken up much after the work on a new road or strengthening of any existing road, intersection or roundabout is completed. This not only leads to additional expenditure but also creates traffic hazards, affecting the life of the road besides presenting eyesores. Take the case of the new traffic lights intersection of sectors 27 and 28 provided by the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation. The work on provision of storm water gullies was taken up much after the intersection had been opened to traffic. Even some of the patch work, necessitated by the plugging of a leaking joint, is still to be taken up though the road was dug up immediately after its commissioning a couple of months ago. The intersection is yet to be painted as per traffic regulatory requirements. Same is the story on Madhya Marg where slip roads have been recarpeted and some more slip roads provided. But work on provision of storm water gullies has started after recarpetting work is over. One wonders why all this cannot be coordinated. Honour Dr Birender Chopra, a lecturer in the department of biochemistry at the Sector 32 Government Medical College Hospital, has done her alma mater and the city proud. She has been chosen for the Young Scientist award, which will be conferred upon her at the 17th International Congress of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine to be held at Florence in Italy from June 6 to 11. Her research paper on some neurological disorders has also been accepted for presentation during the congress. The papers are based on the research she conducted at Christian Medical College and Hospital at Ludhiana. Dr Birender Chopra is a product of Carmel Convent School and MCM DAV College. Her father, Prof J.S. Chopra, was the founder Director-Principal of the Sector 32 Government Medical College Hospital while her father-in-law, Dr Ajmer Singh, had been the Director of Medical Education and Research, Punjab. Sustainable business The Environment Society of India (ESI) has released a book, ""Sustainable Business; Economic development and environmentally sound technologies"", published by the Regency Corporation Limited in association with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). This 273-page book deals with sound environmentally sustainable technologies for development. The United Nations General Assembly special session held in June, 1997, supported Agenda 21 adopted at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and urged the industries to adopt new technologies to meet the commitments made by the governments at the Kyoto conference on climate change. This book deals with the review of the existing technologies for the prevention and control of pollution, energy efficiency and cleaner production, identify the main forces behind the environmentally sound technologies, national and international legislation, financial incentives etc. It also examines the main issues of financing, technology transfer, assessment and information. The book is useful for all those who are engaged in development, transfer, and adoption of environmentally sound technologies. The book is available from ESI, Karuna Sadan Sector 11 B, Chandigarh. (Ph: 746832). Lathi raj The constables deputed in the traffic wing of the Panchkula police fit into the image of the lathi-wielding policemen. These ""lathi"" or ""stick"" wielding constables can be seen standing near the traffic lights at different points in the township. Nothing may be wrong in the policemen wielding lathis but what troubles the motorists is the dangerous fashion in which the lathis are used to signal the motorists, who jump the traffic lights or violate other traffic rules, to stop. In fact, recently two scooter-borne youths had to bear the brunt of the technique used by the policemen. In the process of stopping the youths, who were without helmets, a policeman hit the face of the one youth with his danda thereby injuring him badly. The victim had to get immediate medication to stop the bleeding. To check such incidents the local residents demand that the methods adopted by the traffic police should be changed that no physical injury is caused to the motorists. Fitness sake With the advent of summer, various parks of the city have started remaining crowded with health enthusiasts. People throng them not only for their morning and evening walks but also for regular exercises. Yoga classes are held at several places. Then there are those who exercise individually. The photographs on top of the page were clicked by our photographer, Manoj Mahajan, on a single day recently. Long & short of it When the Baby Doll, Alisha Chenai, made a grand entry into Chandigarh, it was not only the diminutively framed Indi-pop singer and her blonde look which got attention of her fans as well as scribes, but it was also her tall and attractive secretary who got more than just a few ""dekhos""! While the five-foot-nothing ""Indian-Madonna"" could hardly be seen, her towering secretary in tow was not only to be seen but also heard. With Alisha Chenai preferring to stick to a monosyllabic dialogue with the scribes, there was reason enough for the male scribes to go up to the attractive looking secretary and even chat her up. With Alisha maintaining a sphinx-like stance throughout her interaction with the media, even evading questions on her much-publicised ""tiff"" with Bollywood music director Anu Malik, the secretary was certainly the best bet to get some information from. And who minds a pretty looking news-source? Alcoholics Anonymous Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an organisation of men and women devoted to the noble cause of making alcoholics become sober. The only requirement for membership of AA is the desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for acquiring AA membership as it is self-supporting. A political and not allied with any sect, AAs primary purpose is to help alcoholics achieve sobriety. Founded by Bill W and Dr Bob S. in the thirties, AA has spread its wings over the globe. Millions have recovered, thanks to AA, while many more are on the road to recovery. There are more than 30,000 AA units in operation at present. In this region, AA meetings are held regularly at Delhi, Chandigarh, Panchkula, Mohali, Ropar, Nangal, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Dasuya, Sirsa and Sangrur where views are exchanged and strategies worked out to make the movement stronger. Thats news The reference section of The Tribune keeps clippings of various newsitems subjectwise. This is the practice followed in almost all other national dailies. But we were a little surprised to learn that a reader of The Tribune also maintains such clippings. For the past 25 years, Mr G.K. Chopra, of Sector 37-C in Chandigarh has been religiously cutting out off-beat items from The Tribune and pasting them in a scrapbook. The book of this Tribune reader, who is an Assistant Accounts Officer, is bulging with such items as ""Eight years in womb"", ""New tongue fixed"", ""Snake with two heads"" and ""Baby washed in washing machine"". Judicious literature The credit for this little write-up goes to Dr Subhash Rastogi, a man of letters, a resident of Chandigarh and ""an avid reader of Chandigarh Calling for years"". He has brought to Sentinel two outstanding books ""for notice"". These are ""Bride Burning: Social, Criminological and Legal Aspects"" in English and ""Ujala Darpan, Dhundhale Chehre"" in Hindi. The author is Mr Justice A.S. Garg of the Punjab and Haryana High Court with his residence at Chandigarh. Sentinel cannot attempt ""a notice"", meaning a review, in these columns. But a deep, hard look at the works convinces him of the morally inspired, legally sound and literarily rich contents of the books dedicated to humanitys total good. Their message is: it is always better to build than to break in life as in society. When man goes to his long home and mourners go about the street, one realises the quintessence of life which looks at immortality even while being bound in mortal coils. Words cannot be readily found for the appreciation of the learned jurist-writers love for the struggling being. But what remains unsaid says much subsequently in the field of the fine arts.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,1/30/2004 0:00,,"Chandigarh, January 29 With drug abuse in parts of rural Haryana emerging as a major public health problem and the fact that more and more teenagers are getting hooked to alcohol and tobacco, the PGIs Community Medicine Department has recommended the launch of community-based intervention, with special focus on schoolchildren. A study undertake by the department to assess the extent of drug abuse in two villages in Haryana, indicated that 48 per cent of the male population was consuming tobacco and as such there was an urgent need to launch control strategies with the active involvement of women and schoolchildren. About 28 per cent men were consuming alcohol, an equal number taking both alcohol and tobacco while 19 per cent were taking bhang and other drugs. The fact that 48 per cent male population was consuming tobacco(smoking and chewing) and 28 per cent alcohol, and many of them taking both highlights the need for launching a community-based intervention at the village level in order to overcome the limitations of hospital-based approach of de-addiction and training centre. Interestingly, 75 per cent of this population want to overcome their dependence on alcohol and drugs, with many of them hooked to both. Though drug abuse has been found mostly among the male population, but it is the women folk who face the brunt as it leads to quarrels, domestic violence, reducing family income, bad effect on children and lowering of the family prestige. A team of doctors and workers from the PGI, which has been running a comprehensive health service programme in the villages, organised a series of interactive sessions with villagers along with members from the Alcohol Anonymous group. The villagers were made to understand the ill-effects of alcohol, tobacco, bhang and in some cases drugs like nitrazepam and spasmoproxyvon on the human body and the kind of ailments that it could cause. The villagers discussed medical and other related problems being faced by them due to drug abuse which included cough, breathlessness, trembling, poor vision, weak heart, irritability, acidity, indigestion, weakness and reduced capacity to work. Those associated with the field study said one of the question they were frequently asked was the contradiction in the societal attitude towards alcohol consumption, which the villagers failed to understand. They felt when the government was itself promoting drinking by supplying it to the soldiers posted on the borders and high altitude areas, how could it talk of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. In India, alcohol and drug abuse has been a cause of concern for policy makers and majority of the drug de-addiction centres are located in the psychiatry wards of bigger hospitals in urban areas. The field workers found that the villagers were receptive to the remedial action suggested and realised that the drug abuse was having very adverse effect on their health and well being.",{},"['alcohol', 'drug', 'tribune', 'health', 'cent', 'abuse', 'tobacco', 'villagers', 'india', 'population', 'chandigarh', 'male', 'taking']","About 28 per cent men were consuming alcohol, an equal number taking both alcohol and tobacco while 19 per cent were taking bhang and other drugs.

The Sunday Tribune,,,9/22/2002 0:00,,"Lacking the discipline to focus on any one thing for long made it impossible for her to channel her energy into a job or business. Her husband had enough money and would not have discouraged her, had she been serious about pursuing a vocation. She remained on tenterhooks, easily excitable and convinced she was being used and abused by everyone. This feeling gnawed at her and led to severe mood swings. ""My husband is boring and predictable. Given a choice, he would choose his office over me. My parents couldnt be bothered. Had I their support, I would have walked out of this non-happening marriage ages ago. My in-laws are image conscious. They are condescending, as if forced to tolerate my buffooning ways. Our social crowd is vicious. Had a different set of people inhabited my world I would have been happy and motivated enough to actualise my potential."" What started off as acceptable social drinking threatened to become a habit. Downing two rum-cokes, vodka-orange juices or beer-limcas seemed harmless. Her husband did not mind, chivalrous young men offered to make her a drink and the bottomline was she enjoyed it. A drink made her feel lighter, she slept better and the world didnt seem such a bad place after all. Trouble started when the amount she drank at social dos seemed inadequate. Anita who had earlier hated forced socialising did not resent it so much now. It gave her a pretext to drink. She would steal a drink or two from her husbands bar before leaving, have a couple at the party and on returning home have some more. Her husband was not much of a drinker and he usually hit the bed on their return. Sleep eluded her and a few drinks helped. Anita was intelligent enough to know that her growing dependence on alcohol was not normal. However, she was not prepared to face this reality squarely. It was convenient to go on a binge, misbehave at times, embarrass the family and feel guilty the morning after. She always found enough reasons and excuses to justify the drinking, telling herself that she could stop the day she wanted to. Her husband and in-laws, by now, knew they had a problem on their hands but it was easier to deny it, treat it as an aberration and cover it up. They still had no idea of how much she was consuming. By now, she had to have a drink first thing in the morning, ""to collect myself and send the girls to school"". Since she was working, it was not difficult to buy her own liquor and stash it in a remote corner of her cupboard or shoe rack. In moments of acute need she hit her husbands bar. The situation deteriorated and her drinking acquired a major nuisance value. The family was up in arms realising there was little they could do to ""cover it up"", it was becoming difficult to hold on to her job and she knew she needed help. She had, by now, sunk low in her own estimation. She was aware of how her teenaged daughters were getting impacted by having to bear with a ""drunken mom"". The definitive moment came when her husband summoned her parents, apprised them of the situation and asked them to take charge of their daughter. Her father, a retired Army officer, had handled many crises but this numbed him. He knew sermonising would not help. She could not give up alcohol without medical, psychological and spiritual intervention. Doctors could flush it out, clean the system and put her on medication. They could treat her for damage that was still reversible. How would they deal with her emotional and mental state? A friend suggested Alcoholic Anonymous. But wasnt that something that existed only in America ? And even if it did have a chapter here, would his daughter be comfortable rubbing shoulders with fellow drunks ? The image he could conjure was that of truck drivers and good-for-nothing alcoholics. A meeting with the coordinator in a city close to his, changed that. He decided to take Anita to Delhi which had Asias only womens group. Anita allowed herself to be taken. She wanted to give up alcohol and knew she could not do it on her own. But the anxiety of facing a group and admitting she was an alcoholic was too much. By the time she stumbled into the little room housed in the backyard of the Masigarh Church (Sukhdev Vihar), she was in her own words ""sozzled"". The instant rapport was magical, in that it brought her back for the next meeting. When she walked in she said, "" I know I am a bad woman, a mad woman and an immoral woman."" To which they said, "" you are neither bad, mad nor immoral. You are just a sick woman. You have an illness and it can be cured."" This pronouncement was such a relief. To find people who had reached rock-bottom after drinking for 30-35 years and yet given it up provided her with a ray of hope. It was not easy to resolve and stay off alcohol but the support group and the affection, understanding and accountability that came from their frank discussions made it seem achievable. Gradually, she (like the others) found that God helps those who help themselves. There were occasional relapses but the group helped her tide over them. She knew that for an alcoholic like her there was no middle-of-the-road approach. She could never be a social drinker, content with having an occasional drink. If she drank it would be unstoppable, as if there was no tomorrow. There was no other way than to give it up entirely. She did that and today she voluntarily gives the group her time, talking to fresh entrants, telling them that if she could do it, they certainly can. She admits ""earlier I felt that everyone around me was wrong. Today they are the same. It is me who has changed and along with that change has come the awareness of life, beauty, god and love. I gave up alcohol not for others but for myself.""",{},"['alcohol', 'tribune', 'drinking', 'help', 'husband', 'group', 'anita', 'drink', 'woman', 'knew', 'social']","Had a different set of people inhabited my world I would have been happy and motivated enough to actualise my potential.""

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,9/18/2009 0:00,,"Chandigarh, September 17 A letter by the DSP (East) of the police to the Mayor, requesting that Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and former chairman of the market committee, be made available to the police in a case of fraud has sparked off a fresh row with the Congress terming it as an attempt to insult the Mayor. Soon after the Mayor received the letter, Congressmen led by the Mayor, Kamlesh, and party general secretary Shubash Chawla came in support of Babla and said the move was an attempt by the UT administrator to demolish the democratic structure in the city. They alleged that the administrator, SF Rodrigues, was out on a mission to target them and it was nothing but a conspiracy to target Congressmen and the police had become a puppet in the hands of the administrator. Showing the letter written by the DSP, Jasbir Singh Cheema, yesterday, they said they would also find out if a DSP rank officer was authorised to write such a letter to the first citizen of the city. In the letter the DSP said Babla was wanted in a cheating case for the allotment of sheds in the Sector 26 grain market and that he was absconding. They had obtained warrants for his arrest for October 16. Since Babla is an elected councillor and is evading arrest, you are requested to make him available to the police for joining investigation, he wrote in the letter. The Congress, which was silent on the issue earlier, came in support of Babla today. It stated that Babla was innocent and had been implicated in the case as he was playing an active role in opposing mega projects started by the administrator and had demanded a CBI probe in this regard. Chawla said apart from Babla, SDM (East) and Jhujjar Singh, a BJP leader, were on the committee that passed the agenda for the allotment of the sheds. It had been sent for further approval, but the authorities had only singled out Babla and initiated action against him. The Mayor said the police and the administration had degraded the MC and the post of Mayor by asking her to produce Babla. She said when Babla went to the police station and offered to join probe during his anticipatory bail, the police did not make him do so.

The High Court has also asked the administration to specify if there were any rules for ferrying students studying in urban and rural areas and whether the rules would be applicable to vehicles carrying students to institutes outside the city limits. Justice Bhalla asserted: The counsel for the UT states that the government schools under the control of the Chandigarh Administration are transporting children to and from schools with the help of independent contractors and are charging Rs 500 per child. The respondents are directed to file their affidavit and to inform the court whether any rules and regulations have been notified for transportation of schoolchildren and the students studying in the institutions in rural and urban areas. The Chandigarh Administration shall also consider whether its rules apply to the vehicles that transport students to schools and colleges situated outside the limits of Chandigarh, Justice Bhalla asserted. The case will now come up for further hearing on August 23. The directions came after Justice Rajive Bhalla heard amicus curiae Vaibhav Sharma and Munisha Gandhi, along with Haryana Additional AG DK Khanna, Punjab Additional AG Puneet Gupta, UT senior standing counsel Sanjay Kaushal and advocate Inderjit Kaushal for the UT Independent Schools Association. Justice Bhalla also questioned private schools in the city and the UT Administration about the mode and conditions of transportation provided to schoolchildren. The directions came after details of traffic violations made it evident that the school buses were still zipping away from the rules and regulations. The details produced before the court pertain to the challans issued by the Chandigarh Police for violations by school buses between January 1 and July 19, 2011. The total number of buses challaned during the period was 431, for as many as 684 violations. The total number of challans for drivers without proper uniform and nameplates were 285, while challan for attendants without proper uniform and nameplate were 96. As many as 292 challans were issued for miscellaneous offences. graft case DSP Ghirra files bail application Rajinder Nagarkoti Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 11 Mohali Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Raka Ghirra and her reader Manmohan Singh today filed a regular bail application before the special CBI court in a graft case. On July 24, the CBI had arrested Ghirra for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from a property dealer, KK Malhotra. Meanwhile in another matter, Ghirra filed another bail application in connection with an FIR registered against her by the UT Police under Excise Act. The court has issued notice to the UT Police to file a reply on the bail application. In her bail plea, DSP Ghirra, presently lodged in Burail Jail, has stated that she had filed income tax return from the year 2000 in which she had already mentioned about her jewellery, cash and property. Moreover the CBI failed to recover any illegal property document from her Sector-15 residence. The DSP had pleaded that she had cooperated with the investigating agency and it was after completion of her police remand that the CBI had demanded her judicial custody. She pleaded that as investigation would take more time and there is nothing to recover from her, the court should grant her a regular bail. Following a complaint by Mohali-based property dealer KK Malhotra, the CBI had laid a trap and had arrested Raka Ghirra from her residence. She was allegedly demanding money for favouring Malhotra in a case registered against him at Mohali. On July 24, the CBI had recovered ammunition from Ghirras house, included 1,237 cartridges, a revolver and a double-barrel gun made in West Germany. Besides, a total of 43 live cartridges of .32 bore, 22 empty cartridges of .32 bore, 14 S&W live cartridges (small), another 18 (.22 bore) live cartridges, a total of 114 .38 bore live cartridges, 76 AK-47 live cartridges, another 114 (7.62 SLR) live cartridges, two 7.72 sniper live cartridges, five carbine cal 30 live cartridges and 831 (12 bore) live cartridges.

Local court summons Inscol mgmt Rajinder Nagarkoti Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 11 A local court today issued summons to the director, the managing director, the medical superintendent and the resident medical officer of Inscol Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 34, in a case of medical negligence. Judicial Magistrate (First Class) SK Sharma issued summons to managing director Daljit Singh Gujral, director Nimrat Gujral, medical superintendent Dr Jayant Bannerji and resident medical officer Dr Paramjit Singh Mann on a complaint filed by Mani Majra resident Jagjit Singh Arora. The UT District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum had already awarded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the complainant in 2010 in the case. The forum had also directed the hospital to refund around Rs 8 lakh incurred as expenses on the treatment of the complainants wife in the hospital. The complainant stated that on August 1, 2005, his wife Inderjit Arora reported mild fever and pain in her left leg and visited Inscol Hospital. The doctor carried out some preliminary tests and asked the patient to go to another doctor for a check-up who advised immediate hospitalisation and also advised certain investigations. It was alleged that she was admitted to the ICU of the hospital where a few tests were carried out. However, none of the tests as advised by the doctors were carried out in order to ascertain that she was suffering from pulmonary embolism. HC directive to curb drunk driving Drivers may end up attending AA meetings Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Pinjore-Kalka snarl-ups Panchkula SP suggests alternative route In an attempt to prevent traffic chaos on the Pinjore-Kalka stretch, the Panchkula Superintendent of Police has suggested an alternative route. The SP states that a temporary diversion is available through the HMT, Pinjore, to NH 21-A, which will help ease traffic through Pinjore. The SP is requested to get in touch with the HMT, Pinjore, and place a proposal before them in this respect. This request should be considered in the right spirit, particularly as this will help, to some extent, in decongesting the national highway, the court held. Chandigarh, August 11 Mixing drinks with driving may see you wind up in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. You may even lose your licence. For, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made clear its intentions of applying brakes to the menace of drunk driving by directing the magistrates to ask sozzled drivers to attend a fixed number of meetings at the AA. Driving home the message against drunk driving, Justice Rajive Bhalla has asserted: A person driving under the influence of liquor endangers his life, as also the life of others, and, therefore, must be dealt with without any misplaced sense of equity or indulgence. The magistrates may, while exercising their discretion in matters of sentence, consider releasing offenders on strict probation and refer them to organisations like Alcoholics Anonymous for attending a fixed number of meetings. A magistrate may also pass orders for the suspension of the drivers licence. Justice Bhalla also directed the removal of all encroachments on the land beneath the Zirakpur flyover. Counsel for the National Highways Authority of India states that the concessionaire has identified two agencies to beautify the area under the flyover. The matter shall be forwarded to the ministry concerned for necessary approval. The approvals be obtained preferably within fortnight, as land beneath the flyover is being gradually encroached upon by street vendors, Justice Bhalla added. The hearing also brought to fore the State of Punjabs stand against allowing new building to face the highways. The State of Punjab has no objection if the buildings to be constructed on the land abutting the highways face away from the highways. As buildings that abut the state and national highways, particularly factories, malls, hotels, motels, colonies, group housing societies, banquet halls, etc. are granted licences by GMADA or PUDA, it will be appropriate to seek their response with respect to the decision taken by the Chief Secretary, Justice Bhalla asserted. Referring to an affidavit, Justice Bhalla said the work on setting up a bus stop at Zirakpur was likely to be completed by May, 2012 after commencing in September. Asking the State of Punjab and other respondents to file an affidavit as to how they propose to regulate the buses halting in Zirakpur till the bus stop is functional, Justice Bhalla directed the authorities concerned to ensure that this bus stop does not lead to the parking of rickshaws, auto-rickshaws, buses and private vehicles. Justice Bhalla directed: Parking shall be provided within the precincts of the bus stop. Reprieve for Fortis HC stays orders bringing hospital within RTI ambit Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 11 Acting on a petition filed by Fortis Healthcare (India) Limited, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today stayed the operation of an order passed by the State Information Commission bringing the hospital within the ambit of the Right to Information Act. The commission had held the hospital was a public authority within the meaning of Section 2 (h) of the RTI Act. It had also directed the hospital to appoint a public information officer. The hospital asserted that the provisions of the RTI Act were not applicable to it; and the commission erroneously held that the petitioner was substantially funded by the state authorities as it was allotted land allegedly at concessional rates. The petitioner contended that the commission had, rather, wrongly held that since the land was allotted to Fortis for the setting up of a super-speciality hospital in Sector 62, Mohali, at concessional rate, it was a public authority. The counsel said the order was contrary to the records in as much as the petitioner is not funded by state, whether substantially or otherwise, and purchased the land at the then prevailing market rate. He insisted that the hospital was not covered by the definition of public authority. The counsel said: The intention of Parliament by using the term public authority was to exclude entities/limited companies that are not funded by the government from the scope and ambit of the RTI Act. Fortis added that the order passed by the commission on May 12 was arbitrary, unconstitutional, without jurisdiction. It was also against the legislative intent; and was liable to be set aside as it completely ignored the fact that Fortis Healthcare was a public-listed company incorporated under the Companies Act. Seeking directions for setting aside the impugned orders, Fortis further added that the hospital was not an authority, institution or self-government established or constituted by or under the Constitution or by any other law made by Parliament or by any other law made by the state legislature. The matter had reached the commission after Vice-Chancellor of MM University, Mullanna, had sought information under the RTI Act on surgery undergone by his daughter Dhanashree Damle. After the hospital declined the information, the complainant moved the commission.

It was on her fathers complaint that the Panchkula Police had lodged a missing persons complaint at the Sector 15 police post in Panchkula. But after recovering her body, the cops had converted missing complaint in the murder case and registered against her ex-husband Karan Mehra and her close friend, Tanmay under Sections 302 (murder), 364 (kidnapping) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the IPC. But during investigations, the cops had given clean chit to ex-husband Karan Mehra.

Stating that the SGPC member had no role to play in the committees working, which was a representative body of non-SGPC religious institutions in the township, the President of the committee, Mr Joginder Singh Sondhi, added that the committee would not tolerate any interference of the SGPC member. Declaring his allegiance to the SAD by holding a press conference at Phase XI Singh Sabha Gurdwara in the presence of party members Amrik Singh Mohali and Paramjit Singh Kahlon, Mr Sondhi today managed to shift the focus of the committee from religious issues to political ones. Mr Sondhi, the former president of the committee, claims that was unanimously elected President on May 28 following which today he selected his team in accordance with the committees constitution. Alleging that the SGPC member wanted to have his own members in the committee so that he could control it from outside, Mr Mohali said Hardeep Singh wanted Mr Tirlochan Singh Loch as the general secretary of the committee which was not acceptable to other members. Terming the whole affair as an attempt to divide the Sikh community on political lines, Mr Hardeep Singh said the election of Mr Sondhi as the president itself was illegal. According to the constitution of the committee, the local SGPC member is given the duty of conducting elections to the post of the president of the committee. In that capacity I have not issued any letter to Mr Sondhi stating that he is the President. Joginder Singh Sondhi proposed the name of Tirlochan Singh Loch as President and Sohan Singh Soods name was proposed by someone else. Mr Sondhis name for the post the president was never even proposed, he added. However, members of Mr Sondhis group pointed out that since no final decision could be taken between Mr Sood and Mr Loch it was decided to elect Mr Sondhi as president. Mr Sondhi was given the siropa by Mr Hardeep Singh before the Guru Granth Sahib in a large gathering. Why were objections not raised by him then about the presidentship? questioned a member of the Sondhi group. Mr Hardeep Singh said more than 20 members of the various institutions represented by the committee had handed over a written complaint to him alleging religious misconduct of on part of Mr Sood and Mr Sondhi. They had demanded that elections to the post of president be held again. I had constituted a fact finding committee to look into the allegations and also directed Mr Sondhi not to take any step till the committees reports are received.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/17/2008 0:00,,"COMMUNITY SMEs leave women at cab drivers mercy Yet to provide security to women during night shifts Ruchika M. Khanna Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 16 The spread of IT and ITEs sector in the tricity has drawn up new challenges for the administration. As more and more women are now going out to work in the BPOs (business process outsourcing) and call centres that now dot the region, their security has become prime concern. The recent incident in Pune, where a woman employee of a call centre was raped, has once again raised this vital issue. Excluding big BPOs and IT companies here, most of the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the IT sector have failed to address this concern, even as almost 50 per cent of their employees happen to be women. These SMEs have made provision for dropping and picking up their employees, who work on the night shifts, but the antecedents of the cab drivers are rarely checked. Refana, an employee of Infosys, says that the security of employees is of prime concern for big IT companies like Infosys. If we get late in the office, its cab drops us. Besides a driver, a guard is also sent in the cab for our safety, she adds. In fact, most of the big IT companies follow certain security guidelines which lists out how the antecedents of the drivers are to be checked, and how the guards are to be sent out in the cabs during night hours. Security is something no one will compromise on. Most of the companies share these security guidelines. Any lapse in security will not only bring a bad name to the company, but also hamper its future recruitment process, says a senior human resource official in Dell. Unfortunately, the same is not true for the SMEs here. The information gathered by the Chandigarh Tribune reveals that most of these companies have entered into contract with car rental companies, who provide vehicles for ferrying staff to different location. These cab owners have in turn hired drivers on contract basis, says Anupama Sharma, who recently quit her job in a Mani Majra-based BPO. Women are generally apprehensive if they are the first ones to be picked up, or the last ones to be dropped after a night shift. They are left at the mercy of these drivers. Parents of two of my colleagues would keep track of their daughters while they were in the office cabs, by speaking to them on the mobile till the time they had not reached the office or the home safely. The fact that the night patrolling in the satellite towns of Panchkula and Mohali, and in the southern sectors of the city is quite bad also enhances the risk factor for women employees. Says an employee with a Mohali- based call centre, One night as I was being driven home to Sector-49, a few youths in a car started following us. Since there was no PCR en route, it made us very nervous. It was only because of the swiftness of the driver that we were able to dodge them. Though the Pune incident has now created awareness about the safety concern of employees and the senior administration officials are asking IT companies to pull up its socks, it remains to be seen how far these security concerns are addressed.",{},"['drivers', 'tribune', 'smes', 'employees', 'india', 'companies', 'women', 'cab', 'concern', 'office', 'security', 'chandigarh', 'night']","COMMUNITY SMEs leave women at cab drivers mercyYet to provide security to women during night shiftsRuchika M.

Sources in the traffic police said the luxary Hyundai Elantra car (PB-26-D-0005), driven by Bunny Dullo was stopped at a naka near the Housing Board Chowk as it had black film on its window panes. During inspection of documents, Bunny Dullo failed to produce a driving license. At this, the traffic police booked him for both violations. Bunny Dullo was also accompanied by gunmen, said a senior police officer. Need to build bridges of communications between industry, institutes Tribune News Service Panchkula, February 19 In a fast-changing world where technologies become obsolete overnight, the two-day National Workshop on Industry Institute Interaction (NWIII-2007), today, focussed on the need to build bridges of communication between the industry and technical institutes churning out skilled work force. Academics and industrialists were unanimous about the fact that the present curriculum being followed in ITIs needs to be changed in consonance with the needs of the industry. Further, the speakers held the view that it needs translation into skill formation rather than confining itself to imparting theoretical knowledge. The Haryana Education Minister, Mr Phool Chand Mullana, in his inaugural address at the workshop organised by National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, said that Haryana Government was committed to excellence in technical education quality. ""The budget for technical education has been increased to Rs 90 crore in 2006-07 compared to Rs 50 crores in 2005-06. The World Bank also deserved kudos for its Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), initiated to strengthen the technical education system,"" he stated. Mr C.B.Mathur, Chairman, Board of Governors, NIT Kurukshetra, presided over the inaugural session. He assured that NIT Kurukshetra would be ever ready to take the lead in promoting the ties between industry and institute and would act as a nodal centre for collaboration with the industries. Dr M.N. Bandyopadhyay, Director, NIT, Kurukshetra, emphasised on the need for more memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between industries and institutes. Dr R.P.Hooda, Vice- Chancellor, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, said the scale of operation of industries had increased immensely. ""Even small-scale units have grown into huge establishments. Its really time for us to go beyond the designing of courses. We must ensure that these get translated into action and contribute to the skill of the student,"" he stated. The Chairman of CII, Mr Adesh Gupta, said implementation was the most important part of any project. ""Institutes must learn to implement what is planned for them. We have a successful IIT model which must be adopted for quality,"" he said. Coming down heavily on the present status of summer trainings for passouts from technical institutes, Mr Gupta said interns hardly did anything. ""They copy old reports and present them to the faculty, get graded on those and get a certificate. This should be checked since it is in nobodys interest,"" Mr Gupta maintained. He stated that the dormant interaction cells in technical institutes needed to be activated and suggested that stating a course in solar energy management would be a good idea to meet the challenge presented by shrinking sources of energy. Holding that the interaction aims to bring out a road map showing steps to be taken by these two sectors to improve the interaction among themselves, specific time base activities, the speakers added that the industry and the institutions would both gain from the deliberations. The Vice-Chancellor of Guru Jambeshwar University, Dr RP Bajpai, speaking about the mismatch between the job and the training provided, said the responsibility of bridging the gap had to be shared equally by the institutions that provided the training and the industry that provided the jobs. While on the one hand the industry had a stellar role to play by providing inputs on curriculum design, infrastructure development, faculty training among others, on the other, the institutions needed to remain in constant touch with the industry through consultancy and research in an increasingly competitive global market, he added. Workhorses of yore to fly past during IAF fleet review Vijay Mohan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 19 For IAF veterans it would be a nostalgic moment when the Air Forces workhorses of yore, Canberra bombers and Avro transport aircraft stage a fly past during the Presidential Fleet Review (PFR), scheduled to be held here on March 7. It is after a very long time that these aircraft would be participating in a fly-past, a senior officer at the Air Force Station here remarked. The IAF latest acquisition, the Embraer jet for VVIP transport, may also feature in the fly-past, thought its inclusion is not yet finalised, sources added. Almost all aircraft and weapon systems in the IAFs inventory would feature in the PFR Once the mainstay of the IAFs bomber fleet, only a few Canberras now remain in service. Inducted in 1957, these were used extensively for bombing and interdiction missions during the Indo-Pak wars. With about 58 years of service, perhaps the longest ever for a combat aircraft, these are now used for strategic reconnaissance. Having bought over a 100 Canberras of different variants from the United Kingdom, the IAF became the largest user of this aircraft apart from the Royal Air Force. It also formed part of the Indian peace keeping force deployed in Congo under a United Nations mandate. The British HS-748 Avro, which made its appearance in the Indian skies in 1964, was the workhorse of the IAF transport fleet before the arrival of the Russian AN-12 and thereafter, the AN-32. About 30 Avros are reported to be in service and are mainly used for training, communication and VVIP transport. Some of these aircraft are being further modified and upgraded. Sources said about 20 aircraft formations, including those of fighters, transport and helicopters, would be participating in the fly-past. Fighter formations would comprise five aircraft each, mostly in arrow-head formation, while the composition of transport and helicopter formations would vary. The most noticeable formation would be combat aircraft forming the figure of 75 to mark the IAFs Platinum Jubilee. Several formations today carried out dry runs over the Chandigarh air base to try out various flight paths for the fly-past. The purpose was to select the flight path which would give maximum visibility to ground audience. This would be the IAFs fourth PFR. The first two were held at Palam in April, 1954 and April, 1972. The third was held at Chandigarh on January 19, 1976, which was reviewed by the then President, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. This included a fly-past by 43 fighters comprising 23 MiG-21s and 20 Su-7s. The parade consisted of 823 officers and airmen along with a line-up of Mi-8, Aloutte and Cheetah, along with An-12, Gnat, Fairchild, Packet, Canberra, Hunter, Su-7 and MiG 21 aircraft. Seminar on emerging world order Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 19 The Army is hosting an international seminar on Emerging World Order: Implications for the Security Calculus of the Extended South Asian Region on February 22 and 23 at New Delhi. The seminar is being organised by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies (CLAWS), a Delhi-based think tank and a large number of eminent security analysts, from India and abroad are participating in the seminar, an official statement said. Participants from Australia, China, Japan, Sri Lanka and Turkey would be presenting papers. The seminar is being inaugurated by the President, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. The guests of honour for the inaugural session would be the Defence Minister, Mr A.K. Antony, Panchayati Raj, Youth Affairs and Sports Minister, Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar, and Chief of the Army Staff, Gen J.J. Singh. A large number of delegates, comprising serving and retired civil and military officers, ex-chiefs, security analysts, ambassadors, high commissioners, defence attaches, academics from a host of countries, including France, Germany, Russia, China, Japan, Brazil, Chile, the USA and the United Kingdom be attending the seminar. A water-logged road Tribune News Service Panchkula, February 19 Residents of Sector 19 here today protested against the municipal council for the poorly maintained road which goes towards Bartana. With water-logging a constant problem in the area, the road is flooded with water, making it impossible for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists to pass. A resident of the sector, Mr Dev Raj, said they had complained about the pot holes on the roads and a leaking pipe, which had made their life miserable, to the authorities concerned. We have complained to the officials of the Haryana Urban Development Authority, municipal council and everybody we could possibly approach, but to no avail, he said. A fortnight later the problem continues as they await action from the authorities. The residents have also approached the Deputy Commissioner, Ms Neerja Shekhar, to intervene in the matter and redress their grievance.",{},"['industry', 'tribune', 'service', 'india', 'aircraft', 'institutes', 'technical', 'iaf', 'transport', 'chandigarh', 'kurukshetra', 'mr']","Traffic cops book Dullos sonTribune News Service Chandigarh, February 19Bunny Dullo, Son of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) President, Mr Shamsher Singh Dullo, was today booked by the Chandigarh Traffic Police for violating traffic rules.

The Sunday Tribune,,,2/10/2013 0:00,,"This fix can ruin your life Gamblers Anonymous comes to the aid of individuals addicted to betting. They land in a spot, as their careers and family lives are hit Taru Bahl F or Kartik, harmless gambling started with stakes of Rs1000 which quickly graduated to those ten times higher and before he knew, in one cricket season he lost as much as Rs4 lakh. A fresh graduate, into his first job, he scraped through and paid bookies and money lenders by borrowing from friends. By the time the next set of tournaments began, he was deep into the betting cycle  desperately chasing losses. Within a year, he was a sports junkie, betting on any game beamed on the telly. Three years down the line, he lost Rs 30 lakh, along with the confidence of family and friends. A nervous wreck, he vacillated from feelings of denial, desperation, anger, acceptance and is now finally into rehab. Coming from a wealthy family, it was easy for him to get a chance to fix his life. Not all are as lucky. Twentyone-year-old Anirudh found it exciting as he watched his parents play flash on Diwali eve. When friends asked him to join them for poker, he did it for a lark. In one evening he won Rs10,000. Then began a series of poker nights. When losses mounted, at the behest of friends, he tried his hand at cricket gambling and before he knew it, was deep into the world of bookies, money lenders and people who stood as guarantors. He lost close to Rs 20 lakh, mortgaging his laptop, cameras, iphone, play station and even selling his mothers gold bangles. His grades dropped, friends circle shrunk and his only companions were his mobile phone, a few sim cards, television in his room and a bunch of people he spoke to desperately late into the night to juggle borrowings that allowed him to be ""active"" to sustain the betting habit. When T-20 and World Cup series, the most sought after cricket matches, were not on, he was glued to the telly to watch and bet on any match. Now he is a regular with the weekly Gambling Anonymous meetings which have helped him stay clean for 100 days. Surge in betting Gambling in India is restricted. Despite this, an estimated 40 per cent internet users visit gambling sites primarily for lottery, cricket and horse betting. The Public Gambling Act of 1867 prohibits running or being in charge of a public gaming house. The penalty for breaking the law is a fine of Rs 200 or imprisonment of up to three months. But this has not kept budding and seasoned gamblers at bay. ""In fact, numbers have spiralled and young upwardly mobile boys and even girls and housewives are taking to betting via the internet. The ease with which it can be done has put many gamblers in a spot, affecting their careers, family lives and most importantly, their state of mind,"" says a Mumbai-based stock market agent- turned-bookie who started by placing bets himself and seeing how lucrative it is, took to it full time. Daily, he witnesses young people lying, stealing and indulging in criminal activity to support the habit but he is not here to play moral guardian and is only interested in getting what is owed to him. The surge in online gambling can be seen in a report by Media and Entertainment Consulting Network (MECN) that estimates the entire Indian gambling industry to be worth $60 billion, back in 2009. With greater internet penetration, this has only grown manifold. ""Gambling has been around, from the days of the Mahabharata with Yudhishthir putting his wife, Drapuadi at stake to countless men losing family fortunes over lottery, cards and races. Today it is more prevalent because it is easily accessible. All it takes is a call or click of a mouse to place a bet,"" says Kaveri, a caregiver. First it was her husband who was an alcoholic and now it is her son who in the last 18 years has lost all the family property. She stresses the need for a support group for caregivers who can share and learn ways of coping with a complex condition. Not only does the addict need help but also the caregiver who battles intense feelings of inadequacy as well as anger, frustration and confusion. The addict remains oblivious to the paranoia he creates with his lying and manipulative, deceitful behaviour. She goes regularly for Codependents Anonymous (CODA) meetings in Delhi and feels they saved her from going mad. ""It helped me deal with my addict son in a more clinical and constructive manner. I finally understood that I need to be okay first before I can deal with him."" Self esteem issues According to an alumni of DAIRRC run by Yusuf Merchant in Mumbai, ""Most addicts are low on self esteem. A common thread runs through each of them, whether they are addicted to sports betting, cards and horses or sex, shopping or mobile texting. The programme I did was for more than a year, where recovery and healing were so extensive that when I stepped into the real world, I could be surrounded by temptation and yet hold my ground and say ""no"" to drugs. I understood that for me, unlike my friends, dabbling in it just once would make me plummet to depths of the very hopelessness I had just emerged from."" He emphasises that the addict needs to be pulled out of his current environment and put in a place where there are people who understand and work with him to overcome his compulsive disorder, which if left unaddressed consumes him and all those around him. He says that post the programme, his relationships with his siblings, parents and girlfriend improved. More than others, he was surprised to see that the treatment took out the liar and manipulator in him, leaving behind a regular person with aspirations to do something constructive with his life. ""All through the addiction I was seen as a certain kind of person which I now realised was not me, but my addictive behaviour. For the first time in many years, I acquainted myself with who I was and what I wanted to be,"" he adds. Gamblers Anonymous is still in its fledgling stage and it takes courage for addicts to overcome the fear of stigma and social disapproval to seek help Photos by Aamit Khanna While there is no dedicated rehab for gambling in India, there are places where people with addictive behaviours are counselled. Dr Ashwini Kumar who runs Santulan in Delhi, says, ""Gambling is like any other addiction which is afflicted with all the ds - dealth of a loved one, debt and divorce. In the acute addictive phase, it is manifested through events like losing a job, having a run-in with crime, theft, extortion and even suicide."" He explains that the period of recovery first entails admitting helplessness or powerlessness before seeking help and protection from an external source. He says there are no instant or permanent cures. Rather, ""battling addiction is a lifelong struggle and condition that has to be managed. The recovering addict has to be constantly aware of his vulnerability to succumb to temptation and put in place safeguards that include changing company, not watching television, saying no to card parties etc and for caregivers too to be watchful at all times."" In other words, it is a bio-psychosocial disease, just like blood pressure or hypertension. The persons lifestyle and even career needs to therefore fit into the disease not the other way round. According to the Delhi Gambling Anonymous group, which began having meetings a year ago, ""while Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings are well attended, Gambling Anonymous is still in its fledgling stage. Stigma, fear of being exposed and denial come in the way of people stepping out and admitting they have a problem and need help."" SBK Singh, Joint Commissioner, Crime, New Delhi, points out that gambling per se is not an offence, but if in a public place it is. Also, with the coming of the Justice Juvenile Act, one cannot arrest those less than 18 years of age. The solution lies within society and family.

"Legalise drugs, get rid of addiction","TWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline  “81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010”.",Rajendra P Jindal,2017-08-07T00:19:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"Rajendra P JindalTWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline  “81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010”. The other news item appeared the very next day, and was titled ""Punjab Inspector held for drug trafficking"" The same evening, it was prominently splashed on all television channels. It continued to be followed in the media for the next couple of days until it was drowned by similar news.An ordinary reader may be excused for not seeing any relation between these two. But let us take them one by one. It may be news to most readers that tobacco (nicotine) is a drug too, albeit a legal one, in all the senses of the word that “drug” conveys. Until a few years ago, rich and powerful tobacco companies in the US, most of the medical researchers and doctors (the latter too on the payroll of tobacco companies) refused to admit that tobacco is a drug. It was contended that it is, at worst, a habit-forming substance only. With the help of PET and MRI scans, it has been conclusively proved that nicotine creates the same biochemical and molecular effects in the brain as any other drug such as cocaine and heroin and many other activities such as a kiss, a hug or a word of praise. This effect is known as elevation of a neurotransmitter substance (a chemical which carries messages from one micro part of the brain to the other) called “Dopamine”. The surge in the level of Dopamine produces a feeling of pleasure, at least initially. This effect is not common to the same degree in everybody; probably it is modified by a genetic factor. Therefore, whereas some people can ""take it and leave it"", others become addicted. Smoking or chewing tobacco is as addictive as any other drug and as difficult to get rid of. It gives the same sense of pleasure and the physical ill-effects are much more than any other drug. No other drug causes fatal cancers, heart and chest problems and many serious ailments.The interesting question that arises is: how were 81 lakh people able to give it up without even a single one ever being arrested or put into jail? No amount of tobacco was confiscated and no police officer or politician was ever accused of dealing with tobacco. One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited. Secondly, it is the education by various means and at various fora about the ill-effects of tobacco that has worked the miracle. In school and college textbooks, on radio and television as well as cigarette advertisement boards and even cigarette packets, ill-effects of smoking are prominently displayed. Most people seem to know that smoking causes the cancer of the lungs, even if they know nothing else. Therefore, compared to many more than those who have given up smoking are those who want to and are trying to give up smoking.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });As far as the other news that a Punjab Police Sub-inspector was held for drug trafficking, nobody should have trouble believing that the episode is only the tip of the iceberg. A junior police officer cannot run a drug empire without the collusion of  colleagues and seniors. In the run-up to the Punjab Assembly elections, the chiefs of at least two of the political parties declared that they will totally abolish the drug menace from Punjab within a month of coming to power. The one who is now the Chief Minister, sotto voce, scaled the peak of rhetoric and ignorance when he declared that “the back of the drug trade has been broken”. As the subsequent events, including the news in discussion have revealed, the demon called drug trade is healthy and well, thank you. Are these leaders innocent, ignorant, naive or plain simpletons? The drug trade will persist as long as our approach to handling it remains archaic.For some unknown reason, in contrast to smoking and consumption of alcohol, consuming drugs has always been considered a character flaw, a criminal activity. The dopamine hypothesis has proved that drug addiction is a disorder of the brain no different from that caused by nicotine and alcohol. It is a mental illness of similar nature. The right place for a drug addict, therefore, is a hospital and not a prison and the way to deal with drugs is not to prohibit them but to legalise them just as it is in the case of tobacco and alcohol. Why are we so keen and insistent on prohibiting drugs and not tobacco and alcohol, while the latter two are more harmful? It obviously cannot be because we are a nation with knee-jerk puritanism. In that case, we would prohibit alcohol also. There are two reasons for the insistence on drug prohibition. The drug trade will exist as long as there is prohibition that generates exorbitant profits for the drug lords like our Sub-inspector and his seniors as well as politicians. Also, we inherently want to punish narco-trafficking, not eradicate it. However, the most novel reason for drug prohibition so far has been propounded by the American author Barbara Ehrenreich. She feels that we cling to prohibition for the same reason one clings to so many other self -destructive habits like nicotine, cocaine and heroin: because of the way it makes us feel — good and self righteous. If we surrender now, it will send the wrong message. Says she, “Legal drugs, even if heavily taxed and extensively regulated would no doubt be cheaper than illegal ones. This could mean more people sampling them out of curiosity. This danger has to be weighed against the insidious marketing dynamics of illegal drugs whose widely inflated prices compel the user to become a pusher and a recruiter of new users”. It is time to try a new approach to the drug problem. The people who want to use drugs know where to get them and no law has yet dissuaded people from using them. Legalise, regulate and tax drugs to the hilt. Take the money that would have gone towards preventive laws and spend it on education, healthcare and rehabilitation. A word about rehabilitation too. Dopamine-related research has shown that abstinence, if maintained, not only halts the physical and psychological damage wrought by drugs but also reverses it in large measure. A majority of the rehabilitation centres, mushrooming all over and uniformly lacking sufficient staff with enough expertise (psychiatrists and psychotherapists) and dedication (nurses and helpers), are worse than prisons. An addict needs long treatment, perhaps running into months. During this period, there are failures but their rate is no different from that for other chronic diseases. Nearly half the recovering addicts fail to maintain complete abstinence after a year, about the same proportion of patients with diabetes and hypertension who fail to comply with their medication regimens. Therefore, occasional relapse only means that more treatment is required, not that the addict be imprisoned. Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotic Anonymous are the two organisations which probably have the highest cure rate because their members never refer to themselves as “cured”; they always call themselves “recovering addicts”. We could begin with a drug like marijuana and see how abolishing prohibition works. Then, we could move on to more drugs. Doesn't it sound like an idea that might catch on?The writer is a surgeon at the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot",{},"['addiction', 'drug', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'trade', 'tobacco', 'smoking', 'rid', 'punjab', 'nicotine', 'legalise', 'reason', 'prohibition']","One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited.

A case in point is the faulty design of the LIG flats in Sector 44-C. While the board has provided garages to the first floor and second floor and corner ground floor allottees, the other ground floor allottees are not that lucky. This is a strange sort of discrimination and causes a lot of heartburning and inconvenience to the ground floor allottees, alleges Mr Jagat Mohan Aggarwal, a resident of the sector. The CHB may not rectify all shortcomings in the designs but surely it must provide uniform facilities to the allottees of one particular category, he adds. Posted out The Commandant of the locally based Transport Battalion of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, Mr A S Chinna, has been posted to the force headquarters at New Delhi. Mr Chinna, who commanded the battalion for over two years, has now been appointed Commandant Staff (Administration). During his tenure here, he was responsible for commissioning a workshop to fabricate bodies of buses and trucks inducted into the ITBP. Meanwhile, the battalions second-in-command, Mr S.S. Harta, has been appointed the officiating commandant, till the time a new commandant is posted here. The battalion is responsible for meeting all transport requirements of the force as well as maintenance and overhaul of vehicles. Road to nowhere To believe the board or ones eyes  this was our dilemma when we came across this board (see picture) near St Kabir School in Sector 26.While the board proclaimed that the route No 3 to Panchkula had been completed over a month ago, in reality the road is far from being complete. Only a part of the road has been completed and it would be quite sometime before it would be fit for use. To avoid confusion the department concerned should either remove the misguiding board or complete the construction work for the sake of credibility. Headless Believe it or not, three of the four Congress organisations have been headless for quite some time. These organisations are the Sewa Dal, Mahila Congress and Youth Congress. Informed sources say the Sewa Dal and the NSUI have been without Presidents. These posts have not been filled for the past one year. The President of the Chandigarh Youth Congress was, however, removed following his appointment as General Secretary of the Chandigarh Territorial Congress, as announced by Mr Pankaj Sharma, observer appointed by the Indian Youth Congress for the membership drive. Insiders say that the Municipal Corporation elections will take place very shortly. Senior leaders feel that the party might suffer in the elections because of the failure of the Congress High Commands to fill these posts. Telecom blues The telecom department blues are not meant for ordinary residents alone. Sometimes, even highly placed officials also have to bear the brunt of faults in the system. These days, it has become a little difficult to get in touch with the UT Home Secretary at his residence phone number. The telephone directory of the UT Administration mentions the residence phone number of Mr R.S. Gujral as 741095. But this number is not-functional. So when you dial, a charming voice on the other side says: Service to the dialled number has been temporarily withdrawn. Given the state of affairs, anyone who wishes to contact Mr Gujral at home must take the trouble of calling up at his UT Secretariat office and taking his actual number from the office people. Khula darbar Frequent khula darbars organised by the Panchkula district administration to redress the grievances of the public appears to have failed as the same complaints continue to pour in repeatedly . Hundreds of civil and criminal complaints throughout the state, which are taken up by the authorities were brought to the notice of the Deputy Commissioner repeatedly but were referred to the authorities of departments concerned for necessary action. However, the administration time and again claims that a total of such complaints, including such of A department were taken up and the rest of B were solved on the spot. Complainants start assembling from far away places early in the morning and some times the complainants have to wait for long hours due to the inadequate arrangements made by the authorities for the massive gathering. In public viewpoint these Khula Darbars have turned into the eye-wash centres for them. A wet experience Nowadays walking in the verandahs outside the decked up shops in the famous Sector 17 piazza can be a wet experience. Not that the roofs of the verandahs leak or the rain troubles you. Instead, water keeps on falling in droplets on ones head due to the airconditioners. These ACs  all of them split type  have been set up by shopkeepers in unique places. These may be 15 feet high just above the signboard of the shop. Iron frames are used to hold up the body of the AC. The cold air is carried from the AC to the inside of the shop through special pipes. The water generated by the ACs in this humidity keeps on dripping in the verandahs and on the head and clothes of the customers. ID gift It is a gift the UHBVN plans to give to its residents on Independence Day. The gift is a portable transformer to attend to any breakdowns which crop up at unearthly hours, putting not only the residents to a lot of inconvenience but also the employees who attend to the complaints. The department officials are very enthusiastic about the new acquisition, the first of its kind in the city. It can supply electricity for four to six hours without interruption. This will help us buy time to attend to the fault without the phone constantly ringing and residents breathing down our necks, an official said. The residents, too, have heaved a sigh of relief with the new arrangement scheduled to take off in a weeks time. And yet the question remains: is a single transformer enough to cater to a city with its ever-increasing boundaries? At least a beginning has been made, says the optimist. Now buffets in open Now you need not worry about money if you wish to have a sumptuous buffet. Many restaurants and sweet shops in Panchkula are now serving the area residents a delightful meal for just about Rs 50. A specific mention in this regard goes to Katani sweet shop and restaurant in Panchkulas Sector 16. The restaurant has been serving buffet to clients for sometime now and it has so won over the customers that every night there are about 15 to 20 people sitting in the open enjoying the economic package which includes at a time (in vegetarian menu) vegetable pulao, shahi paneer, mixed vegetable, curd and green salad. Where on the one hand, the shop is doing well to offer variety at cheap rates, on the other its being noticed also for the fact that its using the adjoining government land to enhance business. A corner shop as it is, the section of land adjoining the shop is being used to lay the buffet. A small gate has also been provided on prime land of Panchkula Municipal Council. Wonder if the government was noticing and if this was an encroachment of sorts! Exhibition An art and design exhibition was organised by students who had recently completed the fashion design course at the Institute of Vocational Courses, being run by the Punjab Ex-servicemen Corporation (PESCO) at Sector 34. The exhibition was inaugurated by Brig K.S. Chandpuri, whom the popular Hindi film Border is based. He appreciated the work done by the students. He also went around the institutions computer laboratory as well as the finance and taxation courses being run for the wards of ex-servicemen. Chairman of PESCO, Maj Gen- U.S. Sidhu, informed the gathering that in the last batch, the institute had trained 92 students in various employment oriented courses. A preparatory course for NDA entrance examination is also being started shortly. Green action plan The Environment Society of India (ESI) and its sister organisations have welcomed the Green Action Plan (GAP) launched by the Chandigarh Administration and the constitution of a task force under the chairmanship of the Deputy Conservator of Forest with members from Horticulture organisations of CPWD, Chandigarh Administration and the Municipal Corporation of Chandigarh. The GAP lays more stress on planting of native trees not only in the sectors but also in the leisure valley. Under this plan, saplings are supplied to the individuals, NGOs and GOs free of cost from the five nurseries of the forest department located around the city. However, a visit to these nurseries reveal that neem and mango (nature plants) saplings are not available. To support the GAP, the ESI has started raising these saplings at its nurseries and will supply 10,000 such plants next year. The GAP has not mentioned the important aspects of plantation. Pits should be of the size of 1x1x1 metres. The soil should be mixed with rotten cowdung in the ratio of 3:1 parts. Planting distance depends upon the spread of the tree. In most cases, the citizens dont remove the plastic bags and the plant do not develop and die. To support this campaign, the ESI has organised a number of workshops in and around the city. Nothing will happen On Thursday, a Chandigarh Tribune team went to the Mani Majra motor market to do a story on encroachment there. While the lenseman was busy taking pictures of the encroachments, the correspondent decided to speak to a scrap dealer who had piled up junk in corridor and was thus blocking the passage. When the correspondent asked him why he had blocked the corridors, he snapped back: Who are you to question me? With a little hesitation, the correspondent introduced himself. The scrap dealer, became somewhat docile. The correspondent rephrased his question and asked: Doesnt the Municipal Corporation people ask you to clear the corridor? The dealer smiled and replied with an air of confidence: Nothing will happen. Sentinel",{},"['tribune', 'shop', 'sector', 'number', 'india', 'allottees', 'residents', 'administration', 'chandigarh', 'congress', 'mr', 'floor']","CHANDIGARH CALLING Strange are the ways of the Chandigarh Housing Board(CHB).

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/7/2006 0:00,,"Need to bring villages under MC: Bansal Says this will remove imbalance in urban and rural areas Tribune News Service Chandigarh, August 6 The Minister of State for Finance, Mr Pawan Kumar Bansal, today endorsed the plan of the Chandigarh Administration to regularise constructions in the pherni of the UT villages. This was the only way out to bring the villages at par with the urban areas, he said. Addressing a Rural Conference at Kajheri village here today, Mr Bansal, who is the Member of Parliament from Chandigarh, said it was necessary to bring the villages under Municipal Corporation to remove the imbalance in the urban and rural areas. The inclusion would bring the rural property at par with the urban property. Pointing towards the gram panchayats which were protesting against the inclusion of villages in the Municipal Corporation, he said there was misconception which was being exploited by opposition parties. Mr Didar Singh, Chairman of the Panchayat Samiti, while sharing the dias with the MP, said the consent of the Panchayats and other representatives of the villages should be taken before effecting the inclusion. Though the show of strength by the Congress was staged to show that there were few takers for the non-inclusion of the villages in the Municipal Corporation, a few sarpanches and representatives of the Panchayati Raj institutions were conspicuous by their absence from the conference. Assuring the villagers that no construction outside the Lal Dora would be demolished, the minister said the relevance of lal dora had lost its significance. The land would be exempted from the Periphery Control Act for planning for growth up to 2021. An environment shield will be developed around villages to mark the area beyond which no construction will be allowed. In a proposal of the UT Administration to cover all UT villages in the Municipal Corporation, the UT has decided to include five villages in the first step including Hallo Majra, Dadu Majra, Maloya, Palsora and Kajheri. Mr Bhupinder Badheri, General Secretary of the Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee, said inclusion of villages in the MC would save the structures outside the lal dora. He called upon the leaders of all political parties to support the cause of the villagers. Mr Surinder Singh, Mayor of the Municipal Corporation, said for the pockets in Mani Majra and Deep Complex, Hallo Majra, against which the Administration had issued notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, exemption would be taken. At least 15 representatives of the villagers in a recent memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner had opposed the move to include all the villages in the MC. While participating in the conference, the representatives of the Welfare Society of the 50 UT villagers Capital Project Chandigarh, protested against the failure of the MP in rehabilitating their uprooted families. A memorandum of the society was given to the MP. They demanded the 1950 rehabilitation scheme for the 5000 families of the oustees.",{},"['representatives', 'tribune', 'corporation', 'villagers', 'india', 'ut', 'municipal', 'rural', 'chandigarh', 'mr', 'urban', 'villages']","This was the only way out to bring the villages at par with the urban areas, he said.

He had installed hoardings at various places giving an impression that the memorial function of Guru Tegh Bahadur was organised by the gurdwara committee. Sikhs present at the function wished to have a glimpse of their committee leader seated on the dais, but they were disappointed. Paying lip service While the CPI activists in a rally held recently chanted slogans ""Dilli sarkar murdabad"", passers-by said in a low voice, ""party ko paise do, paise do"". They laughed at the rally saying that it had become a ritual of the political parties to take out rally once or twice a year, showing their presence to the government and others in power. They collect finance from their loyal workers by organising rallies and dharnas. Even the police personnel who were escorting the rally said this was all drama. The political parties take out rallies during elections, parliamentary sessions and other such occasions. They are not serious about taking up the issues of the people and only pay lip service. They show their strength to the government by organising rallies and dharnas. Mosquito rules the roost With the rains back to the Capital over the last week, major universities providing on campus accommodation are worried about the increasing mosquito bites that the students have been reporting. Most colleges are taking all the measures possible to avoid any dengue case. Be it JNU, DU or Jamia, all major universities are struggling hard to avoid an outbreak. Meanwhile, students have a fan page on Facebook, flaunting pictures of their mosquito bites. ""These arent mosquitoes. They appear to be something else. They leave freakish marks on the body, which are very hard to get rid of. We thought of having some fun out of the situation, and hence started this page on Facebook. We already have more then 4,000 members,"" said Suman Verma, one of the residents at JNU. Missing children In sync with the common trend, the Delhi police seems to be following different yardsticks for the rich and the poor when it comes to acting upon cases related to missing children. The panelists of a public hearing pertaining to the issues surrounding ""missing children"" almost remained silent when the parents of such kids expressed wide dissent against the Delhi polices apathy towards the poor. When complaints against the police poured in, additional commissioner of special protection unit for women and children K Choudhary, having little to defend his force, assured the complainants that the guilty would be punished. Then came strong words from the member of the National Advisory Council, Harsh Mander, who said that all the instances highlighted here show a dereliction of duty and lack of accountability on the part of the police.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/10/2009 0:00,,"CityScope Letters Public servants turning khaas aadmis This is with reference to Raveen Thukrals write up, The khas aadami, published in Chandigarh Tribune on August 3. Politicians, police and bureaucrats manipulated a self-justified perception of security risk to avail the facility of police escorts just to use them as their and their familys personal servants, these police escorts openly misuse the public land, use free electricity and water by unauthorised connections and have become a public nuisance. The so-called VVIP wards often misuse their police guards to thrash their opponents and exhibit a vulgar show of power. It is more astonishing that in spite of being reported by the media repeatedly, no action is being taken by the higher authorities to end this menace. Chief Ministers of both the states, Directors General of Police and the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court are the silent spectators of this wilful violation of the law of the land. Why a licence is given to such officials to break the well-established norms of the society and the law of the land. In a Democratic system like ours, every one is equal to law, which must be adhered in the letters and spirit. The high court must bring such violators to justice by honouring the strong public and medias reaction on this issue. Capt Amar Jeet Kumar, Mohali VIPs flaunt status You have written a very hard-hitting piece on VIPs. But does writing such article works, when the VIP will remain the same and continue to scare the aam aadmi! You have rightly said, ""But alas! whatever the law might say, the truth is that VIPs do enjoy a khaas status in our society and moreover, they love to flaunt it."" It gives a lot of pain to see India, when compared to Canada and other western countries. Prikshat Verma, Canada Common man suffers Social activists are clamouring for a check of the mindset of the power brigade. But will this mindset change come voluntarily is what haunts the common person. A poor man steals power for his use because the administration has failed to provide the electricity. The electricity department was forced to withdraw disconnecting kundi connections in Colony No 5 in the wake of protests in the form of roadblocks by the jhuggi-dwellers. It will remain helpless to enforce the disconnection owing to the power wielded by the VIPs. It is clear that the Electricity Act 2003 providing for fines and punishment is no deterrent to this dominant class of people and relates only to a common man. Satish Chandra Sharma Practical difference Although the Constitution of India has not recognised any difference between the khaas and aam aadmi, Being a VIP in our country is like a blank cheque encashable anywhere. It is unfortunate that VIPs end up making a mockery of it with impunity. No VIP or celebrity in our country can be booked on the petty charge of drunk driving, on which The Alexandria, Fairfax County Police Chief, was arrested by the Arlington County Police. When persons like Sanjeev Nanda could get away with just two years imprisonment in the BMW case because of his clout even after killing six persons, it is difficult to imagine politicians and bureaucrats behaving like Aam aadmi. Most of the protectees enjoying VIP security on government expense are not under any real threat to their lives. Pruning of VIP security to undeserving protectees may save several crores of taxpayers hard-earned money annually. Lajpat Rai Garg, Panchkula Overhaul mindset In his bold and eye-opening write up, Raveen Thukral has painstakingly brought forward another issue of not only public interest but also imbibing greater moral value in his bona fide endeavours to shake our moribund conscience to awake to see the meaning of democratic republic. Whichever government is in power, it considers the state its private estate and people as servile only for exploitation. We, therefore, as citizens of a democratic republic of India, should obey and respect laws of the land, do our work or assigned duty honestly and conscientiously and resist undue pressure of the vested interests howsoever great they may be. To achieve the noble goal of fearless and free life, as aam aadmi, we must overhaul our mindset and act valorously not to succumb to the undue pressures of the powers if we want a truly democratic republic of India. Gurmit Singh Saini, Mohali Need to take revolutionary steps It is true that in our country a khaas aadmi is khaas, while aam aadmi is aam till some revolutionary steps are not taken to remove the difference. Whenever a khaas aadmi is entangled in some scam, he immediately needs medical help, as that is the safest way for him to escape such scams. I have never seen any forces accompanying VIPs in other countries. The simple reason is that the life of a khaas aadmi in our country is precious so he needs protection and that of aam aadmi is not so precious. Rakesh Ahluwalia, Ambala City VIP culture only in India The VIP culture is found in India only. In other countries there are no such people called the VIPs. Every person is equal in the eyes of the law. But in India, anyone who is given a responsible position treats himself above the law. They feel they can violate the laws without being punished. If these so called khaas aadmis give up their habit of violating the law, I am sure the aam aadmi in our country will never dare to break the laws. Everyone is equal in status and respect in the US. It is only in our country where the VIP culture prevails. Ours is surely a feudalistic country.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/5/2005 0:00,,"Women face lathis to fight drug peddlers Four chemist shops sealed Nirupama Dutt Tribune News Service A shopkeeper used to open bottles of cough syrups and sell the contents by the peg. No more of this will be allowed here, says Subedar Kaka Singh, sarpanch of Roorhki Heeran. Lutheri (Ropar), August 4 Lutheri, an obscure village in Ropar district, 7 km from Morinda, could well provide a model for protest against growing drug addiction in Punjab. Though there have been sporadic protests against liquor shops in Punjab villages, this seems to be the first ever organised protest against synthetic drugs retailed through chemist shops. The unique community initiative that started some 10 days ago with women and village elders coming out in the streets has forced the administration to intervene and four chemist shops in the village have been sealed. A visit to the village found sarpanch Gurdev Singh adamant that these shops be closed. Two of these four shops had become notorious for supplying drugs to the entire region. Lutheri had become the Mecca of drug addicts. Even our children and girls have succumbed to these addictions, he says. The scene in Lutheri and the neighbouring Roorhki Heeran village is dismal indeed and there have been four deaths due to this malaise in the latter village. Families have been ruined and many women and children turned destitute. The drugs commonly used in the area are diazepam, cough syrups and morphine injections, which were all available for the asking. The situation led to the setting up of the Nasha Virodhi Action Committee. Raising slogans such as Maheena dena band karo, Nashe vechane band karo, women were not even afraid to suffer police lathi blows during a chakka jam on July 27. Telling the story of her 26-year-old son, Krishna Devi (52) of Roorhki Heeran breaks down, My son has been taking tablets, syrups and injections for the past five years. He was a good carpenter, but has lost interest in work. Barjinder Kaur (30), mother of three children, has been reduced to penury as her mason husband has taken to drugs. I sometimes bring money from my mother and sometimes have to go to bed hungry, she sobs. Subedar Kaka Singh, sarpanch of Roorhki Heeran, says, My son started taking tablets and capsules in Class XI. Today he is a wasted boy of 22. We even kept him chained at home. The easy availability of drugs in the village has destroyed us. Such harrowing tales are to be found from home to home and from village to village in this area. The villagers also say that young boys would come from cities in cars to fetch these drugs in the wholesale at Lutheri. Commending the initiative of the villagers, Mr Manmohan Sharma, Secretary, Voluntary Health Association of Punjab (VHAP), says, Only community and societal efforts can check addiction. This is the foremost problem in the state today. The government has failed to do anything and there is little hope from it in near future. We need more movements in the state on the pattern of Alcoholics Anonymous. The VHAP convened a meeting at Ludhiana on August 28 of various groups and individuals working in the area of de-addiction to launch a strategic and sustainable campaign. This can be possible only with complete involvement of the community, says Sharma. The loud protest by the community, however, has brought assurances from Mr Harjit Inder Singh Grewal, Deputy Commissioner, Ropar, to the villagers. Visiting the village gurdwara yesterday and addressing a gathering of people from eight villages, he said, I pledge by Guru Granth Sahib that soon you will see stern action against the shopkeepers selling restricted drugs. The villagers have decided that they will not keep quiet and the action committee has decided to march up to Chamkaur Sahib waving black flags to raise awareness against drugs. This is how we are going to celebrate Independence Day this time.

You have already placed an order for the logs and have asked your gardener to scrape together enough twigs. This is not all. The whisky bottles are all nicely tucked in a carved cabinet, to be taken out on January 13. Even the cut glasses have been nicely washed and wiped. Or else, you have called up all your chums for going to the University campus for celebrating the occasion at the Students Centre. Everythings ready, except the cool stuff you wish to wear for setting the hot evening on fire. Worry not, here is a comprehensive head-to-toe guide, compiled with caution, just for making the inflamed hearts of revellers around burn with a fiery desire, along with ignited timber and dry leaves. First of all, go in for a nice headgear. Golf caps look cool, but not in the evenings principally during formal occasions, affirms city-based fashion designer Zameera. Do not buy monkey caps covering your visage either, even for the heck of creating suspense and sensation. Go in good caps with Santa touch. Pick up the ones in woolly black or red. You can take one home by pulling out less than Rs 300 from your wallet. If somehow you hate wearing caps during the parties, buy pretty pony holders. Agreeing with her, chunk jewellery shop owner Raman says, You can turn your Plain Jane pony-tail into a hot hair style with the assistance of elastic bedecked with sparkly faux jewels, even sequined pom-poms. The elastics are inexpensive. You can buy them form anywhere by paying just Rs 75 from your pocket. Next, go in for gold. Nay, not the real thing, but gilt goodies in golden hues, with beads and sequins of the same shade, for a shot of glamour. ""Choose a headband with sequins, Delhi-based designer Sonal suggests over the phone. You can get one for just Rs 100. Team it up with an off-shoulder top and sequined pants. Wear the out-fit with glittery slip-ons and a floral belt. You can also savour the evening by putting on sheer lace pants. Planning to twirl around the fire in a skirt? Go in for one that is neatly embroidered with sequins. Don it with a tissue bustier, nothing less. If chilly, bone-piercing, winds scare you to tremble, wrap a stole around your shoulders. Acquire a lace stole, Sonal recommends. You will not have be forced to pay more than Rs 850 if you buy it from the right shop. Thats why you should survey first and shop later. Also remember to carry a beaded bag. It is in, looks cool and is essential for carrying mobile and car keys, Sonal asserts. It is better to keep the keys in a bag rather than misplace them and look for a duplicate one. This is not all. Sequin bag gives any outfit a trendy party look, It will accessorize the evening ensemble in a way everyone is sure to love, she concludes. Thats all folks.

The committee will be headed by Additional Deputy Commissioner and secretary, Red Cross. The executive officers of HUDA and MC, along with representatives of the Vyapar Mandal, will be its members. The committee will interact with all parties involved, including the general public, before submitting its report within a month. Yesterday shopkeepers had observed a strike and staged a protest march against the proposed paid parking system in the town. They raised objections over the scheme, stating that it would affect their business, as a majority of markets were situated inside the sectors, where only local people go for shopping. Moreover, there was a need to improve the parking lots, which fell short of space due to the increase in the number of cars in the town in recent years. The sequence of events is enough to substantiate that the district administration had to eat humble pie due to its haste in introducing the paid parking system in the town, and that also with the help of the Red Cross Society, which has no business in such issues. While the DC claimed to have emulated the pattern of Chandigarh to streamline parking in markets, he perhaps forgot to follow the procedure adopted by Chandigarh for such auctions. In Chandigarh, at least a period of four days is given to the interested parties to prepare for participating in the auctions. In Panchkula, an unusual haste was made in auctioning the parking lots within 24 days of advertising it in the newspapers. Secondly, no groundwork was carried out to fix a floor price for the auction, leaving the scope of exploitation of situation by the bidders by forming the cartel. That was perhaps the reason behind the price of final auction of Sector 11, which fetch only a little over Rs 18 lakh, while the last auction for a similar market of Sector 35-C in Chandigarh got a whopping sum of Rs 41 lakh in the kitty of the Chandigarh administration. Lastly, no parking fee is levied in the internal markets of Sectors in Chandigarh. Meanwhile, sources in the municipal council said while the civic body was asked by the Deputy Commissioner in the monthly meetings to take the responsibility of parking in markets of the town, the land was never transferred to it. HUDA was owning the land and its authorities never got ready to transfer the parking space to the MC despite the fact they verbally agreed to raise no objection over the management of parking by the MC, said the sources.",{},"['tribune', 'committee', 'mc', 'paid', 'india', 'parking', 'markets', 'system', 'objections', 'deputy', 'town', 'chandigarh']","The executive officers of HUDA and MC, along with representatives of the Vyapar Mandal, will be its members.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,10/1/2000 0:00,,"HEALTH Nothing like avoiding surgery Tribune News Service CHANDIGARH, Sept 30  The first ever live demonstration of Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) procedure to treat liver cancer, performed at the PGI, evoked varied responses from the doctors attending a workshop on Imaging and interventions in hepatic tumour, here today. The visiting doctors, Dr Sanjay Saini from Boston and Dr Luigi Solbiati from Busto, Italy, advocated this breakthrough technique in minimally invasive surgical procedure for curing liver carcinoma as it makes economic sense besides involving minimum possible mental and physical trauma to the patients. If you can avoid surgery, nothing like it, said Dr Saini. The Indian doctors were of the view that the technique may hold good for advanced countries. It is, however, required to first evaluate its usefulness because of an altogether different etiology of liver cancer in the country. RFA as a technique, uses electrodes, which give electro frequency at 200 watts. This thermal energy burns the tumour with the help of a probe positioned within the tumours under ultrasound guidance. The conventional treatment of liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma includes surgery and chemotherapy. Methods which are cost effective but more morbid and painful. According to Dr D.N. Srivastava from the AIIMS, Delhi, RFA helps cure the tumour or lesion in its primary stages.  We still do not have good screening programmes. As a result, we get patients in varying advanced stages. Dr Sanjay Baijal from PGI, Lukhnow, agrees, Screening procedures abroad are very aggressive. We dont have an experience, long enough, to say whether this technique would eventually be better suited than surgery. Surgery, in this case, still remains time tested. Dr Saini agrees that more time is required to make RFA widely accepted. In this case, we are at the stage, like the earlier debate on whether angioplasty or surgery was better suited for heart disorders. Abroad, latest trends in medicine include minimal invasive procedures regardless of trends. RFA entails less morbidity and cost of hospitalisation. In foreign countries it makes economic sense to minimise hospital stay, which might exceed cost of a surgical procedure. In India it is the other way round. Therefore it is not fair to compare feasibility of RFA, here and abroad. Early detection picks up tumours as small as 0.5 centimeters, ultimately reducing hospital expenditure and trauma to the patient, assert Dr Saini. However, keeping in mind all possible factors, he says that surgical solution should be the first option, at least for the time being Maybe after five years, and enough research down the line, it may emerge as the first option. Dr Luigi Solbiati, who has done pioneering work in the field agrees that Indian hospitals receive delayed cases of liver carcinoma. For a percutaneous non-surgery, tumours have to be medium sized. We have treated larger tumours with the technique, but only in combination with conventional techniques like chemoembolisation. For very large tumours, RFA may not be enough. Dr K.S. Soin, a doctor running a private practice in Ludhiana felt that presentation of a new technique was welcome in the country. However, a complete evaluation is required because, unlike Italy or USA, liver tumours in India are not only due to alcohol. Here non- cirrhotic portal fibrosis caused due to adulterated food or water and hepatitis-B and C are very common. The workshop was earlier inaugurated by Prof S.K. Sharma, Director, PGI, who while speaking on the importance of interventional radiology commented that many surgical procedures are being replaced by non-invasive procedures. Dr Sudha Suri, Head, Radiodiagnosis, stressed upon the importance of this breakthrough technique as liver cancer was quite common in the country. Unfortunately, it is diagnosed very late in India. RFA could be an alternative to surgery in early cases.",{},"['tumours', 'tribune', 'saini', 'cancer', 'india', 'dr', 'technique', 'surgery', 'procedures', 'rfa', 'chandigarh', 'surgical', 'liver']","It is, however, required to first evaluate its usefulness because of an altogether different etiology of liver cancer in the country.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/6/2005 0:00,,"Readers Write Pitiable condition of road The condition of the road between Mohalis Furniture Market chowk and the crossing of Sectors 36, 37, 42, 43 is very bad. It is full of potholes and pits. The portion of the road, particularly between Dr Ambedkar Institute of Hotel Management and the above roundabout, is the worst. There is every likelihood road of an accident taking place anytime. This is the second busiest road which connects the residents of Mohali with Chandigarh. The memorial of the late Beant Singh, Chief Minister of Punjab, lies on this road. Big dignitaries and other VIPs visit the place to pay their homage. It is surprising that it has not caught the attention of the authorities. Most of the students take the route as it is the straight road leading to various colleges on Sectors 42 and 11. I hope the authorities will wake up and repair the road at the earliest to redress the grievances of the public. B.S. Kaberwal, Mohali Patiala MC, pull up socks With great pomp and show, the Punjab Government established the Municipal Corporation of Patiala. The office of former Municipal Committee was in Dharampura Bazar and it was easily approachable from all parts of city. The first burden which the corporation put on the people was to construct palatial building for itself near National Sport Complex which is one extreme corner of the city. It became very difficult for the people to approach the corporation office. Crores of rupees were spent and the taxpayers money was wasted. Streetlights were maintained by the Punjab State Electricity Board and the system was working properly. With great fanfare, it was taken up by the corporation in the name of improving streetlight. It handed over the maintenance work to a contractor who employed a few electricians and helpers and purchased a few wooden stairs to climb on the poles. No improvement over the PSEBs work was noticed. The worst was yet to follow. In June 2005, the contractor was removed and the JE corporation started maintaining streetlights. Now the lights on main roads can be seen only. Most of the colonies are in the dark as the JE concerned does not bother about their maintenance. Regarding water supply, the water hardly reaches up to the water meter level. It does not reach the ground floor, what to talk of the first floor. Of course, the authorities do not forget to assure that everything has been done to improve the supply of water. Stray cattle can be seen wondering everywhere. Bazars are very narrow and frequently there are traffic jams, putting the people to great inconvenience. Nothing is done to stop the movements of cars, trucks or three-wheelers by the corporation in the narrow bazars. In most colonies, the roads are 20 feet wide. On both sides, every house has 2.5 feet width unauthorisedly occupied. Thus the colony roads remain only 15 feet wide. The municipality has taken no action. To add to the woes of common man, many people keep their cars in the streets. While there is time limit for constructing houses in PUDA colonies, there is no such provision in colonies like Officer Colony, Malwa Colony, Good Earth Colony, Khakhar Complex, Doctors Enclave etc. People who purchased plots at throwaway prices, do not construct houses. Neither do they maintain these plots properly. The result is that these become dump houses. Two such plots are in front of 81-A in Good Earth Colony. On one side of these plots, a dirty rivulet flow which emanates pungent smell. Just at a distance of half a km from the CMs residence, there is a temple of Lord Shiva and other deities on Kheri Road main market. A local MLC has his property dealing business there. Previously, he was president of Patiala Municipal Committee. Neither the CM of Punjab, nor his wife who is MP from Patiala nor this gentleman MLC bothers. K.K. Bhardwaj Patiala Roadways staff need counselling The write-up titled Booming business for dhabawalas (October 21) has highlighted a problem that has affected a majority of the passengers travelling between Chandigarh and Delhi on Haryana Roadways buses. There is no denying the fact that Haryana has a very good fleet of buses, well furnished and well designed for utmost public comfort and convenience. Yet, its staff, that is conductors and drivers, consist mostly of uncouth and unsophisticated individuals who smoke bidis in running buses, make unscheduled halts and stoppages without even the basic courtesy of informing the passengers about the duration of the halt at a designated stand or a dhaba for their freebies. They non-chalantly leave the bus for 20 to 30 minutes at some remote stop of their choice and disappear. They suddenly re-enter the bus and abruptly move the vehicle without any horn or caution to the passengers waiting for them outside. They, perhaps, treat the passengers as cargo or as chicken and broliers being transported by them. They need some counselling in this regard. It is time the Haryana Road Transport Department took suitable remedial measures to plug the loopholes in its otherwise enviable bus service- perhaps one of the few best in the country to earn the sobriquet, Punjabs envy, Haryanas pride. The journey time between Chandigarh and Delhi can perhaps also be reduced by about half an hour. SP Singh Chandigarh HDFC bank rule defies logic I have a saving account No. 1161160002643 in HDFC Bank, Leela Bhavan, Patiala. In September, 2004, I was transferred to Chandigarh as DDPI (Colleges), Punjab in the DPI (Colleges), Punjab office. The pay of employees of the DPI office is deposited in their respective accounts in the HDFC Bank, Sector 17, Chandigarh. On my new appointment, I approached the manager of HDFC Bank branch of Sector 17 to open my new account so that my pay could be deposited in that account. The officer concerned told me that as I had an account in Leela Bhavan, Patiala branch, I need not open a fresh account in the Sector 17 branch and my account in Patiala would be considered for all purposes. My pay for all those months was credited to my old account.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/14/2003 0:00,,"15-year-old boy brutally murdered in Patiala Tribune News Service Patiala, November 13 For 15-year-old James John, the absence of his parents from their home in Sukhram Colony adjoining the diesel component works complex in the city proved very costly. Left alone at home, the boy was brutally murdered last night. Circumstantial evidence points out that James might have opened the main door of his home to let in the assailants. There is no evidence of a break-in nor is anything missing from the house. It could be possible that the assailants were known to James because his immediate neighbours did not hear any worrying noise last night. The murder was discovered this morning when James friend Lakhwinder came to collect a pair of sports shoes he had lent to the boy earlier. Lakhwinder, who came to the house at around 8 am, says he found the outer gate open and when he entered the premises of the house he found that the entry door was also not locked. Lakhwinder said when he went to the bedroom, in which James used to sleep, he found him lying with blood splattered on the mattress. Lakhwinder says James legs had been tied with an old pant while his hands had been tied after tearing a bed-sheet. He said part of the bed-sheet was also used to throttle James. The boy said there was a wound on James forehead indicating that he might have been bludgeoned and that a long thick metal needle used to tie gunny bags was probably used to puncture several holes in James stomach. A visit to the scene of the crime revealed a spartan room with a double bed, a folding single bed and a study table. One of the mattresses and part of a pillow was splattered with blood. James father and mother both work in the Punjab State Electricity Board. While his father TV John is a storekeeper in the Central Store near the railway station, his mother Tangamma is a typist in the north subdivision of the board. His mother had been operated on for a brain tumour recently and left Patiala for Ludhiana on Tuesday to receive chemeotherapy treatment. The body of the boy, who was studying in Class IX in Vir Haqiqat Rai School in the city, has been sent for postmortem. Though the postmortem report will be released tomorrow, doctors said the death seemed to have occurred last night. Tangamma John was not without friends following the murder of her son. While her Christian friends took some time to rush to her side, her Punjabi neighbours thronged her house immediately after coming to know about the tragedy to console her in her moment of grief. Tangamma, who hails from Tiruvalla in Kerala, and was in Ludhiana this morning where she had gone to get medical treatment, came home to be received by grieving neighbours who had collected at her house. Tangamma herself admitted this fact, saying you can see the love and affection my neighbours have for me yourself. She said she had been living in the present colony since more than 12 years, adding her husband had been living in the city since 1973. She said she herself had come to the city around 21 years back. The 48-year-old woman also claimed that she had always been at good terms with her neighbours and other people of the colony and could not visualise any reason for the murder of her son. Karamjit Kaur, a neighbour, says she was planning to come to the Christian house today to ascertain about behenjis health when she came to know about the tragedy which had be fallen the household. Tangammas friend Alice from Cheeka in Haryana and Mohini who lives in the Mohindra Colony in the city also claimed that the couple were enjoying good relations with their neighbours.",{},"['boy', 'tribune', 'used', 'came', 'tangamma', 'colony', 'india', 'james', 'lakhwinder', 'chandigarh', 'neighbours', 'house', 'city']","Circumstantial evidence points out that James might have opened the main door of his home to let in the assailants.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,4/8/2007 0:00,,"Chandigarh, April 7 Panic bells have started to ring in the Industrial Area as the Chandigarh administration has issued more than 200 notices for misuse of godowns and other plots. A majority of offenders are engaged in commercial activity, particularly sale of products not manufactured here. This is not allowed under the allotment policy. The Estate Office has warned that the lease of the site could be cancelled and 10 per cent of the site premium plus ground rent can be forfeited. In case of an unsatisfactory reply, the matter will be decided ex parte. The administration has fixed sizeable monthly charges in different categories, in case the misuse continues. These plots were originally allotted for industry purposes. The owners changed the use of property for commercial purposes. The change occurred more than two decades ago in a large number of cases, but notices were never a cause for panic before. Industrial plot owners see the development as arm-twisting by the administration to force them to opt for conversion. Official sources maintain that the practice is illegal and lack of punitive action in the past was no reason for allowing the activity to go on. ""Look at the demolitions in Delhi to remove illegal constructions. It is a fact that traders carrying out the sale here are affecting business in the city"". An industrialist said: ""The average response to the conversion has led to the administration trying a new method to force conversion.

Sources in the corporation revealed that on the suggestion of the fire department, the MC authorities had purchased inflatable boats and inflatable lighting system costing lakhs of rupees, to handle fire incidents at Sukhna Lake or during floods. Officials said at seven fire stations, one vehicle had been installed with inflatable lighting system, which could be used during night hours at places where there was no facility of proper light. As per the report of the fire department, five vehicles were sent to the spot to control the fire and the fire teams used only one inflatable light system and a dragon searchlight to extinguish the fire. Sources revealed that inflatable lights were not in a working condition in the vehicles, which were sent to the spot by the fire stations, as the department does not maintain them regularly. Officials said the department purchased these lights so that firemen did not have to hold these during the fire-fighting operations and these hi-tech lights made the vision clear for them.

Officials said a special vehicle had been purchased by the fire department, which is parked at the Mani Majra fire station having portable pump, especially for such areas, which are surrounded by water.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/4/2002 0:00,,"FAUJI BEAT Put national security above political interest T HERE is an inborn obsession in the minds of our politicians and bureaucrats that a strong Army does not augur well for the country. No wonder then that all proposals to increase the strength of the Army or equip it with better weaponry are watered down by them. A few years ago, bureaucrats felt that the Rashtriya Rifles (RR) battalions, having the Army manpower, make the Army a bigger force. This led the Fifth Pay Commission to make a recommendation that the RR battalions (36 in all) be disbanded and the internal security which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) should be given to the CRPF. The commission also said the Army should be used for internal security duties very rarely. Thank God, these battalions were not disbanded, otherwise we would have cut a very sorry figure in combating the militancy in Jammu & Kashmir, especially at such times when the Army is committed on the borders. Why our bureaucracy makes such hollow recommendations when it knows fully well that the CRPF cannot handle the internal security duties independently? Take the recent example of Gujarat, where an Army brigade had to be pulled out from its operational commitment to quell rioting. Mercifully, instead of disbanding the RR battalions, it was decided in April last year that 30 more RR battalions would be raised in the next five years. And to increase their operational effectiveness, this force would be made a regular component of the Army. Admittedly, India would become a much stronger country the day our political pandits stop putting their political interests above countrys national security. Resettlement of ex-servicemen Over 55,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen retire every year; majority of them in their thirties, while most of the officers retire in their early fifties. The age expectancy having gone beyond 65 years, a large number of them have to seek a long second career. Opportunities for the resettlement of ex-servicemen in India are very few and these too are smeared with graft. The Resettlement Directorate of the Ministry of Defence cannot provide suitable jobs to more than one per cent of ex-servicemen who retire every year. Most of the state governments have reserved a percentage of vacancies for ex-servicemen but only a few of them are filled because the ex-soldiers neither have a political clout nor money to pay for the civil jobs. In several cases these jobs are denied to them on one pretext or another. Take the recent example of Punjab, where the Chief Minister had to give directions that the benefit of reserved vacancies would be given to ex-servicemen for the second and subsequent times even when they had availed of this benefit in one service earlier. This benefit was denied to them despite the Punjab Recruitment of Ex-Servicemen Rules, 1983, allowing this concession to them. There are many schemes with the Directorate General Resettlement (DGR) for self-employment of ex-servicemen for which liberal loans are also available from banks. But these schemes generally do not find favour with ex-servicemen because they are not psychologically prepared during their service to handle such projects. Armys reserve manpower In an all-out modern war, even when it is not a prolonged one, the rate of casualties is likely to be very high, thanks to the hi-tech and sophisticated weaponry and equipment. The shortfall in manpower due to casualties has to be made up after every intense battle so that the fighting potential of units and sub-units does not suffer. For this, all armies have their reserves. The reserve, as a rule, should be of the same strength as that of an army. While Pakistan with an army of 5.5 lakh, has a reserve of over 5 lakh, India, with a much larger Army of 1.1 million, has less than 45,000 personnel in reserve. This reserve force is too small to sustain an army in war. What has brought the Indian Army to this unhappy pass? Until the seventies, a jawan served in the Army for seven years, the period called colour service, after which he was transferred to reserve for eight years. During this period he was liable to be recalled to colour service in case of a national emergency. In the late 70s, the colour service was increased from seven to 17 years. This has adversely affected the reserve force of the Army. That our planners have accepted the current system which has almost deprived the Army of its reserve force is unimaginable. This manpower imbalance must be removed if the country wants to fight a war.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,12/25/2002 0:00,,"LIFE & STYLE GLITZ & GLAMOUR Get gorgeous on New Years Eve Saurabh Malik Tribune News Service Your anxious eyes looking for something hot and simmering to don for setting the New Year night on fire will not lose sight of the burning ambition. No, not any more. Here is a classified catalogue of citys most wanted concepts and stuff compiled just to make you look gorgeous for the evening affair. First of all, make scent your secret weapon. It is expensive, but worth the dough you pull out of your purse. Arm yourself with the power of perfume by camouflaging yourself under the shield of a scrumptious scent, suggests make-up artist Priyam. Just make sure that your perfume is not strong enough to distract revelers around you. Remember, the scent you wear should create a lingering presence. Another thing. You can enhance the fragrance simply by going for bath and body products with a similar redolence, Priyam adds. Apply fragrance to warm parts of your body, pulse points, nape of your neck, behind the ears and inside your wrists. Also, store perfume in a cool, dry place with constant temperature. Never ever expose scent to suns direct rays, even strong light, Priyam concludes. It is best to store it in its packaging. Before leaving the cozy comfort of your dressing room on December 31 also make sure your tresses are as shimmering as your gold lame tank top. Dont blow dry your hair, just let the cool winter breeze do the work for you, asserts fashion designer Neha. The reason is not hard to see. Not-quite-straight, not-quite-curly, texture simply looks great. For securing plush strands, use a hair softening styling cream to make the dried ends feel supple. Rub a dollop between your palms before applying, she says. The process will help it melt into your mane. If you feel like restraining your tresses from running in all directions, go in for a beaded elastic band, or a furry one. Even a stone bun pin looks chic, Neha asserts. Buy headbands only if you have a baby face everyone admires. Good ponytail holders, including the mirrored ones, are also on display for you under the dazzling lights in chunk jewelry shops. You can also wear hats and caps. It all depends on you. Pay attention to make-up also. Paint your lips a deep burgundy for that hard-to-resist look. You can also try wine-coloured lipstick. Damsels of the world can also apply a gloss to give lips just a dash of colour, Neha suggests. In any case, they should skip the lip liner routine and use fingers to spread colour and gloss all over the mouth for that luscious look. Always remember to brush on a shade of eye shadow that matches your eyebrows as a brow definer. Brighten up your eyes with a thick coat of black mascara, she adds. You will be able to keep the look natural this way. Otherwise, try blue mascara. It will make your eyes look vibrant. Also moisturise the face with glycerin and rose water. The story doesnt end here. Drink at least two liters of water a day for staying hydrated. For a flawless-looking complexion, you will need an extremely long lasting foundation. Keep the effect dewy by applying a moisturiser first. Slap on the moisturising cream when the bathroom is steamy and your skin still damp from shower, she insists. So far as colours go, pink is all time favourite. You can always combine white and pink for that soft, yet stunning look, Delhi-based fashion designer Ayesha whispers over the phone. Purple too is a rage, but if somehow you do not appreciate the hue, go in for black. It is the easiest colour. You can pair it with anything. Have a nice time folks, after all the occasion will come after 365 days.",{},"['tribune', 'look', 'try', 'priyam', 'water', 'india', 'eyes', 'wear', 'neha', 'scent', 'chandigarh', 'perfume', 'colour']","Arm yourself with the power of perfume by camouflaging yourself under the shield of a scrumptious scent, suggests make-up artist Priyam.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,6/21/2004 0:00,,"Vajpayees project in rough weather Rakesh Lohumi Tribune News Service Shimla, June 20 The 50,000-MW hydroelectric initiative launched by the Vajpayee government in May 2003 has run into rough weather with some states protesting against the decision of the Centre to assign projects to various executing agencies without taking them into confidence. The fund-starved hill states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal consider hydroelectric projects as their main resource, which could not be allotted by the Centre unilaterally. In fact, the Government of Uttaranchal has written a letter to the Centre taking strong exception to the manner in which 39 projects had been assigned to various agencies for preparing detailed project reports (DPRs). The Uttaranchal Government has also communicated its inability to allow the Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN) to prepare DPRs for the two projects assigned to it under the hydropower initiative. It has decided to go for international bidding in case of the 230-MW Sela Urthing project and informed that it had no plans to award the 70-MW Bogdiar Sirkari project as of now. It has, however, informed the SJVN that it could consider assigning of some other project if it came up with a concrete proposal on the pattern of Himachal Pradesh. The Himachal Government has also taken a similar line. It has written to the SJVN not to go ahead with the work of preparing DPR for Jangi Thopan, allotted to it by the Centre, as it will lead to unnecessary duplication. The state electricity board had started working on the DPR much earlier and it was nearing completion. The SJVN had been assigned two projects in the state. Sources in the government said the issue had been taken up with the Centre at the officer level. The government maintains that the hydroelectric projects are precious assets of the state and it reserves the right to assign them on its own terms and conditions in its best interests. In all, 162 hydroelectric projects with an aggressive generation capacity of 50,560 MW were assigned under the initiative. The pre-feasibility studies for which funds were granted by the Centre were completed but problems arose when the task of preparing DPR was allotted with an understanding that various state electricity boards and central executing agencies, will also implement the assigned project. Senior officers maintain that the initiative was launched in undue haste and it was patently wrong on the part of the Centre to launch such an ambitious programme without taking the states where the projects were located into confidence. With the change of government at the Centre the whole policy might be reviewed to protect the interest of state.",{},"['project', 'tribune', 'projects', 'uttaranchal', 'various', 'state', 'assigned', 'hydroelectric', 'india', 'initiative', 'chandigarh', 'sjvn', 'centre']","The fund-starved hill states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal consider hydroelectric projects as their main resource, which could not be allotted by the Centre unilaterally.

Chandigarh, June 26 For Manpreet, a 24-year-old residing in the city, life is as bad as it can possibly get. Into drugs now for eight years, Manpreet is now jobless, divorced, heartbroken and in extreme physical distress. Desperate for help, Manpreets father, a Haryana Government employee is a broken man. I have already lost a dear family member to this ill and now I cannot see my son in this condition. Please help him to get over this habit, he pleads. Now Manpreet too regrets having given in to his friends at school to start experimenting with easily available prescription drugs. These were available readily in chemist shops just outside our school. Almost the entire strength of boys in 11th and 12th in my school are into some form of drugs. It was just natural to accompany the seniors to these shops and buy things like phensydryl syrup, proxivan capsules and some injectable drugs from these shops, says Manpreet. After we passed out of school, some of my school friends moved on from these light drugs to smack and I also decided to try that. We came to know about a group of foreign nationals who supplied smack. But they were caught by the police and our supply was stopped. But by then we were hooked. I could not imagine even a single day passing without having my doze of drugs. So we looked for another supplier in the same area. It was a woman, who with the help of a young boy supplied drugs from her residence. But she too was caught and then we started going to the Panjab University for smack. But my job started suffering and soon I was without a job. I shifted from one job to another but could not concentrate on anything. Now it was not a question of drugs giving a high but as medicines for an illness without which it felt as if I will die. Some years back, however, manpreet managed to kick the addiction and after remaining in one of the de-addiction centres in the city, Manpreet was a new person. I fell in love and met the person I later married. I even got another job. And everything started to look up. But things between me and my wife somehow did not workout and we separated and will soon be divorced. Manpreet is now back into drugs. I met my old friends who are still hooked and I could not resist specially when family circumstances were turning so bad. But now three months later I need help. I want to leave this habit and start a new life. But I am scared that I will die. The withdrawal symptoms are so scary and painful that I take sleeping pills in order to sleep every night. There are times when I writhe painfully in the bed at night but resist taking drugs. Sometimes I feel I will die of the pain.he says. Stating that Manpreets case is a typical case of schools students trying light drugs and moving on to become hard core drug abusers, Dr Anil Malhotra, Additional Professor, Drug Deaddiction Centre, PGI, states that the city health authorities need to generate maximum awareness among school students. Dr Malhotra also stated although that drug abusers were equally divided among all various economic sections of the society, choice of drugs varied among the rich and the poor. There are more than 15,000 drug abusers in the city which includes Panchkula and Mohali but the health services in the city are catering to not more than 10 per cent of these, said Dr Malhotra. Reiterating this statement Dr B.S. Chavan, Head of the Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, suggested that in order to be more effective, the health department has to reach out to drug abusers and not simply wait for them to seek medical help. We have the largest number of drug abusers living in the citys periphery and not in the city itself. Landed people sold their property to the Government and they are cash rich. Having little knowledge of where to invest their money, many of their family members get into bad habits which include having these drugs, informed Dr Chavan.",{},"['abusers', 'drug', 'drugs', 'tribune', 'help', 'job', 'manpreet', 'india', 'dr', 'pc', 'chandigarh', 'school', 'city']","Chandigarh, June 26For Manpreet, a 24-year-old residing in the city, life is as bad as it can possibly get.

The students claimed that they were asked to deposit course fee (Rs 16, 875 for 1st semester) for MBA (correspondence) in USOL. We are paying Rs 60,000 for the entire course, which is the fee structure for UIAMS and not USOL, said Raman Vohra, another student. About 100 such students had given representation to earlier Vice-Chancellor and later to the Dean University Instructions, Prof SC Vaidya, on September 9 and again on September 22. Earlier, the university had released an advertisement for an entrance exam, (to be held on June 14) for 500 seats in MBA (off campus) in UIAMS. But only 250 seats could be filled up in the process. Meanwhile, fresh directions from the DEC were issued and the university decided to merge the course in USOL and the students were informed to deposit the fee. Besides, the new advertisement for the vacant seats was released this time for USOL. Subsequently, more seats were filled up making it a total of 400 seats. The UIAMS, director, Prof AK Saihjpal, maintained that the students are being benefited in the entire process, since the introduction of a uniform national policy means more grants for USOL and increased duration for the students to clear their exam. Instead of two years, the students can finish their MBA in five years. This is a major benefit. Out of 400 seats, all the students have deposited the fee except three. The university has taken this decision only after the directions of the MHRD, informed Saihjpal. The DEC has been formed to check the fake correspondence degrees being awarded by many institutes in the country. DEC directed the university to bring all correspondence courses under one umbrella to bring uniformity, he added. Council approves increase of PU law seats Neha Miglani Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 2 After an effort of almost one year, 60 additional seats for BA (Hons), LLB have been approved in the University Institute of Legal Studies, UILS, Panjab University.

In a correspondence to the department on September 30, the council gave a nod to the infrastructure and other resources in the department for increasing the number of seats. The permission has been granted following an inspection by former chairperson of the council to the department NPS Sinha. Its a matter of pride for the university that the council has granted 60 seats. UILS was inspected by the chairperson of the council and the infrastructure, potential, teachers and other facilities have been found up to the mark, said GK Chathrath, Dean (Law faculty). Earlier, when the course started, there were only 80 seats. Later, modification was made and the seats increased to 100 and gradually on implementation of OBC quota, it became 120. The faculty members agreed that the increase in number of seats means that the meritorious students would not be deprived of admission in the institute now. Meanwhile, the department is also a pioneer in introducing the subjects of insurance, law and banking law (already introduced in 1st year) in the curriculum.

Residents said adequate water was not even available on the ground floor and those living on the upper floors faced miserable times. Complaints failed to yield any results as officials concerned said they were helpless because of breakdown in the supply system at Kajauli waterworks. Rajnish Jain, a resident of Mohali, said water was supplied to the area with tankers, but storing water for meeting all the requirements was a big problem. He said even on the ground floor water only trickled over the past two days. Overhead tanks had run dry as there was hardly any water which could be pumped up. The water supplied was even muddy. He said the area had been facing shortage of water over the years. When Balbir Singh Sidhu had come to Phase IX asking for votes before the assembly elections he was told of the water problem that residents faced. He had assured that he would get the problem solved, but nothing had been done so far. Amteshwar Kaur, councillor living in Phase XI, said the pressure of water was very low on the ground floor, which adversely affected even the working of the water filter. Water bottles had been purchased for drinking purposes. Executive engineer of the public health department Inderjit Singh Kang said there was a breakdown at Kajauli waterworks because of which supply had been hit. The UT administration worked hard to get the system functional at the earliest. Supply of water was cut for 15 hours on Wednesday and for 12 hours yesterday, which resulted in shortage. The system had started functioning and the supply would become normal by tomorrow, he added.

Now, the residents have decided not to send their children to schools and start a protest till the problem was solved. Sarpanch Khushiram said there was no water supply in Uttaron, Telon, Badada, Sahalyon, Roog, Bahalyaon, Ghat ka Bagra, Chohad and Chehri for the last one year. It was only on May 7, the day of polling for Lok Sabha elections, when the locals had water supply in their villages, he said. Though many representations were made to the authorities, no step was taken to solve the problem, he said. No one even visited to see the situation, alleged Khushiram. While there was no water supply in the school, children were falling ill due to immense heat following which the residents have decided not to sent their wards to school now onwards, said Hari Singh, a panch. Panchkula Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Yadav, when contacted, said though it was not in his knowledge, he would send the high officials to go on the spot and solve the problem.

A resident of the cooperative society in Sector 50 said even though she stored water in the buckets in the morning, it would not last throughout the day. The water pressure is low and thus, there was almost no water in the washrooms and kitchens.

Those, who have to reach offices are facing a precarious situation due to acute shortage of water. The residents of Sectors 29, 30, 35 and 38 are also facing the same problem for the past three days. When contacted, SE, Public health, R K Goyal, said the water shortage was due to a breakdown at Kajauli water works and the repair work was going on. He said as this line catered to Sector 48 to 53, there was a problem of low pressure of water in the southern sectors. The supply would be streamlined by tomorrow and the department was taking up remedial measures by putting more motors for that area, he added.

Addressing a press conference, association president Sanjiv Sagar said: More than 1,000 tenants entrepreneurs were engaged in manufacture of 50 types of goods and services and had proved their viability. The chances of their success were far greater in comparison with new entrepreneurs, whom the administration seemed to be favouring at the moment. Demanding the prices of these industrial plots to be kept on a par with those of neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana, the association said a place in the third phase should also be reserved for those tenants who were providing allied services like spares retail outlet, document centre.

Amputation of Leg Kin battle for justice even after 6 yrs Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 10 Six years ago, this day, Abhishek Alhuwalias life changed forever. A small injury on his left leg while playing football in school led to amputation, following the alleged medical negligence on part of INSCOL Hospital, Sector 34, where he was taken for treatment. Since then, his family has been fighting for justice. Speaking to The Tribune, distressed Abhisheks mother Anuradha not only feels the pain of her sons suffering but also failure to get justice in the case. She said: Six years on and my sons case is still dragging in the district court. As things stand, I dont know whether we will get justice or not. I am not doing this for publicity. This is my fight for justice. Anuradha said the doctors  Dr Sanjay Saluja and Dr Caplash  whose medical negligence led to amputation had gone to Australia after stay from the High Court. Earlier, the Chandigarh police had booked them under Section 338 of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly causing grievous hurt by an act of endangering life by negligence. She has another appeal pending in the National Consumer Redressal Commission against the orders of UT Consumer Redressal Commission, which dismissed her case for compensation. Recalling the incident, she said there was no need for an amputation as it was only a case of fracture. Even when we took him to hospital soon after the incident, Dr Saluja told us that the child had a small fracture in the upper end of the tibia and dislocation of knee joint that required plastering only. With his condition showing no signs of improvement after a few days, we were told to shift him to GMCH-32, where we were told that he had multiple organ failure. With the result, his left leg had to be amputated on August 1.",{},"['problem', 'shortage', 'tribune', 'service', 'water', 'india', 'supply', 'residents', 'dr', 'youth', 'chandigarh', 'theatre']","The pressure of water is low and the duration of water supply is limited.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,1/8/2010 0:00,,"Decision on Rathores bail plea today Tribune News Service Panchkula, January 7 Additional District and Sessions Judge Sanjeev Jindal today reserved his decision on the anticipatory bail plea of former Haryana DGP SPS Rathore and co-accused Sewa Singh in the Ruchika molestation case for tomorrow. Rathore had moved the court on December 30, seeking anticipatory bail following the registration of two fresh FIRs against him following the complaints of Ruchikas father Subhash Girhtora and his son Ashu. They accused Rathore of attempt to murder, illegal detention and forging of documents. Though another fresh case of abetment to suicide was slapped on Rathore later, he did not file any application for anticipatory bail in it. Earlier, Abha Rathore, pleading for anticipatory bail for her husband, submitted that though the police and the complainants did not have an iota of evidence to prove the allegations levelled in the FIRs against Rathore, he had been wrongly booked due to media hype. The complainants had used the media to mount pressure on the police and the government to register criminal cases against him, she contended. She said the media was portraying Rathore as a monster, molester and an animal and pronouncing its own judgements holding him guilty. She pleaded that her husband, a 67-year-old man who had undergone aortic valve surgery, should be granted anticipatory bail as he was not opposed to any investigation like in the past. Rathore had already been absolved of many charges in the court and he was again being subject to harassment and humiliation, she added, arguing that several allegations were levelled against Rathore for the first time during the past 16 years even though the complainants had got a number of opportunities to reveal everything to the investigating agencies and various courts. The counsel of Sewa Singh told the court that his client handled the investigations in the case for only one day (from October 25 to October 26). He arrested Ashu following the disclosure statement of Sandeep on October 25, 1993, on the orders of SI Prem Dutt and handed over the case to him the next day. Claiming that the media was being given distorted facts by the complainants, he argued that Ashu never complained to anybody during this period that he was involved in false cases and it was only after more than 16 years that he was coming up with such claims. He also denied that Sewa Singh acted on the behest of Rathore. Pankaj Bhardwaj, counsel for the Girhotras and Anand Prakash, contended that the accused should not be granted bail, but should be put behind the bars as he could influence investigations. It was only because of his influence that the FIR in the case was registered after seven years of the incident and that also on the intervention of the court, he stated. He also sought immediate custodial interrogation of Rathore, the then Ambala SP, KP Singh, and the other accused in the case. Rathore masterminded everything and it was not possible to discuss the matter with him over a cup of tea to unearth the truth, he contended. It is the rarest of rare cases where a former CBI official has said Rathore tried to bribe him and even former Haryana DGP, RR Singh, said Rathore threatened him, Bhardwaj added. The public prosecutor sought some time to file the reply when the judge asked him why the state had not collected evidence since the matter came up before the court on January 1.",{},"['tribune', 'court', 'singh', 'complainants', 'following', 'india', 'case', 'sewa', 'media', 'chandigarh', 'rathore', 'anticipatory', 'bail']","Rathore had moved the court on December 30, seeking anticipatory bail following the registration of two fresh FIRs against him following the complaints of Ruchikas father Subhash Girhtora and his son Ashu.

Obviously concerned about the vote bank, Congress Mayor Kamlesh has put a spanner in the Municipal Corporations plans to install water meters in houses of 19,296 consumers in colonies and villages, which are till now paying flat rates. Though the Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) of the corporation had passed this agenda and referred it to the House three months ago, yet, being a policy matter, it is still hanging fire as the Mayor is not allowing it to be tabled in the House for discussion. As per the proposal, which was tabled at the F&CC meeting, the corporation was to install water meters in Mauli Jagran, Vikas Nagar, Indra Colony, EWS houses, rehabilitation colonies, villages and Mani Majra and recover installation charges from consumers in four easy instalments. The total expenditure, likely to be incurred as per the proposal of the department, was approximately Rs 1.5 crore for providing pipe and other material to install the meter. The agenda clearly stated that the corporation had to install water meters in the city according to the memorandum of agreement signed between the Government of India and the Chandigarh Administration in 2006, under JNNURM projects.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,7/7/2002 0:00,,"SEARCH WITHIN Cancer and the religion of love A cheerful heart is good medicine; but a downcast spirit dries up the bones, is an ancient proverb that speaks volumes about the connection between the state of mind and health of the body. It is a perspective comment on the link between health and happiness. The inward happiness of a cheerful heart can give us the strength and courage to endure and to overcome ill health and other adverse personal circumstances. In fact, happiness does not depend upon ones material conditions or circumstances. When conditions become difficult and life becomes hard it is the inner disposition of an individual, his morale and spiritual strength which really matter; for that will determine whether the person will be victorious or sink under the weight of adversity. Pain and sorrow are very much part of existence and as one writer put it: To live is to suffer, to survive is to find meaning in the suffering. The other day, one young paediatrician, who had just taken up a job in a hospital, was shocked to discover during a medical test that she has breast cancer. This writer was at the residence of a senior government official, who had won several awards for distinguished service but now afflicted by cancer. He was bitter and angry against God. I have led a righteous life and done nothing to deserve this, he contended. In the course of writing this piece, I receive another bit of news: The young sister of a neighbour, ailing from the same sickness for a while had died. If only you look around you will see cancer is spreading like an epidemic and it is as dreadful as ever. How does one comfort those who are in such unenviable situations? Human beings are poor comforters, but then how does one help these afflicted ones to face the challenge? Sickness and a serious sickness would inevitably lead to sorrow and anxiety. But it is no use getting angry with God; that is no solution. The Alcoholics Anonymous, an organisation working among alcoholics, makes use of a prayer that is relevant to our subject. It runs thus: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cant change, courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. This is far from resigning to a hopeless situation. It is accepting the suffering gracefully and even using it for a greater appreciation of life and its opportunities. Such suffering in fact turns out to be a motivation for living life to the full. The threat of death plays the role of a teacher, for it goads us into appreciating to the utmost that we have or can do today. Mans deepest need is to love and to be at peace. Living with the knowledge that we are going to die someday means that we may choose to give something to the world. In the process we develop an inner sense of worth that helps us to achieve goals that improve the quality of life. We find ourselves striving to have things work out well for others and ourselves. Dr Bernie S. Siegel, MD, has written a book, Love, Medicine and Miracles, in which he says that a person who believes in a benevolent higher power has a potent reason for hope and hope is physiologic. Faith replaces worry with hope and hope revives and releases healing forces within the body. Norman Cousins in Anatomy of an Illness says his experience of being a counsellor at a medical school revealed that patients were reaching out not just for medical help but for hope to give them the courage to battle their disease. Doctors are not usually inclined to try God in the initial stages of a mans sickness, but might hint at the usefulness of faith when the situation is desperate. Dr Siegel recounts from experience that it is far better to make a connection with the spiritual beliefs of the patient earlier when the job is easier. It is an acknowledged fact in all religions that faith has power to move mountains. Spirituality is the means by which faith building spiritual resources are put to use to speed up recovery. In the 1930s, specialists in psychosomatic medicine began to learn that a host of physical illnesses were caused by envy, jealousy, self-centredness, resentment, hatred and fear. These are negative emotions, which go against the laws laid down by the creator. Each religion prescribes ways of eliminating the evil within: Through meditation and prayer, through repentance and reconciliation, true spirituality has a liberating influence, setting us free from our pride, selfishness, hatred, fear and such other negative qualities, which hold us in bondage perpetually. For living the life abundant, we need to be set free from these dark elements then we are free to love and serve as God intended. I am convinced that the only Hell which exists is the inability to love, observed the famous Russian novelist Dostoyevsky. Such people feel a profound emptiness inside. I feel that all disease is ultimately related to a lack of love or to love that is only conditional, for the exhaustion and depression of the immune system thus created leads to physical vulnerability. I also feel that all healing is related to the ability to give and accept unconditional love, concludes Dr Siegel, giving case histories which demonstrated the wonderful healing power of love.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,10/20/2001 0:00,,"Nostalgic tunes of sand dunes Aditi Tandon Tribune News Service Chandigarh, October 19 The virility of their voices stands in stark contrast to the softness of their being. This softness is further enhanced by the bright rainbow colours which smile at you from the numerous folds of their turbans. Just when you are about to wonder as to where this troupe of revelers belong, a melody typical of the desert says it all. What follows is a literal journey through the heavy sand dunes of Jaisalmer, the kingly grandeur of Jodhpur and the nostalgic hospitality of Barmer, courtesy the musical guides called the Manganiyars. As of today, the list of tribes credits is endless, the brightest being, Nimbooda, the famous song picturised on Aishwarya Rai in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis film, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. In theory, neither the lyrics nor the music of this song have been created in Bollywood. The song has lived in the homes of Manganiyars since ages. They are the real custodians of many folk songs, including Nimbooda. After about four years of absence, six masters of this Rajasthani folk musical heritage, today marked a hearty comeback under the Tribune-sponsored SPIC MACAYs Virasat series. They were accompanied by Rekha, a Jodhpur-based Kalbelia dancer, who amazed the audience with her stunts. To begin with, all of them were overwhelmed to find love and respect brewing in the citys heart, as always. When the strains of melody took off from this warmth, they transcended physical boundaries and transported the gathering at the Chandigarh, College of Architecture to the dusty roads of Barmer, the place of Manganiyars belonging and musical offering. As an inseparable group comprising six musicians, Paipa Khan, Barkat Khan, Chanan Khan, Anwar Khan, Dhewar Khan and Kheta Khan, the Manganiyars are leading a life of absolute devotion. Their music engenders from the soul and merges into the soul after softly touching the surroundings. In the words of singer Anwar Khan, Our music is not inhibited by techniques. It flows freely from our instruments and is passed on to our children as freely. You will find even three-year-olds playing folk instruments in Jaisalmer. From the days of royalty, this Mirasi tribe has covered a vast distance. The Khans have spilled the magic of folk in many foreign countries. Kheta Khan, a ghadtaal player, has worked on theatre projects with Zingaro in France and Brooklyn Academy in the USA. The most celebrated of the Manganiyars, Sakar Khan, boasts of a Presidents Award and Madhya Pradesh Governments Tulsi Samman. Despite all this, even today the Manganiyars, along with Langas, another musician tribe, are patronised by the wealthy Marwaris, who bestow them with camels, horses, cows and jewellery as gifts. Tracing roots from Sindh, now in Pakistan, the group sings of mirth and joy. The themes stem from occasions like birth, marriage and festivals. Talking, about their folk instruments (khamaicha, ghadtaal, shehnai, sindhi sarangi and morchang) the Manganiyars today told Chandigarh Tribune that they were dedicated to the revival of folk arts. Said Paipa Khan, who harmonised the ambience with the vibrations of Sindhi shehnai today, The khamaicha was close to extinction, but we have saved it. Where earlier it was made only in Ahmedabad and in Karachi, we are now making it at Jaisalmer. The sounds that resonated from the khamaicha, played today by Chanan Khan, left a breath of desert in the air. Made of mango wood, goat skin and goat intestines, the instrument is basic to Rajasthani folk music. A solo performance on the khamaicha by Chanan Khan gave way to jugalbandi of three instruments. Divine rhythms filled the surroundings, as Kheta Khan matched the rustic yet soft sounds of the ghadtaal with the beats of the dholak given by Dhewar Khan and soft strains of khamaicha struck by Chanan Khan. The element of spirituality injected by the instrumentalists was carried further by vocalists Anwar Khan and Barkat Khan, who commenced the recital with a birth song. Sung on the birth of a male child, Halario in Raaga Pahari was delightful, so was the instrumental rendition of the welcome song Kesariya baalma aao ni padharo mare des. The singers also presented Nimbooda in their inimitable style, followed by a song in Sindhi. The vocal recital ended with the invocatory Damadam mast kalandar. Interwoven into the melodious schedule was the Kalbelia (cobra dance) of Rajasthan, presented by Rekha. She first picked up beads of a ghungroo and later lifted currency notes with her eyes.",{},"['chanan', 'khan', 'tribune', 'today', 'india', 'manganiyars', 'khamaicha', 'song', 'music', 'instruments', 'sindhi', 'chandigarh', 'folk']","As an inseparable group comprising six musicians, Paipa Khan, Barkat Khan, Chanan Khan, Anwar Khan, Dhewar Khan and Kheta Khan, the Manganiyars are leading a life of absolute devotion.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,5/4/2001 0:00,,"Sinha attacks prophets of doom Hopes 6 pc GDP growth will be maintained New Delhi, May 3 Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha today made a frontal attack on the prophets of doom who were forecasting a slowdown of the Indian economy and asserted that a growth rate of over 6 per cent growth will be maintained this year. Others (countries) are confident, the world is confident, but we are not confident Sinha remarked when asked whether India will sustain its growth rate in the face of the slowdown of the US economy. He did not anticipate any serious impact on the Indian economy due to the US slowdown, Sinha told reporters on his return here from the USA after attending the annual Fund-Bank meeting. Noting that the USAs annualised growth rate had stood at 2 per cent instead of an abysmal 1 per cent forecast, Sinha said this would have very minimal impact on the Indian economy. It was regrettable, he said, that while people abroad were very buoyant about the Indian economy, the same did not hold good within the country where certain quarters remained pessimistic about the economic outlook for India. Sinha declined to comment on the US decision to put India on the watchlist under Super 301, saying it was for the Commerce Ministry to react. The US government had on Tuesday announced it was placing India, EU, Japan and some other countries on the watchlist of Super 301 and Special 301 provisions of its trade law for imposing unfair trade barriers on Amercian products or for violation of intellectual property rights. On the prospects of a new round of negotiations at the WTO, Sinha said India had already stated at Seattle and elswhere that it was opposed to entry into the trade round of any issue which is a non-trade issue and which is going to create new non-tariff barriers. Nobody in India or abroad be in any doubt about Indias position. We have talked about implementational issues which have to be tackled before we go into the new round. All that is Indias stated position, Sinha said on the sidelines of a FICCI meeting here. The trend that I got in meetings in Washington and New York was that the developed countries are losing sympathy, and there is already a clear division among their ranks on the various issues, he said. For instance, he said, some issues that might be of very great importance to the US may not find support from the European Union. Similarly, the issue that could be of great importance to the EU may not find support in the USA or those of importance to Japan may not find backing from the USA and the European Union. This is clearly perceptible that they (developed nations) will not be able to talk in one voice and therefore if developing countries put their act together and talk in one voice they have a great chance if and when the next round is held. If a new round of (WTO negotiations) is in the interest of India and other developing countries, we are not opposed to it, Sinha said adding that there is no point in having a new round which is going to fail like in Seattle. That is going to be very, very bad for international trade. Sinha also did not comment on the lifting of the remaining sanctions by the USA and merely said Washington has to move into action, and that it calls for legislative action. The Finance Minister also refused to hazard a guess on the timeframe for such an action. On interest rate cut, Sinha said it was for the Reserve Bank of India to decide.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,10/20/2001 0:00,,"OPINION When terrorists hijack a religion A study in historical perspective Syed Nooruzzaman T ODAY even youngsters feel disturbed because of the actions of certain people swearing by Islam. They want to know if Islam really promotes violence. The uncomfortable question was put to Harvard- and-Oxford-educated Benazir Bhutto, former Prime Minister of Pakistan, the other day by students of American University in Washington. She, however, preferred to avoid answering the question directly perhaps because of being a person with a guilty conscience. After all, she is one of the Pakistani rulers who have promoted terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir in the name of religion. She represents one section of the people who have done everything possible to give a bad name to Islam, which celebrated playwright George Bernard Shaw praised so profusely. There are other equally disturbing questions being raised these days. Has Islam come in the way of its followers from excelling in different areas of human activity? Has it prevented the growth of democracy where its followers are in command? Does it promote a civilisation which is against modern ideas? All these and other such thoughts are based mainly on ignorance or on a distorted picture presented by interested circles. If Islam had been against progress, its followers would not have contributed immensely to the growth of different branches of knowledge when it was on the ascendant. How can the world ignore the contribution of Abu Ali al-Husain-al-Sina or Avicenna (980-1037 AD), the great physician, philosopher and physicist, who wrote a unique medical encyclopedia (Qanun-Fil-Tib or Canon in Latin)? Probably no medical work ever written has been so much studied...Hence his influence on European medicine has been overwhelming, according to a celebrated western writer and quoted in Heritage of Islam by Khwaja Jamil Ahmad, who worked as an Assistant Editor, Daily Star, Allahabad, before India was partitioned. Who invented the telescope, the pendulum and the first watch? They were the practitioners of Islam but different from those who waste their talent and resources in destructive activities today. At a time when the watch was an object of wonder in Europe, Khlifa Harun Ar-Rashid presented this novel machine made by Kutbi to the then French Emperor Charlemagne. Mathematician Al-Khwarizimi, the author of Hisab Al-Jabr Wal Muqabla, is regarded as one of the founders of what the world knows as algebra. Spain was ruled by the followers of Islam when it sowed the seeds of the industrial revolution in Europe. Even today we have a few stars shining here and there. The list is endless. The purpose behind recounting all this is to make it clear that people are engaged in profitable pursuits when not used as pawns in big games by powerful nations of the world. What BJP senior leader K. R. Malkani has said in a recent article in a Delhi-based newspaper is worth mentioning here though it is not directly related to development: After the Buddha, Vikrama and Shankara in India, Kung Fu-tse, Shih Huang Ti and Lao-tzu in China, and Plato, Socrates and Aristotle in Greece, it was Islam that dominated much of the world in the Middle Ages. Three hundred years ago, the three biggest empires in the world, based in India, Persia (todays Iran) and Turkey, were Muslim. Even China and Russia were ruled by Mongol Khans. Before King John of England signed the Magna Carta with his recalcitrant nobles, he had sought the support of the Sultan of Morocco, and had even offered to embrace Islam in the bargain. Islam finds itself in the dock mainly because of the doings of three kinds of players on the world stage. And their actions are interlinked. All of them have prevented the people from channelling their energies towards constructive causes. The first are the products of the substandard madarsas who lack the vision to guide the community properly. They continue to influence the actions of large sections of the masses in the absence of enlightened community leaders and adequately educated religious scholars and owing to some other factors. They are the Taliban variety. The second category comprises the people who control the levers of power in Muslim-majority countries. Most of them are heads of totalitarian regimes, with a few exceptions. These rulers are either monarchs or former members of armed forces. They have ruthlessly suppressed any movement to bring about a change in the political dispensation in their respective countries. Since the people there are mostly believers in Islam, their movements for a representative form of government have been obviously inspired by their religion. But unfortunately all such attempts made so far have failed because the democratic West, the USA included, has sided with dictators. Powerful western democracies constitute the third force coming in the way of the people wishing to contribute to socio-economic, political and scientific development. See the plight of Afghanistan. It was a peaceful country till the Soviet Union directly intervened in its affairs by installing a pro-Moscow regime. The unhappy development pushed Afghanistan into the politics of sphere of influence played by the then superpowers. The big game has not ended with the eclipse of the communist giant. Only the games complexion has changed. The sufferers are the innocent Afghans and the religion they profess. Now the situation has taken a turn for the worse. The West, which swears by democracy at every available occasion, has, in its blind pursuit of the elusive terrorist, created an atmosphere which suits those bent on eliminating anybody seeking change for the better. The pro-changers can be eliminated easily by describing them as traitors of saboteurs and the world outside will sympathise with the killers. What a tragic scenario! The worlds most wanted terrorist Osama bin Laden, and his associates are, of course, more to blame than anyone else for this sad state of affairs. But the western friends of the dictators are equally guilty. Take the case of Pakistan. The greatest advocate of democracy, the USA, is most probably going to stall the democatic process which should have begun in Pakistan by now in accordance with a directive of the countrys Supreme Court. The prevailing conditions provide an excellent pretext. Military ruler Pervez Musharraf will be the gainer at the cost of democracy, but that is not the Americans problem. Over nine years ago (1992) one of the political parties in Algeria appeared to be successful in capturing power through the democratic process. But before it could form its government, the French intervened on some flimsy pretext and the whole process was rendered redundant. The military-run French-friendly regime which was to have been replaced by a peoples government was back in business. The reason: the French realised that their interests in their former colony would be jeopardised once the victorious party was allowed to control the levers of power. The victim was the Islamic Salvation Front (popularly known as the FIS, the abbreviation of its name in French) despite the fact that the voters had reposed confidence in its ability to protect their interests. What followed was a horrifying wave of killings, resulting in the loss of nearly one lakh lives. It is true, as certain thinkers point out, that a democratic environment in the Muslim-majority countries could have prevented the disgruntled elements from taking to the destructive path. Or those with a perverted mind  the terrorists  would have had no appeal among the masses. But perhaps this does not suit the western powers so long as there is a guarantee for their economic and strategic interests remaining safe. One fails to understand how the world can successfully fight a war against terrorism when the ground for its growth remains fertile. The cause of democracy must get precedence over all other issues, of course, without jeopardising the peoples economic interests, to take the anti-terrorism campaign to its logical conclusion. The worlds independent and respected think-tanks should come out with fresh ideas to convince the aggrieved that terrorism can never help find a way out of a crisis situation. They should, at the same time, give a broad definition of the scourge and new policy formulations so that development-related issues become attractive for everybody in every corner of the globe. This is possible only in a world free from suppression or where people are encouraged to express their grievances, and governments view such developments in a positive manner. Totalitarian regimes of any hue can find no place in this scheme of things.",{},"['terrorism', 'democracy', 'tribune', 'islam', 'followers', 'religion', 'india', 'world', 'way', 'western', 'interests', 'chandigarh', 'french']","Has Islam come in the way of its followers from excelling in different areas of human activity?

Under the bylaws, any contractor having manpower of more than 10 employees is required to provide one toilet for 10 persons and separate toilets for men and women. The Medical Officer today inspected the Industrial Area, including Mani Majra, and directed all sanitary inspectors to inspect the construction sites of the contractors in their respective areas and initiate action if any violation was found.  TNS Rejected candidates resent goof-up Tribune News Service Panchkula, February 13 Braving inclement weather, candidates who had applied for the post of Hindi translators, today protested outside the office of the Haryana Staff Selection Commission in Sector 2 here after they were turned away on grounds of ""ineligibility"". The Secretary of the Board, Mr P. D. Verma, however, said that most of them did not fulfil the condition laid down for the post. ""Despite the varied qualifications, we are holding interviews for some candidates. The Chairman has said that while we can go ahead with the interviews, a final nod with be given to the selections only after a clarification has been sought from the department concerned,"" he said. Mr Verma explained that they would have to verify the qualifications of the candidates as sought in the advertisement. The candidates, however, made no bones about the casual approach of officers dealing with them. ""We travelled from all over Haryana to be here in such cold only to be rejected by the board. They should have told us in advance about our eligibility,"" said Ramesh Chander, a resident of Jind. Interestingly, the board had sent interview letters to all candidates without the scrutiny of forms. ""We had mentioned our qualifications in the form. If we were not eligible, we should not have got these call letters at all,"" said Satinder Garg from Sirsa. The board seems to have goofed up with call letters sent to all without any scrutiny of forms. The fate of the candidates is decided on the spot which is not only inconvenient but also harrowing for the candidates. ""We invite applications without any documents. We agree that there has been carelessness on the part of the scrutiny officer but its a policy matter. Usually, there are only a handful of ineligible candidates unlike today when their number exceeds those eligible,"" an official said. The candidates, however, were unwilling to take no. With six- month-old baby in her lap, Nisha Rangara from Sirsa, could not curse the officials enough for forcing her to come all the way to Panchkula and then, shutting the doors on her. There were other women candidates who came with their babies only to go back dejected. Amita Shah from Pinjore, Kavita Gupta from Panchkula, joined the men to raise slogans against the board and its officials in the open, outside the office, as the rain drenched them. Water leakage in Raj Bhavan Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 13 At least, 20 complaints of leakages in government buildings following rain in the past two days has been received by the UT Engineering Departments. Water leakages from Punjab Raj Bhavan, dinning room of the Chief Justice in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the District Courts and the Central State Library have been received, said sources. Shopkeepers observe bandh Claim losses due to closure of market entry points Tribune News Service Panchkula, February 13 A complete bandh was observed in the Sector 7 market on a call by the Market Welfare Association even as irked shopkeepers blocked traffic for an hour and opened the entry points recently closed by the police in the name of streamlining traffic, here today. In response to the protest, the Deputy Commissioner, Ms Neerja Shekhar, said that a committee to look into the whole scheme to close entry points would be formed. This will comprise people from the business fraternity and also from the Residents Welfare Associations of the city. While the number of accidents has come down due to closure of multiple entry points, we will reconsider these in the light of the objections, she said. Meanwhile, all shops in the market remained closed in protest against the indifferent attitude of the police towards the losses incurred by the business community due to closure of sector entry points. The shopkeepers held a demonstration on the Sector 7 and 8 dividing road hoping to elicit a reaction from the administration. Raising slogans against the police and officials of the district administration, the shopkeepers parked their vehicles at the disputed crossing to block traffic for over an hour. While traffic on the road came to a grinding halt, no policeman reached the spot to take charge of the situation as chaos ruled. School buses were stranded or took wrong turns as did other motorists to circumvent the blockade of the shopkeepers. Agitated with the attitude of the police over business losses suffered following the closure of the crossings, they went on to uproot tiles of the divider. After removing all the tiles which were cemented together to block the entry to Sector 7, the shopkeepers raised another round of slogans at the spot. It was then that the Deputy Chief Minister, Mr Chander Mohan, staying just across the road, stepped out to placate the businessmen. He assured them that there interests would be taken into consideration before taking any decisions and asked a delegation of the shopkeepers to meet the Deputy Commissioner. It was only when the Deputy CM had settled the issue that the SHO of the Sector 5 police station came on the scene and stood like a mute spectator.",{},"['tribune', 'shopkeepers', 'sector', 'service', 'india', 'ut', 'entry', 'road', 'board', 'chandigarh', 'today', 'candidates']","UT all set to release new excise policyTribune News Service Chandigarh, January 13After seeking legal opinion, the Chandigarh Administration is all set to release the Excise Policy for 2007-2008.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,1/31/2013 0:00,,"A century of running! Gurvinder Singh Wrinkled skin, drooping eyes, unkempt turban, he is just another old man on the street, until he puts on his shoes, that track suit and he is ready to go! He is a youth icon in his own right. I dont consider myself old. I still feel the zeal to do anything, he says during his visit at Arya College, Ludhiana. Fauja Singh is every bit a man of grit and courage, which is testified through his rise and the legendary journey that has made him a noteworthy figure throughout the world. Once you have decided to achieve a target, just go on until you achieve it, he says. I just decide that I have to complete the distance, and it doesnt matter even if I lose my life doing that, he says. During his marathons, first half doesnt cause too much exhaustion. But when the going gets tough for a few kilometers, he recites Gods name, he shares with us. When most of the old become effete and rely on medicines, the 101-year-old doesnt take any medicine. Prevention is better than cure, he says. During old age, one must abstain from things that cause cold or constipation, he says. Not eating is better than eating wrong things in this age, he adds. He takes pinni made with flax seeds throughout the year in the morning. He takes a chapati twice; likes masur and moth dals. He loves Punjab and feels that drugs have become a blot on Punjab. It hurts that the image of Punjab has become tarnished because of the menace of drugs, he says. The youngsters must stop their peers who might be destroying their lives, rather than ignoring them, he says. Fauja Singh is still eager to learn at this age. Social calling First-time director Ajay Saklanis film has received a rousing response Mona Upaasmar: The Taste of Hunger is a film that highlights the unfortunate deaths of children in Melghat, Maharashtra. And the director of the movie Ajay Saklani hails from a small village in Mandi District, Himachal Pradesh. He always dreamt of making films and this one is a dream start. A wanderer who kept changing cities for education and then work, Ajay came across Melghat, a cluster of 370 villages in the Satpura wilderness in Maharashtra in 2009. The tribals live in abject poverty out there, without basic amenities. Thousands of children lose their lives to hunger. Ajay, while on a teaching job in Maharashtra, worked on his weekends on the film. ""In the last three decades, Melghat region has seen electricity only thrice, that too when prominent politicians visited the area,"" says Ajay. The film took two years to complete and Ajay had to give up his teaching job in order to continue making it and work in the area simultaneously. His film, which has been shown in almost all medical colleges in Maharashtra, has received a rousing response. ""Not only have we got funds, but also volunteers for Melghat,"" he shares. The film was screened at the Chandigarh Creative Cinema Circles event on Sunday at Lajpat Rai Bhawan-15. Ajay continues to finance his films; his next is Life Beyond Hills that documents the life of people who have to trek days together to reach their villages. ""It charts the journey of gaddis,"" he says. It is Satyajit Ray and Shyam Benegals work that he watches; and its his father who inspires Ajay the most. Izzatnagar Ki Asabhya Betiyan and Agaurav were the other two films by Nakul Sawhney that were screened during the event. Future Shock On the face value Nishtha Anand Shukla No, this is not what is expected of the Facebook Graph Search. I have been trying the new search product from our favourite social networking site and I am not impressed. In a highly speculated event, Facebook launched its Graph Search facility, which has been in Beta stage the last two weeks. However, most of the reviews pouring in have numerous reservations and fears. After Facebook gave me access to this fascinating new feature, I got down to trying it this week. And as I said, it failed to meet my expectations. Not smart enough When a brand like Facebook launches a product in the face of falling stock prices, you expect to see something that would take us by storm. To start with, I expected it to be smarter than what it is right now. It shows results that are well expected. It often does not limit results to within my circle and there are a lot of privacy issues that the company will have to soon look into. Results and more True, it allows you to look up people, places and things. So, I started out looking for My friends who listen to David Guetta. It gave me standard results based on the information on friend profiles, something that numerous other social networking sites have been providing in various forms. With search results it showed me a sidebar where I can further filter results based on age, gender, occupation, city, school, friendship and likes. You can filter these results based on practically everything that is available on someones profile. Again, no applaud for this feat. Some social and professional networking sites have been offering filtered results for a long time now. Now, while these are generic results that I could be looking for, specific results more often than not fail to yield results. While a search for My friends who like Disneyland gave me results, My friends who have gone to Disneyland did not give any results. Well, that latter would have been helped me better by seeking reviews if I was planning a trip there. A travel reviews website gives me better results in terms of places. No, Graph Search is not a replacement for web-based searches. For searches that are not available on Facebook, it generates results on Bing. Thats as far as it can get. Privacy issues In a press conference recently, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg reinstated belief in protecting the privacy of their users. The public announcement from Facebook said that you can only search for content that has been shared with you. However, when I looked up people who have been to say, a restaurant, it gave me pictures of people I have never known. This put out serious questions on the privacy policies that Facebook is following in practice. Good for the stalkers At the end of this confusing story comes this one thing that might interest you. If you are fond of looking up pictures pictures of friends, pictures of friends friends, pictures of ex-boyfriends and pictures of ex-crushes, then this search will give you some interesting results. While most results I tried showed results that were few and far between, search for Pictures of my friends taken in Goa, India gave me close to a 100 results. I can vouch that this number is lesser than what I have seen on my Facebook timeline. So how exactly is Facebook managing its results? Solving that will take the Beta time some time, as will we knowing it. (Shukla is a technology expert) Natures melody Artist Anu Ganjus canvases offer a colourful interpretation of nature Amarjot Kaur The gallantry of art lies not in the audacity with which it beautifies the most ostentatious realms of intellect, rather it manifests deep within the shades of all possible colours of nature. Inspired by the same ideation, Anu Ganju, Gurgaon-based artist exhibits a host of paintings at IFMs Art Portfolio, Sector 9. The exhibition was inaugurated by Vijai Vardhan, IAS, Chairman Haryana Tourism Corporation. It showcases as many as 20 paintings that are hung rather deftly around the walls of the gallery. The ambiance, the music and the paintings are perfectly in tune with the standards of utter refinement that is much characterised by the Marxists bourgeois. Hold your ground, sip on a glass of soda and throw a tender glance at the paintings, its a riot of colours, a rather too many, a little too much, yet beautiful in their own sweet way. Though most of the paintings are oil on canvas, there are others that break the monotony with water colour and acrylic and mix media. ""This is my third exhibition in the city and I am delighted to see how the town has taken a liking to art in the last few years. I am an architect by profession. However, I choose to suit myself with painting because its my passion,"" shares Anu, while exchanging an interesting banter, ""You see, I have never had any formal training in painting and as a self-trained artist I paint straight from my heart."" Needless to say, her paintings, especially Twitter, In the Rain, Outsider, My Red Parasol and Aquarius reflect her love for nature and her understanding of it. ""My most recent work is the one on that wall,"" she says, while pointing towards a huge painting that was titled By the Sea, ""I am an impressionist, the smallest of things intrigue me and I just sit down to paint. Youd wonder, but sometimes when I intend to paint something, it translates into an entirely different product during the course of its making. At times, even I dont know what the final painting would look like,"" she quips. Her paintings have been bought by the Taj Palace in Mumbai and they continue to adorn the walls of the fine Indian dining restaurant there. ""Many foreigners who visit my exhibition buy a lot of paintings,"" says she. The show goes on, the visitors keep pouring as the sun melts down and we pick a few greens to match the cerulean shade of the day. On till February 8 green thumb Sweet & sour satish narula When a gardener plans a home garden, there are many preferences that are considered by the family and those likes and dislikes when executed make it every members garden. But there are a few plants that are must haves in a garden. One of these is lemon which, whether it is winter or summer, is of day-to-day requirement. At times, this fruit is so costly in the market that one avoids buying it. Lemon is one of the most docile garden pets. It grows without any fuss and grows almost wild in the gardens in the sub-mountainous region and adjoining areas like Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Chandigarh, Fatehgarh, Patiala, Ambala and Yamunanagar. These are the areas where lime is a failure due to diseases. As it is a rich source of Vitamin C, and natures one of the biggest boons, a regular intake of which could help ward off diseases and give the body immunity. It is all the more important for those who do sedentary work as lemon water with a pinch of salt makes up for bodily liquid losses. Lemon starts bearing fruit in the third year of planting. Some gardeners had complained that when they bought lemon plant from some nursery, it was already in bearing but after that fruit finished, there was no fruit for a few years. Well, it is due to the fact that the plant was propagated from the twig that already had that factor responsible for flowering and fruiting. But once planted in the ground, it reverts back to its juvenile phase and puts forth the required vegetative growth before it starts bearing fruit. So there is no worry for cause in case you are passing through that phase. While planting lemon tree, one should get only a recommended variety that is available with the nurseries of Punjab Agricultural University or State Directorate of Horticulture. However, since it is vegetatively propagated, one will get a true to type plant if the plant was prepared from any good mother plant. Propagation is also very easy. It is done by way of air layering, commonly called gooti. Almost every mali knows about this method. One of the main problems that confront the gardeners who have planted lemons is the rupturing of fruit with the onset of rains. Keep watering the plant regularly, twice a week.

New kid on the block After appearing in several commercials, model Rahul Kohli makes his debut as an actor with a cross-over between UK and India. He recently completed the shooting and is now looking forward to the release. We catch up with the talented newcomer to talk about the film, his Punjabi roots and the journey so far Tell us about your background. I was brought up in Delhi and then in Australia. Showbiz always attracted me since childhood, but as per any Indian family I was asked to focus on studies. I did reasonably well in studies but I also kept doing modeling for prints, TVCs and music albums in Delhi during my college days. It was my first taste of real showbiz. After completing my BSc from Delhi University, I completed my masters in Business IT and Master in Commerce from Royal Melbourne institute of technology (RMIT University). My education enabled me for permanent residency in Australia under Highly skilled migration programme. I took on the option and started working in Australia as a business analyst. How did acting happen to you? I started learning acting during one of my long visit to India; this is when I enrolled for a full time diploma course with reputed acting teacher Barry John. This opened up the whole new avenue for me. I came back to Australia enrolled in Victorian college of Arts (Part of University of Melbourne) for their evening acting classes. I also kept doing theatre and roles in films made in Australia and India whenever I got a chance and later I finally decided to pursue acting in Mumbai professionally. Tell us about your film and your character. Tentative name of the film is I am the King. Its a UK-Indian cross over film on the lines of Bend it like Beckham. Its a youth centric entertainer that focuses on a journey of a young boy from UK and how he finds his roots in Punjab. I play second lead in the film and have a very interesting character name Harinder Singh Thind aka Harry. He is one of the boys who always dreams of going to UK and becoming an NRI. He is so focused on his goal that while living in Punjab he presents himself and behave like an NRI, he is sometimes clumsy and funny but also has a serious back story of his own that justifies his actions. Half the film is shot in Punjab and the other half will be shot in UK, most of our shooting was in and around Jalandhar and Amritsar. Being a Punjabi myself I felt proud shooting in Punjab and eating tasty food, I also loved the hospitality of locals and their strength of character, as we all know history is that Punjab has always stood first to defend our country against foreign invasions. How was it working with Puneet Issar? Puneet Issar is a charismatic personality. Working with him was superb. His ability to multitask amazed me. I believe he worked the most number of hours in a day probably 16-20 hours every day. Tough I still dont understand how he manages to do it and still stay vibrant. Aamir supports another cause Aamir Khan is a social crusader. He has brought into forefront many social evils prevailing in the modern Indian society and fought against social stigmas in the society through his show, Satyamev Jayate. Now, he has taken another most important issue in his hand to deal with. He lent his supports to the fight against alcoholism amongst women. He addressed a press conference by Alcoholics Anonymous, an NGO. Aamir says the problem is more complex in India as women never come out and admit that they drink. ""In India, the problem is more complex. There are so many issues that women would be afraid to even admit openly that they are drinking,"" the 47-year-old says. ""So, the fact that you (female reporters) have come here, will give them a lot of strength, lot of courage and with the media reporting about it, the message that it is a disease will come across. Even if you are a woman and if you are suffering, you need to step out and there is help available to you,"" he adds. Aamir says eradicating the issue will be a continuous struggle and one has to be committed to take the struggle forward.

A part of Nach Baliye along with his wife Mahii Vij, he talks about his shows and much more. You made a flying start with Kayamath, but you didnt do many shows after that. Why? Television serials demand a lot of commitment and I like to do shows that are creatively satisfying. The role, the story and everything has to work for me. I cant just do a television serial to keep myself busy or make money. I would rather host a reality show. You were part of Kairi recently, but didnt stay on for too long. Why? When I signed on for Kairi, the story and my character seemed exciting. However, when the show went on air and developed, I felt a sudden disconnect with my character. So, instead of going on without much enthusiasm, I thought it was best that I quit. The makers and I were both on the same page and mutually parted. After hosting, why participate in a reality show Nach Baliye? I am doing Nach Baliye 5 only for Mahi, who convinced me for taking it up. Dancing is fun and I am enjoying it even more with Mahi. Recently on the show, Sajid Khan said you guys had a great chance of winning. What do you think? Well, I am thankful for all the good wishes, love and support. I hope we win too.

Playing on Jallianwallah Gayatri Rajwade It is a surreal sense of Rang De Basanti being revisited! Here are two girls, one an Indian, born and brought up in the UK (her grandfather moved ages ago from village Uggi near Nakodar district in Jullandar) and the other a true-blue Brit, who are in India on a research quest to gather information on the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre of April 13, 1919 for a radio play for BBC Radio in England. Best of Bonsai The city can boast of a large number of dedicated Bonsai artists and Gayatri Rajwade looks into the beauty of their art A living art inspired by nature and imbued with the spirit of trees, fashioned in miniature. While all Gods creatures wither with age, Bonsai is the essence of longevity, for it flowers, bears fruits and continues to give joy year after year, budding towards perfection. Best of Bonsai The city can boast of a large number of dedicated Bonsai artists and Gayatri Rajwade looks into the beauty of their art MINIATURE TREES: Rupan Deol Bajaj with her gnarled tree and prized bonsais.  Photos by A.J. Philip and Pradeep Tewari A living art inspired by nature and imbued with the spirit of trees, fashioned in miniature. While all Gods creatures wither with age, Bonsai is the essence of longevity, for it flowers, bears fruits and continues to give joy year after year, budding towards perfection. Not all bonsais have to be very old says Anil Kaushik, President of the Bonsai Club (India). Relatively young plants by careful training, employing certain techniques and regular maintenance can become authentic and attractive bonsai. But the tree and the container should give the illusion of a mature tree in nature and together must constitute a work of art. As a representation of a great old tree, Bonsai is as precious as a piece of art or a celebrated symphonyspeak to any aficionado and the enchantment spills over. Indian roots One theory traces the origin of the Bonsai to India. Ancient Ayurvedic physicians carried back shoots from medicinal trees from the Himalayas and grew them in miniature forms in pots by trimming and cutting the roots, the tulsi being a good example of this. According to literary sources in the 12th century, it was known as Vamanatanu Vrikshadi Vidya which translates as the science of developing trees in miniature form. Art of the matter In the blossoming, grassy backyard garden of her Sector 16 home, feisty Rupan Deol Bajajs Bonsai trees are peppered in all directions. Art married to horticulture is how this spirited lady describes it. Her Bonsai trees won the first prize at the citys annual Rose Festival held earlier this year and one of her Bonsai has also been featured in the top 100 selections from around the world. I have never studied botany, but in my pursuit to know about Bonsai, I have mulled over types of soils, arboriculture, plant diseases, nutrition, fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides, she declares. Her trees are natural and are gathered from hacked hedges, the lush growth around the city and even from walls of peoples homes! I always carry cement with me for once I have removed the tree along with its roots entwined around the bricks I put the cement in to cover the gap. Another one pulled out of a hedge in 1989 has taken almost 25 years to grow its lush canopy. What delights me is that these are shapes that nature has bestowed. We dont really need to do much to change them; just help them to grow in the right proportion is enough. And with time comes the refined elegance these trees are associated with. I feel age is beautiful because of them. I just wish I had started earlier. Patience & dedication So what is necessary to start? Patience, dedication and time because you can pick up creativity as you go along, states Mrs N. Jaspal, bonsai enthusiast, living in Sector 27. The challenge, according to her, is to keep these trees small and pretty and most importantly make them look like trees. Bonsai trees need lots of sun and very little mud, so her beautifully manicured lawn has her carefully cultivated collection of pilkhans, junipers, bougainvillea, peepul bonsai, among others, to catch the morning sun! I love doing this, in fact I love anything artistic, even plants inspire me, she smiles. The best bonsai will become a jungle if you dont trim it, is her parting shot. And the city is stirring to this inspired art form. It has been 12 years since The Bonsai Club was founded by Kaushik in 1999 in Chandigarh with the active support of late Dr J S Sarkaria and five other experts. Kaushik himself fell spellbound under the magic of the Bonsai at a show in Delhi in 1993. I started reading books, collecting the kit and it took me five years to learn this wonderful art. Today 20 to 30 groups of Bonsai club members learn and help and socialise, keeping the momentum of this art going. With 300 to 400 trees under training and 20 to 25 almost ready, Kaushiks collection has been carefully nurtured since 1997. It is like caring for a child from infant to adulthood. He is also writing a comprehensive book, Bonsai, the living art, to be published soon. Nature Perfect Gayatri Rajwade There is no painting in the world as perfect or complete as nature, he muses and his work, suffused with the quintessence of nature, is an expressive verse to its vast splendour. Not just nature, even ancient temple structures find eloquence in his ability. For his art is all about finding that elusive dhun, that song within the heart that can be hummed forever, that his father speaks about. Son of renowned artist Aziz, Khaleels works are opulent canvases of trees, craggy rocks, flowing waters against a panoramic view of vividly hued skies, etched in refined detail displaying remarkable depth and clarity. This artist-in-residence in the city has been working hard and quietly for the last seven months and has built up a celebrated body of work in Chandigarh, to call his own, far away from his home in Hyderabad. A mural for Gen. S. F. Rodriques (retd) (who saw his work in Hyderabad and asked him to do one for the Governor House in Chandigarh), one at the UT Guesthouse, Sector 6, and several smaller pieces for Ms Jean Rodrigues make up the distinguished list in the city so far. This apart from his work scattered across the country. Khaleel is full of admiration for the Generals highly tuned sense of art. I never used life forms in my works but the General asked to me to add birds and to theme my work on the Shivalik Range. Khaleel studied the ducks at the lake, the great big banyan trees around the city, the rocks and the foliage, finally making the 10x5 foot painting. Even his large canvas at the UT Guesthouse is like looking out of a window at a picturesque view. What makes Khaleels work stand out is the art in relief, made from mixing zinc oxide with marble powder with fierce attention to detail. He pulls out hundreds of photographs of trees, flowers, natural scenery even temples (these are some of his exceptional works too that have even won him an award) that he has taken to get the texture right, a consistency which is attained using a knife to carve out the little niches on the relief. The completed work is then painted over in oils and profundity of the three-dimensional effect comes into force in the play between light and shade. It is arduous work and Khaleel sits in front of his canvas for 16 to 18 hours a day, working on this technique that he has honed in on, watching his father develop it. (Azizs horses using this form have earned him critical acclaim worldwide.) Art was a bygone conclusion for Khaleel. With both parents seeped in artistic endeavours (his mother makes wall-hanging carpets) all seven siblings, including him dabble in arty professions ranging from fashion designing to photography to playing the sitar to Rajasthani figurative paintings!), creativity was the very air he breathed! We were never forced to study but our father always insisted on us drawing and sketching. He said everything lay in observation, in following nature. Khaleel spent his childhood biking around Hyderabad, making sketches, all inspired by nature. It is no wonder then that his first solo exhibition of 23 paintings in 2002 in Hyderabad put on view his enchantment with the stark rocky landscape of the Deccan Plateau, an exhibition inaugurated by then Governor of Andhra Pradesh Dr C. Rangarajan. But all the plaudits skim over him. I still have to learn so much. When I see my fathers work, so perfect and powerful, I feel humbled. If someone says he has learnt it all, he is forgetting his work. Till then he wants to keep working, canvas on the floor, kneeling in front of it, searching for that perfect tune. Power pack Anandita Gupta The sunbeams of success bounce off their glowing faces and begin frolicking in their proud eyes. Fully drenched with their dreamsthat are now living and breathing, these are the three city-girls who have every reason to smile. For, they may not have been born with the proverbial silver spoons in their mouths, but theyve definitely carved out some gold trimmings for themselves. A powerful pack of twenty-somethings, these young ladies have already stepped on the higher rungs of the lucrative corporate ladder. Heres an introduction that youd wish was yourstoppers throughout, graduation from PEC, a stint with the prestigious IIT, Delhi and yes, specialisation from IIM, Bangalore. And as if it was not enough, bombastic job offers from international biggies. Well, the introduction belongs to the three city-girlsAarushi Nehra, Nidhi Bansal and Nidhi Gupta. Having recently returned from IIM Bangalore, after grabbing handsome-pay-packet-paying jobs, the three are already fantasizing heady days of big salaries. Were no reclusive geeky technocrats, the three chorus, enjoying quite a chuckle. At IIMs, we were into all kind of extra-curricular activitiesdramatics, sports, talks, art and what not. Yes, our courses are very compressed and there was a lot of pressure to perform. But, we had fun too. After all, we were doing what we loved the most, they add. And how about brain drainthat much lamented loss of skilled intellectuals to more favourable professional environments? Chirps Nidhi Bansal, While at IIM, I was offered this summer training with HSBC, London for 2 months. But they were so happy with my performance that they gave me a pre-placement offer. The package involves some hefty lakhs per annum, but thats not why Im keen on it. Its the exposure of working in an international environment that I crave for. Adds Nidhi Gupta, Ive been appointed by Deutsche Post Consult, a German company based at US, Singapore and Germany. Im quite thrilled about the offer as it means tremendous exposure. But ultimately, I wanna settle here, in my homeland. Agrees Aarushi, Ive accepted an offer by BNP Paribas, a French bank based at amchi Mumbai. All my family has IIM professionals but we all vouched for Indian offers. Cheers to these three spunky young women whore fuelled by integrity, passion and accomplishment. All three love Chandigarh for its lush lawns, excellent infrastructure and intellectual stimulation. And the city loves them too. For, they are among the aces in the citys power pack. Playing on Jallianwallah Gayatri Rajwade Look back in pride: Rupinderjit & Annalisa  Photo by Parvesh Chauhan It is a surreal sense of Rang De Basanti being revisited! Here are two girls, one an Indian, born and brought up in the UK (her grandfather moved ages ago from village Uggi near Nakodar district in Jullandar) and the other a true-blue Brit, who are in India on a research quest to gather information on the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre of April 13, 1919 for a radio play for BBC Radio in England. Sounds familiar?! Well, the truth is, these two ladiesRupinderjit Kaur and Annalisa Hounsomefierce in their passion for writing, brisk in their pursuit for historical data and determined in their approach to reach as wide an audience as possible, are sparing no effort to complete their expedition in the twenty odd days they have at their disposal. What makes their story so appealing is that as freelance writers they convinced the Arts Council in England they had a story to tell and got the funding to do it! This is our second play and we wanted to write on a historical event and no we had not seen the movie when the idea cropped up in our minds, chuckles Annalisa. Their first play, scripted by them, Tiaan (on the festival of Teej) is to be broadcast in February 2007 on BBC Radio. The two met at Lancaster University up in the North and have been together for the past 10 years firing their delight for English and writing. Annalisa has also finished a Masters degree in film and television and the two have been rewriting scripts forever! Seriously though, their screenplay, a romantic comedy about an Indian woman in England who wins a husband for her daughter on the Internet is almost ready, this apart from the childrens books they have written. Balti Towers is a cross-cultural story for young ones and has been illustrated by someone in India. How has their Indian experience been so far, not withstanding the fact that they have come here earlier on a backpacking expedition? The reception in Chandigarh has been overwhelming and we are meeting someone who was at Jallianwallah Bagh when the massacre took place, says Rupinderjit. They have met up with a plethora of writers in the city like Dev Bhardwaj, Kedar Nath Kedar, Sham Singh, Govardhan Gabbi, Gul Chauhan and P S Narula to draw together material for their play. We came with an open mind. We know it is going to be a drama and we are looking at the possibility of telling the story from a single persons journey, even a descendant who goes back and comes to an understanding of how the events shaped history and his own life. Does freelance writing keep their chula burning at home, so to speak? It is not easy, smile the girls so Rupinderjit teaches 11 to 18 year olds English and media and Annalisa works with people with learning disabilities and helps raise funds for them. They may not be the worlds best paying jobs but they are deeply satisfying. Finally to augment their research, these two creative sparkles have also started a blog site to initiate dialogues between writers in India and England so that notes, ideas, thoughts and writings can be shared. Check out www.writersindia-blog.blogspot.com. Life, after all, is about following dreams and passions and these two friends are determined to get their fill! Lounging around Home surely is where hearth is, but fun lies undoubtedly in the Family Lounge. This is one place where you share your joys and tribulations with the ones closest to you. Comfort takes precedence over design, but not necessarily style in the Family Lounge. This is one room, which holds you together when the going gets tough, be vibrant enough to get up and dance with you when you are rejoicing and cuddle you up when you need warmth. Irrespective of the size, you take the lead and put things in order of your choice in Family Lounge. Though its a nice idea to have a singular interior theme running in the whole area or room, family lounge is where amalgamation of themes may well add to the character to the room. However, ensure that fusion does not lead to confusion! Sink into a Queen Anne chair with a book in your hand with Victorian peg table to while away your evening, the main seating could well be fully upholstered modern sofas with English carved chairs and glass coffee table to hold the knick-knacks. English Country furniture gels well with Colonial looks. Chippendales can be married with Chinoiserie styled accessories whilst Rococo can be housed with rustic Spanish designs. Opt for low seating for kids to make merry which could be tucked away into your bay window itself and accommodate playpen if there are babies in the house too. Floor level Afghani seating is the best informal and relaxed seating option. Regular height seating for adults could be made into clusters rather than straight seats pushed against the wall. Slightly raised seating option is a kinder option for the knees of the elderly. A bridge/chess or a board game table is useful to have in the Family Lounge. A small library can also be provided if your family members enjoying reading. Think of a mobile drinks trolley if you enjoy your tipple. A fully enclosed study table is also useful to take care of your day-to-day paperwork and bills. Is there room for a table for two to eat? You may wish to install complete entertainment unit within this room, especially if you dont have separate room for your home theatre system. However ensure that you follow the guidelines to achieve recommended viewing distance between the screen and the seating. If room is large enough then create a train track for kids Thomas Engines and a mini golf range. Put an easel by the window if painting beckons you or a comfy day bed to satisfy the couch potato in you. If you feel restricted by the faux finishes or textures on the walls and wall paneling is too formal, then bravely play with alternative materials and paints to create a haven for yourself. Put textured leatherette upto three feet from bottom and top it with contrasting wall paint. Get stripes painted on the wall rather than singular colour. Create a fabric umbrella for the ceiling. Alternatively stretch ethnic or embroided fabrics onto four wooden frames. Now suspend these panels from the ceiling. If the furniture is heavy and the flooring rich, choose blinds, shades or just textured glass for windows. Alternatively, if furniture is sleek and the flooring is plush, opt for drapes, valances and curtains. Best lighting option is to have sliding control light fittings; downlighters for reading, painting or board game activities, uplighters to create diffused lighting in darker recesses of the room and lamps placed judiciously to add style. Family Lounge is an ideal place to create a cluster of your family photos. Choose paintings and prints, which complement the interiors you have created or give two hoots and hang what you wish to on the walls. Courtsey: A.P. Singh Besten & Co. Face to face with Truth After the success of his play Ek Aur Dronacharya, city director Umesh Kant is all set to explore truth in his forthcoming play Ek Satya Harishchandra, says Parbina Rashid UPSTAGE: A scene from Ek Aur Dronacharya that has won director Umesh Kant (below) and award.  Photos by Parvesh Chauhan What is the common thing between Raja Harishchandra and a modern day politician? To quote our own theatre personality Umesh Kant, both have been sold out, one for the truth, and the other for reasons that can be anything from money to religion or maybe for no reason at all. This is what Umesh is planning to explore in his next production Ek Satya Harishchandra what makes people to sell out their soul. Buoyed with enthusiasm after his Ek Aur Dronacharya became a major hit at the Sudershan Rang Mahotsav in Pune (it was adjudged the best play of the year), Umesh is all set to start Ek Satya with a renewed vigour. And of course he has a reason for it, for he already has received an invitation to take part in the festival this year too. This script by Dr Laxmi Narayan Lal has been lying with me for a long time. I have been thinking to make a play on this as anybody can relate to this topic, says Umesh. This hard-hitting play is going probe into questions like what is truth, is it right to hail Raja Harishchandra who was stupid enough to sacrifice everything just to prove himself right or a normal person who lives life smoothly, without hurting others or making much compromises in life? This, Umesh is going to show through two parallel characters, one ofcourse Raja Harischandra and the other a politician called Deodhar who sometimes sells his self-respect, honestly and conscience for none other than materialistic gain. The most interesting aspect about buying and selling, which has come out during my research for this play is one who has sold himself once will always be the seller and never the buyer, says Umesh. Interesting observation! Umesh now is looking for a cast of 22 actors, dancers and musicians to be part of his production. I have finalised a few actors but I am looking for new faces for this play, says Umesh, adding that he is going to hold an audition either by the end of April or first week of May to finalise the cast. And to fit his bill, one has to be a mature and serious actor. To be produced under the banner Theatre Lab, the play will see some new innovations in the technical aspect too. This one is going to be a Sanskritised based play in which I will use human forms to create backgrounds with minimalistic set designing, as he paints a mental picture, we can not help but making a comparison with the famous Vijay Tendulkars play Ghasiram Kotwal and he agrees, Yes, something similar. And this inspiration to be experimental came from his newfound knowledge that though Marathi and Gujarati theatre is far ahead of us, when it comes to the technical aspect, Chandigarh has a lot to offer. This is the major point that helped his Ek Aur Dronacharya beat eight other productions at the national level. He has done us proud once and by the time he finishes painting his dream to us, we know he is going to make it again! CAMPUS CAFE A bejewelled affair Alluring strings with sparkling alphabets secured tightly to the mobile phones are spelling out fashion on the Panjab University campus and college grounds, glamorously. If you havent seen the cords with diamond-studded letters stringed together to form names, even `I love you messages, just drive down the road winding its way through the academic environs. You will find the faux diamond letters gleaming in the sun as so many damsels of the world trot down the campuses swinging the phones, gorgeously. Right guys, bejeweled letters the latest craze amidst youngsters spinning in a commercial world of malls and mobiles. Gone are the days when the guys would present plastic key chains with embossed names to their gals. Or else, go in for bracelets with tiny beads secured together with a thread, again to form names, says Chetan Kumar, a student of Panjab Universitys Department of Laws. They now go in for the sparkling jewels to say materialistically whats deep in their emotional hearts. Just in case you havent picked up the stuff, do not worry. You can still take home the jewels, or gift them tenderly to someone you love, by pulling out some hard currency. For each alphabet, you have to pay something like Rs 35. Then you have to pay another Rs 50 for the strap attached to the string on which the silver-plated studded alphabets are secured, says Raman of Jewels in Sector 11. So, you end up paying more if your gal has a long name. But the end product is worth the cost. After all, the smile on her face is priceless. If you do not wish to spend so much on the stuff, you can go in for plain silver-plated letters. Each alphabet is costing just Rs 10, says Raman. You can indulge in further cost-cutting by buying a wrist strap instead of a mobile string. In funky red, alluring orange, oceanic blue, baby pink and host of other colours, each strap is costing just Rs 20. So guys, hop into your car and pick up the stuff. What are you waiting for? Scrumptious reward Here is another reason why you should have studied before the annual examinations: Nirulas is rewarding the students who have performed exceptionally well. In fact, the fast food joint is giving triple sundaes free to students securing above 90 per cent. All you have to do is to drive down to the joint with your detailed mark sheet and grab the sundae without pulling anything out of your wallet. And kids, dont miss the opportunity. For, the delicacy is otherwise costing as much as Rs 75. But you will have to hurry for the offer is valid just till end of this month. Charm around his ears If you think gals have all the fun with jewellery, and there is hardly anything available for the guys patrolling the length and the breadth of the campuses, you are divorced from reality, actually. For, chunk jewellery shops across the city are offering funky ear rings in ebony for guys too. Right, you can wear them in one or both the ear lobes for that cool dude look. Go in for the ones shaped like a snake. Or else, pick up the ones carved out like a scorpion. You can go in for the traditional hoops also. Folks, the stuff is not very expensive either. Each ring is costing anywhere between Rs 45 and Rs 75 depending upon the size and the design, says Yogender Kumar of a gift and chunk jewellery shop in Sector 11. They look good and tend to give you that oh-so-hard-to-resist macho image. So guys, why should girls have all the fun! Pick up the stuff, now!  Saurabh Malik YOUTH SPEAK Know yourself Knowing oneself is the most important aspect of life and most difficult too. But one has to do it and once it is done, half of the battle is won. All I want to say is know yourself and believe in yourself. As it is said if you love your job, you dont have to work even for a single day. Let me explain. Take this example as children grow up some like playing with cars, some with bats and some with guns. This shows that every child has different interests and inclinations. We need to see where our interest lies-cars, bats or guns. We need to realise that all of us have certain distinct traits or qualities. We have to see what we have inside us. We have to look for it. And yes, dont be bothered by others. As I said believe in your self. And as the great spiritual leader Osho saidthe greatest courage in the world is not to imitate others, to live ones own life as authentically as possible, what so ever the cost. Live your life without being bothered by the moralists, puritans, priests and people who go on advising. Live your life. And by pressurising your self into doing something that you dont want to do will only make you unhappy. So if you have a dream or are passionate about some thing then you must persevere and not give up if no one else believes you. If we enter a field that does not interest us, we can never grow in that field. Lack of interest will result in lack of hard work, which will eventually lead you to failure. So in the end-see where your interest is, what your inner soul says. Respect your feelings and go for the kill. Listen to others but always follow your gut feeling. It will never betray you.  Varun Garg HOPSCOTCH To be or not to be Long years ago one saw a rather poignant sketch of two birds painted by late Kaushik Sahib, an artist of the city. One bird stood on the ground and the other was stretching its wings in flight. The sketch is still etched in memory and what is more one even recalls the very poetic caption: Those who stood rooted to the ground; and those who flew away. Some lines are hard to forget and more so those that touch the dilemma of life. I remember Kaushik explained the line saying that it was inspired by one of his sisters who moved abroad and settled there. That was his personal inspiration for the drawing that had to it an element of sadness that one finds hard to explain. It is something like, to be or not to be very Hamlet like. Come to the life of the artists, of the city this dilemma has been one that has to be constantly addressed and there are actually some who take wing and fly away to more vibrant art climes and there are others who stuck it out here for reasons that may not necessarily have to do with art but heart. The outcome was predictable. Those who flew away got a larger share of fame, name and money. Those who stayed back remained relatively unknown for thats how it will be Que Sera Sera. MAN & WOMAN: A painting by Viren Tanwar Global market An artist who was in midst of this dilemma in recent times is none other than the very talented Viren Tanwar who is back to painting, showing and selling like never before. Gallery owners and other promoters of his art wanted him to be in Delhi where the scene is. So there was this lone Haryanvi Jat painter of the country looking for a studio-cum- home in the Nirvana complex in Gurgaon. But he realised that there was no Nirvana there for the painter who was basically a small-town boy having traversed from Hisar to Chandigarh. So he decided to paint in his Sector-48 home here. But the small town boy is certainly going places with a complete sellout at a show recently in Singapore and another group show coming up at Lahore to be followed by a show in Hong Kong. So to cut the long story short, it is not a bad idea to paint in Cgarh and exhibit and sell all over the globe for we are now living in a global village. Life of a writer A meeting with Hindi poet Gagan Gill, who was married to celebrated fiction writer Nirmal Verma and also happens to be older sister to Rabbi of the Bulla fame, got one looking before and after. Sharing her experience of giving up journalism and devoting herself fully to writing, Gagan said, Just being a writer was not enough, I wanted to live the life of a writer. Aqfter the initial hesitation of accepting the statement, One realised that there was merit in what she said. And going by the blossoming art market, one is tempted to live the life of an artist. Well, Que Sera again!  Nirupama Dutt FILM & FASHION Elton John patches up with George Michael Veteran singer Sir Elton John has requested his one time pal George Michael to end their simmering feud, telling the former Wham! singer hes still his friend. The British pop star recently blamed the 59-year-old superstar over his troubled lifestyle, saying, Eltons turned my life into a soap opera. But Elton instead has paid a deaf ear to Georges latest verbal assault, insisting that hes tired of all the verbal sniping and wants the feud to end. Friends of the mega-rich star say his refusal to respond speaks volumes and signals his desire to put the bitching behind them.

D rug abuse and alcoholism cut across all sections of women but it is seldom talked about. These are things that men indulge in, goes the belief, thus sweeping under the carpet a growing problem. According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), nine million women have used illegal drugs in the past year and 3.7 million women have taken prescription drugs for non-medical reasons. In India, illicit liquor consumption is estimated to cause about 800 deaths and 3000 disabilities every year, says the World Health Organisation (WHO). Women show symptoms of intoxication sooner than men, and chronic use of cannabis, heroin and cocaine causes menstrual dysfunction and contributes to obstetrical complications and foetal loss for pregnant women. However, the problem of drug addiction among women is largely related to social conditioning. Studies of women who seek treatment for alcohol and other drug problems have revealed a dramatic connection between domestic violence, childhood abuse, and substance abuse. Women substance abusers have high levels of depression, anxiety, and feelings of powerlessness, and low levels of self-esteem and self-confidence. The wish to remain anonymous among women is understandable. The social consequences attending to women who are drug abusers are very different from the consequences experienced by their male counterparts because of social norms that define appropriate female behaviour. As NIDA observes, ""Women who abuse drugs often face a greater social stigma than men because they fail to fulfill our societys standard for female morality as well as their traditional role as the stabilising force in the family."" This is more than true in countries with patriarchal social norms, as in India. In this country the number of women, especially in the urban milieu taking to alcohol and drugs, is increasing though reliable statistics are not available. Women in the fashionable jet-set are said to be routinely into drug abuse. Vijayan Pavamani, who started Calcutta Samaritans, Kolkata, an NGO which works extensively in the field of drug use, recalls, ""In the 70s when we began, starting with a helpline for the distressed, we found that the many girls from the fashionable Loreto College were into Mandrax, which was very popular then. But today people have gone for more dangerous stuff, like brown sugar or heroin."" Mandrax was the trade name of a barbiturate type sedative drug commonly prescribed as a sleeping pill by doctors in the 60s and 70s. It was also used as a street drug and there were many fatal overdoses. Says Dr Pratima Murthy, associate professor, Psychiatry, De-addiction unit, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (Nimhans), Bangalore, ""Economic independence, changing roles in society, entry of women into male-dominated areas, greater acceptability of social drinking and easy availability of alcohol have strongly contributed to rising incidence of alcohol consumption in women. Adolescents hit the bottle because of reasons that could range from depression to peer pressure, glamour and disappearing stereotypes about femininity."" Kripa Foundation of Mumbai which works with addicts has found that there has been a steady increase in the number of women who drink. A sizeable number of homemakers have taken to alcohol due to loneliness as their spouses get busy with their careers. It is a cause for concern that brown sugar, which is very addictive, is becoming more popular while cocaine which is very expensive is less in use. Cannabis, Ecstasy, Ketamine, etc are widely used. According to studies, women are introduced to the drug or alcohol by boyfriends or husbands. For many men living a life on the high street, with more money and more options to spend, a smart companion connotes a woman who can share the same lifestyle. In the process many women get hooked for life. In many instances substance abusers resort to prostitution to pay for their living expenses and also for the drug they consume as families more often than not throw them out of the house when they find out the truth. A year ago, the Calcutta Samaritans started a detoxification and rehabilitation womens wing at its Arunoday Midway Home with 10 beds. So far 22 women have gone through the programme and the rate of recovery has been a 58 per cent, it is claimed. Some of these women have been driven out of their homes, they live at the Home and work outside. Some of them work as counsellors themselves. It is not enough to de-addict but also to give an alternative livelihood or occupation. Prevention programmes specially designed for women, and treatment and appropriate rehabilitation, are needed for effective prevention and control of substance abuse among women, UNDOC points out. Recognising the problem is the first step to recovery, experts say.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,10/29/2014 0:00,,"STAR TRACK A close call Actress Anne Hathaway has revealed that she almost caught hypothermia after spending hours in cold water, while shooting a scene for her upcoming film Interstellar. The 31-year-old actress recalled that things were getting a little hazy and she was not sure if she could feel her toes after spending hours submerged in cold water, wearing a leaking space suit, said a publication. ""I was feeling all sorts of weird flashes and things were getting a little hazy around the edges, and thats when I turned to our first (assistant director), and I said, Hey, I dont know that much about hypothermia, but what are the symptoms?"" she said. ""And I explained what was going on and he said, ""Oh! Like, right now?"" And Im like, ""Yeah!"" And so then he went over to Chris (Nolan) and Chris was like, OK - lets roll, lets roll, lets roll right now! And we were done shortly thereafter,"" she added. Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan, also stars Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. It is slated to release on October 29.  PTI Sweet smell of success Singer turned fashion designer Victoria Beckham has been named Britains most successful entrepreneur after seeing her fashion empire grow over the last five years. The 40-year-old singer-turned-fashion designer has topped the list of over 100 business people after her fashion empires turnover rose from 1 million pound to a staggering 30 million pound in just five years, with her staff growing from three employees to 100, reported a website. ""Shes got a real business, some design talent and some business acumen. She has built something real out of her own celebrity which is quite a contemporary story. She deserves to be celebrated,"" she said. Victoria - who has children Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and Harper, three, with husband David Beckham - launched her eponymous label in 2008 and opened her first stand-alone boutique in London last month. The magazine considered factors such as number of jobs created, overall estimated wealth and sales figures over a five-year period in compiling the list. Amit & Meeta Patel, founders of pharmaceutical group Auden Mckenzie, and Mahmud Kamani of Boohoo.com took second and third place in the list respectively.  PTI Parineeti unplugged! Parineeti Chopra will be next seen in Kill/Dil, in which her character is glamorous. Here she talks about being single, dating rumours and much more. Girl alone Its not difficult but I do wish I had a boyfriend. Honestly, I miss having a love life. It is really frustrating not having someone to call up or just hug or be there for. Its sad. Otherwise, I like my independence. Link-up with Aditya Roy Kapur That is ridiculous! It doesnt bother me at all. Any film I do, they link me with the co-star. My co-stars are also used to it now. During Aashiqui 2, Aditya was linked with Shraddha (Kapoor). Now hes linked to me. It goes on. Sidharth (Malhotra) is linked with every co-star. Alia (Bhatt) too is linked with every co-star. We laugh at these stories. Everyone is dating everybody. Open discussion We did speak about it too. All of us, Alia, Shraddha and I have done intimate scenes with the boys. We are all linked with each other and nobody cares about it. Alia and I are supposed to be fighting, Sid and Varun are allegedly fighting, Arjun and Ranveer are fighting too. But when we sit together, we dont care about whats written. We know that half of the things are untrue. Rumours galore That happened with Maneesh (Sharma) and me. Its so funny that Maneesh is not even an actor. He gets pissed off nowadays. Maneesh and I would watch every film together. Wed also eat out. Now we have stopped that. Now I go to his house and eat. Or we eat at YRF. Its become so strange. I think twice about hanging out in public with him. The flipside Yes, the constant public and media scrutiny is a drawback of this profession. If I have to go out with Aditya, we think twice before stepping out like, Oh we cant go to Bandra because there will be photographers. We both know the truth that we arent seeing each other. But others get affected with the rumours. Our parents get affected. If he has a love life, then the girlfriend will get upset. Split wide open Jennifer Lawrence and Coldplay rocker Chris Martin have reportedly ended their four-month old romance. Lawrence began seeing Martin in late June, shortly after her split with X-Men co-star Nicholas Hoult, while Martin announced his separation from ex Gwyneth Paltrow after more than ten years of marriage in March. Lawrence, 24, was most recently seen with Martin, 37, when he performed with Kings of Leon at the Hollywood Bowl earlier this month. She was also in the audience when Martin took the stage in September at the iHeart Radio Music Festival. Earlier reports had surfaced that the couple had problems in their relationship. Even their split rumours have been doing the rounds for a couple of weeks now. Have they or have they not? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, the two are said to be taking some time apart from each other to figure things out.  PTI In black and white Tiger Shroff, who rose to fame with his debut film Heropanti, prefers to style himself. He goes for shopping himself and his wardrobe largely comprises comfortable clothes. However, he also has a section of black and white shirts and t-shirts. The young lad prefers to dress in either of the two colours when he makes public appearances. If anyone has closely observed, Tiger is usually spotted in either of the two colours. He has an interesting collection of achromatic shades in his wardrobe. Behind the sets of PK Aamir Khan is completely dedicated to his movies. He has eaten approximately ten thousand paans during the making of PK. He used to have paans before and during every shot to get the stains on his lips and inside his mouth. He had a paan wala on the sets and then he customised his paan recipe. Quirky is cool! Zoya Akhtar has recently worked with Ranveer Singh who will be next seen in Kill/Dil. She likes the title track of the movie and finds it cool and quirky.

And, so was born JugalBandiyan. Together for a couple of months, Preeti, Reshma Das and Shalu Mehra have been singing in and around Delhi, and aim to go pan- India pretty soon. They sing Bollywood style, so if you want old new Hindi numbers spluttered with some Sufi and ghazals, well, they are the ones for you. They are all trained in music  Preeti is the daughter of known bhajan singer CK Nagrajan; Shalu, daughter of singers Ganesh and Vijayalakshmi and Reshma has trained under her Guru Pandit Baldevraj Verma. A Sufi lover, Reshma did try her luck in reality shows, did get past the auditions in a few but never tasted success. ""In the hands of Paramjit Singh and his company Golden Melodies Pvt Ltd, we already have a platform that singers yearn to get through reality shows,"" says Preeti. Their favourite bands include Indian Ocean, Advaita, Destinys Child and Mati Baani. Among singers its Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle and Hariharan. Though they are just doing covers for now, who knows they would sing their own compositions in the times to come, as the talks with music directors are already on. Proper Punjabi folk with a modern twist is what they have on their mind. Happy they are in their own space, ""We have got a super response; beautiful girls singing beautifully has to be a hit,"" they echo! We agree that they sing decently well, going by a few lines they croon impromptu. mona@tribunemail.com Concerns of age Directed by Mahendra Kumar, soon to be staged play Nat Samrat, delves into the issue of generation gap and loneliness Amarjot Kaur With an aim to treat the audience of Chandigarh a cocktail of drama and art, the Samvaad Theatre Group, in association with the Ajnabi Rangkarmi, will stage a play titled Nat Samrat, which is a concoction of entertainment and evocation. In conversation with the director of the play, professor Mahendra Kumar, who has over 40 years of experience in theatre, the banter treads on the relevance and concept of the play. ""Kuldip Sharma, the director of Tagore Theatre, who is also a theatre veteran, was rather keen that I direct the play Nat Samrat, which was originally written in Marathi,"" begins Mahendra. As Mahendra tells us about how Kuldip Sharma convinced him to direct the play, he also elaborates on his reason for choosing the play. ""I get inspired by a good content or good text,"" he says. While it took as long as two months for Mahendra to finally shape up the play along with as many as sixteen actors, he says it was an extremely satisfying and fulfilling experience for him to have worked with Kuldip. As he elaborates on the plot of the film, he shares that it aims to give people some food for thought. ""The idea of staging a play is not to give people some medicine or a concrete remedy. Most of the plays are only a reflection of the society and this one too aims at generation gap and the strength of an artist,"" he says. Kuldip will be seen playing the lead role in the play that delves into the emotional turmoil of an experienced theatre actor, who has been awarded with the Nat Samrat award, after his children abandon him when he is old. (The play will be performed on October 30 and 31, 2014, at the Tagore Theatre from 6:30 pm onwards) amarjot@tribunemail.com Future Shock Dial luxury So are you planning to buy the adorable Vertu? Nishtha Shukla Anand Owning the Vertu is a mark of absolute exclusivity and a preserve of the elite. However, manufacturers of the prohibitively expensive phones have introduced a somewhat lower range of phones with the Vertu Aster. While the Vertu Ti comes at a price range of Rs. 6,00,000, Vertu Aster is that wee bit more affordable with a price hovering at Rs 4,00,000. The Vertu Aster is a wonderful phone to own because it comes with the high-end 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor along with a 4.7-inch 1080p display. The phone gets its elite look with a 5.1-inch 117 carat sapphire crystal cover. It also comprises a 13MP Hasselblad certified camera and 2.1MP front-facing snapper. Technologically, Aster is a more advanced phone compared to the Ti. However, would you buy a Vertu for its specs or price? Negative side Aster buyers will have their disadvantages though-in terms of the services. * To start with, this range of Vertu phones does not have a Black PVD titanium red gold mixed metal model. The lowest model also has only calf skin. If you want Ostrich Skin or Karung skin, theres a steeper price attached to those. * Secondly, the phones only come with six months of their Classic Concierge service. For models like the VertuTi, buyers get a whole year of service. * Thirdly, Vertu Aster buyers will not get a dedicated agent. Now, thats not very kind! Are you planning to change your phone? Take a look at the Vertu Aster if you really do want an uber luxury phone at a good price.

If a person gives up alcohol, why does he go back to it after some months or even years?  Mrs Singh, Chandigarh Depression is one of the most common forms of mental illness, affecting about 15% of the population. About a third of people with depression may have drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. In drug and alcohol abuse, the dopaminergic neurons in the brains reward area (ventral tegmental area) are stimulated. Repeated activation leads to a feeling of well-being and if one does not get the drug, he or she craves for it. Eventually, with increased tolerance, the individual feels unwell most of the time and will use the drug to feel normal. Even if he gives it up for months, often even one drink can sensitise the neural circuits to want more and more. Thus, people usually are advised to quit completely. Some symptoms are common to both depression and addiction. The frontal cortex may be involved with disturbances of cognition (i.e. concentration, mental tasks), the hippocampus with feelings of suicidality, and the VTA and nucleus accumbens may mediate anhedonia (i.e. lack of pleasure) and decreased motivation. The fact is that addiction and depression seem to share common neural substrates. It is not necessary that all people will relapse after quitting. There are many factors. People with an interest in other activities, who get a meaning out of other things such as exercise, yoga, helping others in need, a passionate hobby et al are more likely to quit. People who join groups like Alcoholics Anonymous have also been seen to be more likely to quit. Can forgetfulness in dementia be reversed?  Col PS, Panchkula In some people, forgetfulness may be due to nutritional or vitamin deficiencies. Also, many emotional problems, such as recent stressful events, may cause a condition similar to dementia, but the actual cause is depression. In such cases, antidepressants and lifestyle changes help. Usually once Alzheimers or other dementias start, they usually progress, but regular medicines such as cholinesterase inhibitors, if used in proper doses, can slow down memory loss and should be used regularly. Also a person who exercises regularly and stays active in household tasks, or plays games for memory and concentration, does better than those who dont. People with dementia should be kept up-to-date about the details of their lives, such as the time of the day, where they live and what is happening at home or in the world. Memory aids may help in the day-to-day living of patients in the earlier stages of dementia. Some families find that a big calendar, a list of daily plans, notes about simple safety measures and written directions describing how to use common household items are very useful aids.

After studying journalism, how did the TV bug bit you? I had always wanted to do TV commercials. All my friends are actors and one day, one of them told me to audition for an advertisement. It worked and I got selected. I began working in the TV world and eventually got used to the work. What is your take on the casting couch in the television industry? No, I dont think so. In fact, there is a proper procedure for everything, right from casting to filming. I havent come across anything like that. How have you planned your career? Currently, I am focusing on Laut Aao Trisha. I am also giving auditions for movies and commercials simultaneously. I would prefer doing a youthful film such as Yaariyaan so that I get to play a role that suits my age. How do you maintain your svelte body? Well, I am naturally slim but I have a tendency to put on weight on my face. To keep that in control, I drink lukewarm water every day at bedtime and in the morning. I also go for a job at Joggers park. I eat homemade goods and enjoy a protein rich meal once a week. Are you seeing someone? I hope to date a man. But for now, I am dating my work! Career is my top priority. You are a Delhiite. How are you adjusting in Mumbai? It was tough moving to Mumbai initially. It took some time for me to adjust to the ways of the city. Here, neither the infrastructure is good nor the traffic is easy going. Moreover, Mumbai is an expensive city for living. However, there are good things about it as well. There is no transport issue here and women feel safe. As compared to Delhi people, Mumbaikars are more liberal, reserved and simple.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,1/29/2004 0:00,,"BJP undecided on alliance with INLD Yoginder Gupta Tribune News Service Chandigarh, January 28 The BJP is still undecided on its alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal in Haryana, according to sources. Sources said a decision in this regard was expected on February 1 when BJP President M. Venkaiah Naidu was due to visit Chandigarh. He would preside over a meeting of the core group of the Haryana BJP to elicit the views of state party leaders about the continuation of the partys alliance with the INLD. Sources say barring the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Mr I.D. Swami, all other four BJP MPs from the state were opposed to the continuation of the alliance with the INLD. However, now even Mr Swami, sources say, has conveyed to the high command that the BJP should not share the burden of anti-incumbency sentiments in Haryana. The sitting BJP MPs are believed to have told the high command that the party would do better if it contested all 10 Lok Sabha seats on its own in Haryana.

BJP leaders feel that even if the high command forced them to continue the alliance with the INLD, neither partner would be sincere to each other. Despite their best efforts, they would not be able to transfer the BJP vote to the INLD candidates. Similarly, they feel that in certain constituencies the INLD voter would not vote for the BJP nominees.

Meanwhile, Mr Ajay Singh Chautala, the elder son of the Chief Minister, has decided to contest from the Bhiwani Lok Sabha constituency.

Later that year, Mossack Fonseca ended its relationship with the companies.Zuma and representatives of the companies have rejected allegations of wrongdoing and claimed the oil deals are ""quite attractive"" to the DRC government.Also implicated is John Addo Kufuor, the eldest son of Ghana's former president John Agyekum Kufuor, who led the country from 2001 to 2009.A trained accountant, the younger Kufuor is said in the documents to have controlled a $75,000 bank account in Panama for his father and his mother that he ran through an offshore company.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,1/23/2002 0:00,,"ISSUES AND THEMES Ethical issues in blood transfusion T HE role of ethics in the development of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) and recommendations to health care providers is to ensure that values, which may not be adequately incorporated into the law, are given reasonable consideration. The framers and users of the guidelines must be aware of the potential ethical conflicts inherent in many medical decisions, and the guidelines must reflect a thoughtful consideration and balancing of the issues. Like the legal issues, the ethical issues related to blood transfusions are fundamentally no different than those relating to most forms of medical treatment. One feature that may be somewhat different is that in response to the fear of HIV, consent to blood transfusions has taken on an increased significance, such that the amount of information and level of consent required are closer to that usually required for more complex and risky procedures. In this section, several ethical issues related to blood transfusion are discussed in practical terms. This is not an exhaustive discussion; it is intended to provide the reader with a general understanding of the issues. Risk: A major ethical concern surrounding the use of blood products is that the public perception of the risk is, in most cases, far greater than the objectively measurable risk. This raises questions related to the true need for increased access to alternatives to anonymous donor blood products and the requirement for fully informed consent. However, the perception of risk must be recognised. The physician should understand the patients point of view and the patients fears and suffering. Access to the anonymous donor-based blood system and alternatives: In Canada, blood is currently available, free of charge, to all Canadians requiring it or its components. The system is a voluntary one, in which anonymous donors are not paid for their donations. One of the questions being asked is whether alternatives to the anonymous donor system should be made available to all or some recipients of blood. Alternatives, such as directed donations and the use of autologous blood, may reduce the already low risk of contamination while introducing substantially higher costs into the system. Currently, there is a significant additional cost involved in the collection, storage and delivery of non-anonymous blood. Therefore, in the short term it is economically more efficient to rely on the traditional system. However, over the long term, the financial premium may not be as great as it appears. Like any preventive programme, there is a cost saving associated with the harm prevented. Although it may not be possible to determine this yet, it must be considered in a cost-benefit analysis. The larger issue is whether the financial cost of alternatives to anonymous blood transfusions are justified. In addition to financial costs, ethics requires consideration of the costs and benefits at other levels: societal and psychological. In the end, a multifactorial consideration may favour the allocation of resources to research on new medical interventions that obviate the need for transfusion or on improving current alternatives. Decisions about access to alternatives may require a discussion about the broader societal good versus the individual good. The greater good of society may dictate the minimal use of directed and autologous donations as they may be an unnecessary drain on the health care budget. However, the individual good may require allowing such procedures as they provide psychologic benefits to the patient, for example, parents donating blood for their child. Depression and voluntariness: It is legally clear that a mentally competent adult is entitled to refuse any medical treatment, including a blood transfusion. However, if screening indicates that a patient may be incapable, further expert opinion is generally recommended to ensure that the refusal is truly informed and voluntary, particularly in cases where the patients life is at risk. One particular area of concern is patients with underlying depression that may influence the decision of a seemingly competent person. Cultural issues: In some cultures medical decision-making is the responsibility of men; in other cultures the physician is regarded as an authority figure who is not to be questioned. Ethically, it is necessary for the physician to respect the cultural practices of the patient while meeting legal and professional obligations. To accomplish this, the physician may explain to the patient and the patients family members, either directly or via a trusted member of the patients cultural community, the need to provide information and obtain consent. Conclusion: It is difficult to reduce the legal and ethical obligations of physicians to a set of guidelines. Although the legal principle of informed consent can be stated in a few words, it does not convey the scope of responsibility and how it may vary depending on the circumstances, the patient and the procedure. It certainly fails to convey the ethical complexity involved in a physician-patient interaction and the potential clash of values and beliefs that can occur in our multicultural society. The various issues demonstrate that many judgement calls arise in the day-to-day practice of all physicians. These judgements require awareness and respect for legal and ethical considerations, but above all, they require an empathetic understanding of the patient and his or her situation.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,10/28/2001 0:00,,"PERSPECTIVE The changing face of terrorism: A global view A. K. Lal T HE concept and nature of classical terrorism is being re-shaped in the modern era. There is an ongoing Revolution in Terrorist Affairs (RTA) due to the impact of modern technology, globalisation and the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). However, the classical definition of terrorism and its causal factors continue to have the same historical roots as hither-to-fore. As we transcend the new millennium, we can marginally see the transformation in the changing nature and shades of terrorism. The ongoing evolution of operational philosophy of terrorist groups, now appears to be even encompassing the upper limit of the spectrum of violence ranging from the lower level of sub-nationalism, ideological fundamentalism and to the extreme end of transnational state sponsored terrorism precipitating, may be into a WMD related threat in a future scenario. Terrorism means intimidation by the systematic use of violence as a means of both governing and opposing existing governments. The current western usage has restructured the sense, on purely ideological grounds, to the retail violence of those who oppose the established order. Historically speaking, one can trace certain aspects of the traits of terrorism to the ancient civilisations of Greece and Rome. Even the Vedas and Mahabharat have glimpses of terrorist acts. It thrives on fear psychosis. By manipulating fear in a special way, terrorists have always been able to effect human behaviour in a fashion disproportionate to their effort. All violence, as Hannah Arendt has reminded us, is unpredictable. Unlike power, force or strength, violence is always applied with unforeseeable effects. The turn of the century has distinctly seen a resurgence of religious (Islamic) oriented terrorist groups (like Taliban etc) giving the essence of a Pan Islamic agenda. The terrorist groups intellectual and spiritual role model have been a gallery of heroes featuring Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Sorel, Marighella, Mao, Giap, Fanon, Marcuse, Malcolm X, Guevara, Debray, and Guillen and now Osama bin Laden. At the global level, the classical definition of terrorism and the causal factors bear the same roots as over the centuries. However, what is perceptually changing is the nature of terrorism and its tools due to multifarious factors. The new millennium is ushering in many scientific revolutions. Simultaneously, after the demise of the Soviet Union, there is a new world order, which is emerging and causing reconfigurations in international alignment, coupled with the proliferation of WMD technology. For example, there are no more (few?) communist sponsors for Leftist movements. There is yet another phenomenon of the revival of societal and religious fundamentalism tending to culminate towards the theory of civilisation related clashes. This in turn is causing neo-religious fanaticism which is transcending state boundaries and polarising nations based on religious cultures. (The same philosophy can be traced to the times of Ismailis-Nizari, who operated from 1090 to 1275 with the view of Islamist extremists purified version of Islam). There is yet another linkage to this phenomenon, i.e. the challenge to nations for maintaining their strategic autonomy. This is causing an organisational backlash by a religious community, causing accentuation of ad hoc radical fundamentalism like the attack by the Islamic group on New Yorks World Trade Center. However, this phenomenon does not hold theoretically when applied in areas other than West Asia and Asia. The new millennium, which has been blessed by a Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), is also augmenting the potential of the new high-tech terrorists. To properly understand the decisional calculus of terrorist groups, we must identify certain core issues and attributes. Is there a particular attribute common to all terrorists groups, or is there significant variation from one group to another? If it can be determined that many or all terrorist groups actually share a basic hierarchy of wants, a general strategy of Counter-WMD-Terrorist Operations (CWMDTO) can begin to be shaped. Alternatively, if significant variation in preference orderings can be detected between terrorist groups, myriad strategies of an individually tailored nature will have to be identified. A panorama of global terrorism hotpots and their analysis will show the pattern giving the existing gradation of terrorist infested continents. Globalisation is making WMD terrorism a looming threat in todays society, necessitating mock response practice. (Even cyber-terrorism is being categorised as a potential next millennium threat). Osama bin Laden has declared war on the USA. His involvement in the ongoing terrorist attacks in the Asian region is well known. In 1989, scholar on terrorism Robert H. Kupperman gave a foreboding assessment: Speculation about whether terrorist groups would ever dare to use extreme weaponry such as nuclear explosives or biological, chemical or radiological agents that can inflict mass destruction is often dismissed as sensationalist. It is argued that the lack of availability of nuclear materials and the universal horror surrounding the use of chemical or biological weapons would deter their use. The unfortunate reality is that the materials for such weapons have proliferated widely, that the expertise required is actually within their grasp, and that horror is the name of the terrorism game. The subject got validated very soon, after AumShinrikyos 1995 poison gas attack in Tokyo, when media coverage ensured that policy makers and the public could hardly avoid it. Much of what was said had doomsday overtones. For example, expert Walter Laqueur stated that some terrorists almost certainly will use WMD, and a Harvard study accentuated the countrys vulnerability to unconventional terrorism attack, concluding that thousands of people could perish in a bio-terrorist attack and many could meet similar fate in the case of a chemical attack. The tools that terrorists applied earlier were of the conventional variety as they had to keep their popular support intact. Minimum casualty has been their forte. As Brian Jenkins well-known saying goes, terrorists want a lot of people watching, not a lot of people dead. Terrorists, it seemed, observed certain ethical boundaries. In the words of a student of terrorist behavior, terrorism has traditionally used relatively unsophisticated weapons in a limited number of ways to inflict relatively little damage. Another authority on terrorism offers the reminder that terrorism is not about killing. It is a form of psychological warfare in which the killing of a small number of people convinces the rest of us that we are next in line. Even though terrorists did some shocking things, scholars could ascribe an element of predictability to terrorism. For this analogy, many can still argue that the common terrorist will not cross the threshold of WMD terrorism unless it is supported by a state for political reasons. Proliferation of biological agents and use of bio-technology for military or terrorist purpose is an issue of concern. Such technologies will make warfare anonymous and essentially dangerous for human civilisation. The covert delivery of such systems would be very easy. Even terrorist carrying such agents cannot be detected by the current international detection systems in international airports. Therefore, a massive funding is required towards this end. The deduction in summation, which emerge so as to ground and concretise the threat in South Asia are as follows: (i) The psychology of religion based terrorist is more prone to use WMD tool of terrorism. Moreover, it gets the moral backing of the clerics. (ii) In the aftermath of breaking of the Soviet Union and the existence of a nuclear infrastructure, proliferation and pilferage of nuclear weapons (tactical) and fissile material in the hands of such groups cannot be ruled out. (iii) Existing terrorist structures make the following groups amenable to enact a WMD act in the following priority: Osama bin Laden, LTTE, other pan Islamic groups, especially Lashkar-e-Toiba and even Hamas (out of South Asian region). (iv) It is feasible for terrorist groups to procure technology and construct chemical weapons and even bio-weapons in a future scenario, may be by 2005-10. (The chemical and the bio-black markets are proliferating. State support would further complicate the issue.) However, use of chemical weapon is more likely in comparison due to simplicity in its handling. And (v) It may be possible to construct crude nuclear weapons in a future scenario. However, such a terrorist group would need expertise/state support. With empowerment of citizens, rising aspirations, the suffusion of consumerism and easy availability of dual-use technology, we are going to see the emergence of techno-terrorists, who will take resort to sophisticated means of violence to hurt society by use of WMD. Nuclear terrorism and the use of chemical and biological agents are commonly bracketed as WMD. To this can be added cyber terrorism and eco-terrorism. As the concept of no war in its classic Clausewitzian form becomes increasingly irrelevant, we are going to experience greater frequency of sub-conventional forms of conflict. In the event war does occur the adversary could take resort to the use of WMD through terrorists and information warfare weapons. It is in order for an adversary to employ covertly hired terrorist organisations or even its special forces as force multipliers, to support attacks during the command and control and critical infrastructure, destruction phase, the purpose being to cause strategic dislocation. For example, the efficacy of terrorism as a state instrument may fetch more results than conventional high technology. Conventional operations in Kosovo have opened the debate on the relevance and method of such operations, which may have been less catastrophe oriented, had they been planned by employing cyber, information, and covert terrorist operations, even hired, who would have addressed and neutralised the command and control structure without collateral damage including loss of life.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/26/2014 0:00,,"Anyhow, Nawaz Sharif is currently embattled in Islamabad with Imran Khan and Tahirul Qadri, a cleric from Canada, seeking to topple him. This has enabled the Army more obviously to assume control over a weakened premier whose efforts to expand trade with India and try Musharraf for treason are not to the liking of the military as evidenced by spoiling fire across the LOC. The proposed Indo-Pakistan talks are off, thanks to the Pakistani High Commissioners boorish insistence on meeting Hurriyat leaders on the eve of the Foreign Secretary-level talks, despite being warned against doing so. To argue that Pakistani VIPs have consistently met the Hurriyat over many years does not constitute an extra-territorial right. The parallel would not be Indian dignitaries meeting Baloch and Sindhi separatists on the eve of talks on J&K with Pakistan, but of defiantly meeting Gilgit-Baltistan opposition leaders such as Amanullah Khan of the JK Liberation Front and others in Islamabad if they have not been incarcerated or forced to seek refuge in distant shores. These critics have no place in Pakistans tightly-controlled Kashmir colonies ruled by the constitutional ideology of swearing by the ideology of accession to Pakistan. J&K residents, be it the Pandit, emigrant Muslim or others, would gladly seize the rich opportunities that beckon. And non-State subjects should be welcome if they bring investment together with technical, managerial and marketing skills. Pettifogging arguments by little bigots crying wolf about outsider land grab and demographic change must be slapped down for the nonsense they are. Nor can J&K be condemned to be governed by the idiocy of people who ask why the State should not have a Hindu Chief Minister or by the diktats of Pakistans Hurriyat stooges. Umar Farooq dare not even own up to who assassinated his father in 1990 and joins in celebrating the late Mir Waizs martyrdom by his assassins. The Pandits lost their jobs and homes. If they return they will have to make a new beginning. Where? How? Building new ghettoes is no answer. With the Katra-Bannihal- Qazigund railway likely to be operational within two years, and maybe the planned lower-altitude, all-weather Bannihal tunnel as well, trans-Pir Panjal movement will become shorter, quicker and cheaper. With Srinagar becoming an active international airport and an additional 1000 MW of hydro-power coming on stream during this same period, a Baramulla-Srinagar-Qazigund-Bannihal-Katra-Jammu industrial-transport corridor, with a fibre optic transmission line and technical training facilities to boot, could come into being. One can conceive of a series of SEZ hubs along this corridor, specialising in agro-processing, herbal-based pharma, floriculture and IT-enabled services. The same lack of imagination drives the fatuous debate on ways to attract back Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley from where they were driven out under jihadi pressure 25 years ago. Few remember that 50,000 and more Kashmiri Muslims also fled the state - traders to end routine extortion and worse, youth for education and training, and girls to escape forced marriage to jihadi brutes. Central policy has been muddled. In the Assam-Nagaland case, the Sundaram commission recommended a joint survey. Nagaland unreasonably refused and there the matter has rested with periodic conflict. The answer, as this writer has long recommended, is that these disputed border strips be declared Trusteeship Zones, with the two contending states and the Centre as partners for, say, 50 years, and placed under a Centrally-directed joint administration to be developed as rail and road heads, infrastructure, communication and training hubs and special economic zones that attract industry and investment, using cheap NE hydro- power. Higher and technical education and health facilities could be located here. Revenues could be shared. But who is listening? The Assam-Nagaland border dispute has been allowed to drag on for too long. Similar disputes exist between Assam and the new states of Arunachal, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland carved out of it. This stems from the discrepancy between the so-called administrative Inner Line, initially drawn in Assam a century ago to safeguard the settled areas with their tea gardens, oil fields and coal mines, and subsequent revenue lines delineated by the Raj to mark out additional forest working areas as valuable sources of raw material and revenue. So when Assam was reorganised, the question arose as to which Line should be the border. Sadly, inter-state disputes have reduced these areas to no-mans lands and havens for illegal activities. Further, since AFSPA can only be invoked in areas declared disturbed, public pressure can be applied on the authorities concerned to revoke disturbed area proclamations. There has been a wrongful use of AFSPA. These cases have invoked speedy investigation and punishment in many cases. But to lift AFSPA totally in areas subject to militancy, cross-border mischief and terror may be unwise. Militancy often occurs in remote uninhabited areas where city-based magistrates are not at hand to issue the necessary warrants of search, seizure and firing. Hence investiture of such powers in the armed forces is necessary. Ground gained at a great cost over time can be lost in an hour. It might be desirable for the DA Act and AFSPA to be withdrawn in phases in limited areas. But let the armed forces decide on the scope and tempo of such initiatives in collaboration with the local government, whether in the NE or in J&K. Irom Sharmilas release from detention after being forced-fed through 14 years of hunger strike in protest against the imposition AFSPA was short lived as she insisted on continuing her fast. A hunger strike is a weapon of blackmail. Recalling Gandhijis fasts under alien rule is wilfully mistaken. Moreover, a fast-unto-death is tantamount to suicide, a penal offence. If Irom were to perish fasting, the situation could spin out of control and the government would be flayed by its current critics. T he Northeast has been in the news for all the wrong reasons: continuing assaults on the person and dignity of persons from that region in Delhi and elsewhere, which is an absolute national disgrace, continuing controversy over AFSPA, and killings along the disputed Assam-Nagaland border. The Bezboruah Committee has reported on the first issue. But over and above its recommendations, there must be swift and condign punishment of those indulging in and encouraging hooliganism. Also, it is necessary to propagate nationally, and especially in universities, booklets and film clips on the Northeast to educate local barbarians about their own country and countrymen in place of the totally useless official Northeast Newsletter produced today.

There are legal and constitutional means to battle what one considers unjust laws. The Jeevan Reddy Committee recommended a workable compromise a decade back.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,7/7/2002 0:00,,"Shortage of docs in medical colleges Jangveer Singh Tribune News Service Patiala, July 6 A severe shortage has occurred in the teaching departments of all three Government Medical Colleges in the state with a large number of senior faculty members retiring or putting in their papers to go into private practice. The situation has come to such a pass that a few of the departments in the colleges do not have a single person on the rolls while few others would not have any professor on the rolls after a few months. Important departments like surgery are expected to be unmanned in the Medical Colleges in the near future. Giving details the sources said the situation was precarious in important departments like surgery and medicine, both here and in Amritsar. They said two posts of professor of surgery were vacant at both places. They said the medicine department was also undermanned at both places, adding there had been a virtual exodus recently with Professor M.M. Gupta and O.P. Goel retiring and Assistant Professor, Dr Harbans Lal, putting in his papers recently. The sources said the situation was worse in some of the other departments in the Government Medical College here. They said there had been no staff in the Nephrology Department since long. In case of the Cardiology department they said there had been only one professor in Dr Manmohan Singh who retired recently. They said the situation in the Orthopaedics Department was no better with the sole Professor (Dr R.K. Mittal scheduled to retire on July 31. The Directorate of Research and Medical Education (DRME) had identified as many as 533 posts, including 230 doctors and 300 other staff, including nurses and technicians which need to be filled up in all the three Medical Colleges. The Director, Research and Medical Education, Dr Ravinder Singh, when contacted said filling up these posts was necessary to fulfill Medical Council of India (MC) norms, adding the Chief Minister had already given his assent to the requirement and that the proposal had been sent to the government. Sources, however, said that as the government had banned all recruitment except for that which was need-based and approved by it, okaying the recruitment could take some time. They said the process could take as long as one year with the file being proceeded by the department. Finance department and even the Council of Ministers before the recruitment were allowed. The DRME office has, meanwhile, decided to go in for the Department of Promotion Committees which would move juniors to controlling positions in many departments to ensure their smooth functioning. But sources said only further recruitment would solve the problem of shortage of doctors in the colleges as presently promotions meant dissolution of the earlier posts which would not increase the strength of the Medical College. Presently doctors identify the fear of being caught doing private practice as the main factor why doctors were going in for premature retirement. They said use of the Vigilance Department had further fuelled the worry of the doctors. Tragically sources said the doctors who had resigned mostly included key persons who had been playing pivotal roles both in the college and the hospital attached to it. Few doctors have advocated having erstwhile senior doctors of the Medical Colleges who have quit to join private practice for one reason or another, as visiting professors in the Medical College. The sources said this would not only give a fillip to the teaching process with students getting the best minds to teach them, but would serve as a reprieve to the Medical Colleges who were hard pressed for staff. They said such a thing was already being done on a regular basis in Mumbai and that it could be replicated in Punjab also.",{},"['colleges', 'tribune', 'doctors', 'professor', 'medical', 'india', 'sources', 'situation', 'department', 'departments', 'recruitment', 'posts', 'chandigarh']","Important departments like surgery are expected to be unmanned in the Medical Colleges in the near future.

Exploiting a 10-year old vulnerability in Windows, all back-up of electronic transactions and important documentation could be accessed. Even the servers of one of the largest software firms in the country were insecure and the experts could access its most precious asset, the source codes. Despite information technology emerging as one of the most powerful drivers of economy and a crucial means of communication and automation, network security in the country continues to remain in the doldrums. Our research teams scanned 118 networks, including commercial academic and defence, and shockingly found them to be susceptible to simple and basic attacks which can be perpetrated even by a 14-year old kid working out of his garage, Chief Technology Officer of SigInt Network Defence, Pukhraj Singh, said. Stating that in Punjab, his firm found 99 per cent of the networks surveyed to be vulnerable in one form of the other, he said each firm was informed and all possible help was offered to fix the loopholes, but the response was lukewarm. Pukhraj had recently presented a paper on network security at HITBsecConf-2005 in Bahrain, which was attended by security experts and renowned hackers from 18 countries. He will be speaking at the Symposium of Security of Asia Networks in Bangkok and PakConf-2005 later this year. Pukhraj also warned about the growing use of covert channels to clandestinely transmit data over legal channels by by-passing network security devices and firewalls. Clandestine data in such cases rides piggyback on other legitimate data and slips through security systems by exploiting existing weaknesses in the Internet protocols. Text messages can be hidden in images, Pukhraj said. This method is widely used by the Al-Qaeda to establish a completely undetectable communication network, which even the US Government failed to detect, he said. Stating that India requires a complete overhaul of its network security apparatus, Pukhraj said though Information Security (IS) was the most in-demand domain of IT, there was acute shortage of skilled manpower in this arena. Stating that in India the IS market in 2003-04 was Rs 240 crore, which made it the second fastest growing security market in Asia-Pacific, Pukhraj added that the world IS market, which was about $8 billion in 2001, is projected to touch $23 billion in 2006. In India, IS professionals are expected to increase from 18,000 in 2003 to 70,000 by 2008. This coupled with the acknowledged Indian expertise in IT and software, is expected to make India a hub of Information security outsourcing, he added.",{},"['pukhraj', 'tribune', 'market', 'experts', 'service', 'india', 'servers', 'security', 'network', 'chandigarh', 'stating', 'networks']","Despite information technology emerging as one of the most powerful drivers of economy and a crucial means of communication and automation, network security in the country continues to remain in the doldrums.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/30/2001 0:00,,"PA-UNP talks break down Plan for fresh poll? Colombo, August 29 With the Peoples Alliance (PA)-United National Party (UNP) talks on priorities to end the countrys deepening political crisis breaking down last night, the government is reportedly planning to move a motion for the dissolution of Parliament and go for fresh elections. The motion is likely to be moved when the House meets on September 7 after a two-month prorogation. On the breakdown of the talks between the two main political parties, the opposition UNP today blamed the government for trying to create an unconstitutional position of a Vice-President for the incumbent Prime Minister, who does not even command a majority in parliament. Commenting on the collapse of the government-opposition talks last night, UNP media spokesman Karunasena Kodituwakku said the PA proposed the creation of a Vice-Presidency to accommodate the Present Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremenayake who needs to relinquish office to pave the way for another all-party government. There was general agreement on UNP leader Ranil Wickremsinghe taking over as Prime Minister, but the talks broke down on issues relating to what amount of power he should have and amendment of the Constitution to appoint Mr Ratnasiri Wickremanayake as the Vice-President. During the discussions that continued till late last night, the PA delegation indicated it could compromise on the executive Vice-President but insisted on at least having a ceremonial Vice-President. The UNP rejected this outright, saying that it was absurd for the PA to say it wanted to abolish the executive Presidency and at the same time propose a Vice-Presidency. The UNP also accused the PA of being unwilling to include other political parties, like the minority Tamil and Muslim Congress in the proposed national government. It called for immediate reconvening of Parliament, cancellation of the referendum which is now scheduled for October 18 and the setting up of five independent commissions. The UNP spokesman said the opposition participation in the talks was based on three primary principles and not for sharing the perks of office. The UNP said the government had now two alternatives. It could either invite the member who commands the confidence of the majority in Parliament to form a government or form a caretaker government with the support of all political parties and initiate the peace process before calling for the general election. The PA-UNP delegations discussed many other thorny issues during the past three days before the talks collapsed last night. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka today announced it was ready for a mutually agreed ceasefire with Tamil Tiger rebels ahead of peace talks and said it was considering a fresh invitation to the guerrillas to begin negotiations. There has been a re-assessment of policy on this matter and we are now ready for a mutually agreed ceasefire before talks, said Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar. A pre-talks truce will meet a key rebel demand which stalled a Norwegian-brokered peace bid, and signals a dramatic shift in the position of the government which until now had ruled out a ceasefire before negotiations began.

Following this the DTO immediately suspended one employee and also informed about it to State Transport Commissioner, Punjab. He said, I received the complaint from an anonymous caller that three applicants who failed in the test had been issued learners license. On verifying the computer record, I found that the complaint was true as the applicants failed to clear the test but stamp of pass was marked on the documents and the applicants were issued learners license. He said, As the contract for issuing these licenses has been given to a private company, so we have brought it to the notice of company and the company has assured us that they will take further action against the erring officer. We have also brought it in the notice of State Transport Commissioner, Punjab, for further action. When asked as if the license of these three applicants would be cancelled, the DTO said, For the time being we will not cancel their learners licenses. But before issuing permanent licenses to these applicants, their driving tests would be conducted under strict vigil. What is Tab test?

Beggars go to hills in summers! Anupam Bhagria Tribune News Service Ludhiana , June 13 Although district administration has started a campaign against beggars in the city and motivating them to stay at Shelter Home of Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, but many of the beggars have already moved to hills. It seems surprising but true that at the onset of summers many beggars moved to hilly areas. Requesting anonymity an officer said, A few days ago I visited a hill station in Himachal Pradesh and came across a beggar near a religious place who is usually seen near a religious place in the city. I asked him as if he belonged to that place. Listening to this the middle aged beggar replied, It gets very hot these days in Ludhiana. So every year I move here or any other hill station where I get enough to make my both ends meet. There are many beggars like him who follow this practice. Sources reveal that as summers set in, many of the beggars move towards hilly areas. Ram Kumar Verma, a city-based businessman said, It is true that these beggars follow the pattern of tribes. I am a regular visitor of a religious place in the city. Even I have seen that many beggars suddenly disappear in summers and come back in winters. Once I also asked a few such beggars as where they were during summers and got to know that they moved to hills. As they dont have any home so they keep wandering here and there depending upon the weather conditions. Meanwhile Rajat Aggarwal Deputy Commissioner, Ludhiana said, This pattern of beggars reflects that although they are capable of working but prefer to sit idle and spend life as it is. We have started our campaign against beggars as beggary is crime and we want to curb this practice. We will keep motivating them to stay at shelter home and help them in doing some work of their choice. We will plan out something for the beggars who are unable to do anything. Admn to begin drive against beggary Ludhiana, June 13 Temple committees and student volunteers of some city-based schools will be involved to create awareness against beggary in the city. This was decided today in a meeting held under the leadership of DC Rajat Aggarwal, Ludhiana. A few days ago district administration started a campaign against beggary in the city.

Teen pregnancies on rise: Experts Manav Mander Tribune News Service Ludhiana, June 13 The number of teenagers and young unmarried girls going for abortions has risen sharply in the city sparking concern among gynecologists over unprotected sex. The most worrying part is that it is not the only rise in the number of pregnant adolescents, but self-abortions and botched-up abortions too has seen an increase over the years. The availability of emergency contraception is being increasingly misused on a regular basis. Doctors confirm that school children seem to be open to physical relationships and the number of school girls coming to them with pregnancy queries has increased remarkably. A sexually active life at a young age leads to high incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STDs). One in 20 adolescent contracts with the infection every year, and half of all cases of HIV/AIDS is among the youth below 25. It may also lead to other problems in future, said Dr Gautam Sharma. Dr Zeenie Sharda Grin, obstetrics and gynecologist at SPS Apollo Hospital said, There has been a remarkable increase in the teenage pregnancies. Earlier, there would be one-odd case a month but now there has been a considerable increase. Most of them lie about their age and dress up in a mature way to hide it. Its only when I talk to them that I realise that they are quite young. The normal age of visitors is 15-18 years and they come when the patient is about four to six weeks pregnant, adds Dr Sudha Chawla a gynaecologist. I get two-three teen pregnancy cases a month that are in the age bracket of 16-18 years. These girls are from the educated class studying in reputed schools of the city. Till a few years ago, only one-odd case in three months would come up but now 4 cases come every month. These girls are so young and immature that they do even know the repercussions of the abortion they are going through. It is usually girls partner or friends who come along, said another city-based gynecologist who wished not to be named. A salesman from a chemist shop at Model Town tells, Boys as young as 16 to 19 years come to buy emergency contraception.In recent years, more than the number of pregnancies, cases of using incorrect contraception has gone up. This is a bigger problem than teenage pregnancy. Since oral emergency contraception is easily available, it is taken by teens regularly, which, even if taken once, can lead to disturbed menstrual cycles. After regular usage, patients come complaining of hormonal imbalance, added another city based doctor. Abortion with pill on rise With the easy availability of a pill that terminates pregnancy, surgical procedures have taken a backseat. But unlike emergency contraception, it cant be bought without prescription or taken without medical supervision. The abortion pill is available at for Rs 1,000. It cant be sold without prescription, but the law isnt so strict, so youngsters use it without medical supervision. Self abortions can be life threatening. An ultrasound before abortion is a must. Sex education is the need of hour The most viable solution to keep the youth aware of ones sexual health is to introduce sex education in the school curriculum at a young age covering the various aspects related to sex, reproductive health, pregnancy and family planning. If sex education is incorporated in the curriculum then there will be less exploitation of the young minds at the hands of internet and other distrustful sources. What the law says? By law, termination of pregnancy in a minor cant be carried out without a parent or guardians supervision. A boyfriend - adult or not - is usually not acceptable as a guardian. It has to be a parent or another legal guardian.",{},"['drug', 'tribune', 'fair', 'learners', 'young', 'india', 'test', 'license', 'ludhiana', 'chandigarh', 'singh', 'city', 'beggars']","He also said the police department is making arrangements to admit the drug addicts in drug centers to keep them away from drugs.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,8/30/2005 0:00,,"ARTICLE Turmoil in the BJP The party needs a charter for 21st century by S. Nihal Singh T O say that the Bharatiya Janata Party is in a crisis would be an understatement. It would seem that the party has lost its mooring and is undergoing a period of intense turmoil before it can re-invent itself or revert to its traditional constraining ideology. Mr L.K. Advanis remarks on Jinnah in Pakistan are now history, but look at the state of the party today. The party president has lost his moral legitimacy after being read the riot act by the BJPs mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. For a time, the second string of the party leadership was scrambling for the top prize. When it became clear that Mr Advani would leave the presidency at a less embarrassing moment, the would-be successors calmed down. The results for the party have nevertheless been little short of disastrous. Mr Yashwant Sinha chose to be vocal about Mr Advanis assessment of Jinnah without inviting an immediate rebuke, but when he dilated upon the inadequacies of the party Chief Minister, Mr Arjun Munda, in Jharkhand, he was taken off the panel of party spokesmen, with signs of little regret from the former Foreign Minister. Mr Advanis untenable position has, indeed, invited a rash of revolts from the states the party rules. Gujarat, simmering for a long time, came to the fore again, with dissidents led by the veteran Keshubhai Patel making high profile visits to Delhi. Ironically, the RSS icon and Gujarat Chief Minister, Mr Narendra Modi, supported his party president and was, in turn supported by Mr Advani against the dissidents. It was the RSS chief, Mr K. Sudarshan, who gave the appellation of prostitute to politicians. In Madhya Pradesh, the party chief minister, Mr Babulal Gaur, wears an uneasy crown, challenged as he is at various levels by his predecessor, Ms Uma Bharati. The stormy petrel that she is, she is apparently assessing her options before raising the battle cry again. Precariously, Mr Gaur has completed one year in office. Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, on his part, has made no secret of his aversion to Mr Advanis newfound love for Jinnahs secularism. And, in an extraordinary twist, the veteran BJP Delhi leader, Mr Madan Lal Khurana, baited his party president by first criticizing him and then seeking Mr Modis resignation. Not receiving an immediate reaction, he publicised the letter he had sent to Mr Advani to be served a show-cause notice, which took days to travel to him. Indeed, many of the prominent and not-so-prominent members of the BJP are bent on publicly ventilating their frustrations, to the discomfiture of Mr Advani and all those who hold the partys interests dear. It is a plague that is in danger of spreading unless drastic remedial measures are taken. The stock of the former Prime Minister, Mr A.B. Vajpayee, is not uniformly high, split as the party is on ideology. His support for Mr Advani averted an immediate crisis only to store up more trouble for the party, as recent events amply demonstrate. What has brought a party that prided itself on discipline and moral probity to its present sorry plight? It would seem that the party is trying to follow the example of the Congress in a fast forward mode. It was in power at the Centre for a brief six years but displayed a penchant for cutting corners and exploiting opportunities the Congress took decades to learn. And having tasted power in New Delhi, the BJP has been unable to reconcile itself with sitting on the opposition benches again. The RSS, for its part, was mostly content while the BJP was in power because its agenda was being furthered through the placement of its men and women, such as Mr Modi, in key positions, the promotion of a blinkered view of history and the new textbooks that would, over time, influence a new generation on the virtues of the RSS philosophy. There were other perks such as grant of land for Sangh Parivar institutions and introduction of courses on astrology in universities. Once the BJP was out of office, the RSS resented the streak of independence the party had developed by being less than enthusiastic in taking up hoary issues like Ayodhya and there was also the perception that men of the order of Mr Vajpayee were less than reverential to their mentor. Mr Sudarshans outburst against Mr Vajpayee and Mr Advani in a television programme, asking them to retire, was amazing. And for good measure, he let it be known that Mr Vajpayees tenure in office was not particularly distinguished, driving home his point on another occasion by praising Indira Gandhi for winning the Bangladesh war. The message the RSS wished to convey was clear: it was time for Mr Advani and Mr Vajpayee to go, in that order. What was tolerable when the BJP was in power was intolerable now. And the partys loss in the election was laid at the door of it having strayed away from its Hindutva norms. The problem for the BJP leadership was that if it reverted to its old postures, it would spoil its chance of returning to power in a coalition because it would not be able to win a majority of seats on its own. As it is, some of the constituents of the National Democratic Alliance such as the Telugu Desam are beginning to peal away. There is a deeper dilemma for the BJP. To think of Mr Advani doing a rath yatra across the country painting it red, as he once did, is inconceivable. Ayodhya is a tired political issue and although the BJP can raise the communal temperature if it wants to, it would not lead it very far. The basic question for the BJP is how it can become an established centre-right party without the baggage of espousing antiquated ideas of reviving a mythological India. And if it would decide to do so, can it survive as a political force without the dedicated volunteer force of the RSS, which has been a crucial factor in winning elections? The planned executive committee meeting cannot resolve this dilemma because a mere tinkering with the problem or declaratory statements will not suffice. The wise men and women of the party must sit together to devise a new charter while endeavouring to take more reasonable RSS men with them.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/23/2010 0:00,,"Health Notes Most hip fractures occur in elderly Tribune News Service Ludhiana, November 22 Dr Harpreet Gill, senior consultant and head, department of orthopaedics, SPS Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana, was recently invited as guest faculty at the advance technology symposiums on hip and wrist fractures held at Delhi. Gill shared the stage with the faculty from Australia, Japan, Medanta Hospital and AIIMS, New Delhi. The symposium provided an insight into the latest developments in the treatment of hip and wrist fractures and was attended by 125 orthopaedic surgeons from North India. Gill, said that the hip fractures were a major health problem in a developing country like India. The Indian population appears particularly vulnerable to the problem of osteoporosis and hip fractures. Risk factors for osteoporosis that have been described include female sex, low body mass index, old age, positive family history, early menopause, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor calcium intake and Vitamin D. Most hip fractures occur as a result of low-energy falls in elderly patients. Hip fractures are very dangerous episodes especially for elderly and frail patients. The risk of dying from the stress of the surgery and the injury in the first few days is about 10 per cent. If the condition is untreated, patient can have pressure sores and chest infections. With increasing life expectancy in Indians, the number of fractures is going to increase and these fractures can cause physical impairment and reduction in quality of life. Indian therapeutic device awarded Cytotron, a therapeutic device of Indian origin, has been awarded a cash grant of a quarter million dollars by the US government for further research. The grant is awarded to use Cytotron, as a stand-alone device to treat cancer and improve drug targeting and delivery through nano-permeabilisation. This grant provides long awaited validation and acceptance from key opinion leaders and medical fraternity in the field of oncology and orthopedics and several other disease indications. Cytotron is now poised for entry into Canada, America, Caribbean and Mexico, following the USFDA and Health Canada-mandated clinical trials. It already has the CE certificate necessary for entry into the European Union countries. QTDP grant will open up more doors to make the device and the treatment available in multiple medical institutions world over. Cytotron is a novel, patented therapeutic device, invented by Dr Rajah Vijay Kumar and his team at Centre for Advanced Research and Development (CARD), an Indian Technology company. Cancer occurs when cells that were at one time good citizens go hay-way and start behaving like terrorists. Cytotron uniquely combines radio frequency with instantaneous nuclear magnetic resonance, to safely yet effectively target and perform multi organ tissue engineering. The device helps a protein called p53 to kill the potential cancer-causing cells without the side effects found in conventional treatments for cancer. Dr. Harpreet Kaur Sibia, director, Sibia Medical Centre, Ludhiana stated that in 2006 Ludhiana became the first centre in the world to adopt Cytotron therapy after the clinical trials showed positive results. The potential of this technology is immense but progress so far has been slow due to lack of resources and the Indian government and organisations not being alert to new developments by Indian scientists. The mental block doubting anything that is of Indian origin is also very discouraging, said Sibia. Sibia said, This news is very exciting and encouraging to us. Our colleagues at Bangalore and the US counterpart have done a great job and we hope to contribute in whatever way we can to the betterment of cancer, arthritis, multiple sclerosis and other patients. The grant will help bring the technology a step closer to the patients. We hope that the insurance companies, corporate and the government will pay for patients opting for this treatment. We aim at bringing affordable health care to the citizens and to reduce death and suffering from life threatening and debilitating diseases,"" Sibia went on to add. Dental education programme A continue dental education (CDE) programme was held at Baba Jaswant Singh Dental College, Hospital and Research Institute, Ludhiana. Dr Nageshwar Iyer, director-hospital administration, Prof Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Maharishi Maarkandeshwar College of Dental Sciences and Research, Mullana, Ambala, and Dr. Neeraj Gugnani, professor, pedodontics and PCD, D.A.V Dental College, Yamuna Nagar, were the main speakers at the CDE. The guest speakers presented lectures on "" Career in Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Today"" and ""Early Caries Diagnosis and Intervention"" respectively. Managing Director, S Piara Singh and Principal, Dr DS Kalsi welcomed the guest speakers and thanked them for sharing their professional knowledge and clinical acumen with the faculty and students. Dr Neeraj Gugnani while elaborating his topic of presentation Early Caries Diagnosis and intervention said that, there was a paradigm shift in our understanding of dental caries as a disease and methods of detecting and monitoring it at early stages have also advanced significantly. Visuo-tactile detection of caries is no longer acceptable and there is s shift towards usage of more advanced techniques like fibre optic trans illumination (FOTI), electric caries monitor (ECM), quantitative light fluoresescence (QLF) etc. These new methods of caries detection also allow us to identify lesions that are amenable to early interventional strategies like remineralisation. The presentation focused on the usability of these newer caries diagnostic aids and the available methods of intervention. Dr Nageshwar Iyers lecture displayed the spectrum of health issues addressed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon today and the charm and aura associated wit the profession. He explained as to how the profession had grown from ""oral surgery"" to ""maxillofacial surgery"" to ""craniofacial surgery"" and to oral surgeons becoming a part of a team of ""head and neck surgeons"".

EDM, a staple of any dance-based environment, has garnered a fan base hardcore enough to perceive the genre nothing less than religion! That explains the myriad initiatives to turn listeners into converts. ""We thought of starting with a project through which we could promote EDM music in Chandigarh. While the music scene has evolved, there is still scope for growth. Given the percentage of youngsters we have, it should be much more popular,"" shares Saurabh Aggarwal, the brain behind the project Electronizm. ""It is a venture through which we have tied up with various institutions and venues to promote EDM gigs."" For instance, 107.8 FM Desh Bhagat Radio, where the music will be played starting at nine on every Saturday night. Bringing the music to listeners will be the trio of DJ RDG, DJ Sky3y and DJ Gary Vronski. ""We all love this music and that is why we are out to promote it,"" shares DJ RDG, who has been playing in the city for the past decade and whose music influences include the likes of DJ Paul Thomas, Mark Knight and DJ Jerome Isma-Ae. He adds, ""The problem with crowds here is that after a couple of drinks they want to listen to only their kind of music. We want them to be much more receptive to this genre."" Its a been here, heard, explored and did not get hooked onto scene with the genre. The love for a particular kind of music can only be inherited, but hardly ever cultivated. Moving on, a live gig starting at Ten Downing Street, Hotel Altius on the first Sunday of August, which is Friendship Day, awaits. Shares Saurabh, This is just the first venue; we will be moving onto other clubs and lounges in Chandigarh and several other open air concerts. We also have a tie-up with celebrity DJ artists, with two of the confirmed names being DJ Kash Trivedi and DJ Static. DJ Gary Vronski, shares a couple of observations on the city, ""I first came here in 2009 and think that the people here still need more awareness.

The story of the film revolves around the life of Hercules a tormented soul who walked the earth neither as a man nor or as God. He was the powerful son of God King Zeus. He received nothing, but suffering all his life. After the severe loss of his family, he turns his back on the Gods and finds solace in fighting bloody battles. Over the years, he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love for fighting and presence of death. These men and women never question where they go to fight or why or whom; just how much they will be paid! Now the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen, when they must train an army to become ruthless and blood-thirsty. Quite engaging Dwayne Johnson is rocking in the loincloth and he delivers exactly what any reasonable person reading that description of Hercules might expect. I am anyway a great fan of Greek Mythology and though this film pulls a leaf from Homers version of the mythology, it is interesting and engaging.  Karandeep Singh, student Gripping tale I really love the film. It is gripping till the end. The action sequences are realistic and fit well into ones imagination of those times, especially the character of Hercules. I think Dwayne has done justice to his role.  Nimarta Kaur, student Good story Its a very interesting film. I love the way Dwayne Johnson has acted in the film. Also, I love the storyline.  Rashmeet Kaur, private bank employee 22 Jump Street An action comedy film, directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, 22 Jump Street features Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Based on the 1987 television series by the same name by Stephen J. Cannell and Patrick Hasburgh, the film follows two police officers who are forced to relive high school when they are assigned to go undercover as high school students to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier. Nostalgic take It brings back the 80s nostalgia and offers the rowdy mainstream comedy with a surprising twists. I like the film very much!  Jagriti Lamba, student Well done I love the film. Its so funny and interesting too. I would advise everyone to watch the film.  Anu Sharma, student (As told to Amarjot Kaur) punjabi scope Dont take a panga! Jasmine Singh Paisa Pyar N Panga, this weeks Punjabi film, justifies every bit of its title. First, you spend your paisa (money) to watch the film with the thought of falling in pyar (love) with it, and once through the film, it will create a panga (problem) since you have to answer the question  who suggested you to watch this film! Directed by Virender Singh and written by the Ranjeev Verma, the film has either been inspired or creatively plucked here and there from the Hindi film Love key Liye Kuch Bhi Kareyga, directed by E Nivas. Despite this, the director couldnt do much justice. Filmmakers do get inspired, but like we have heard in schools all the time  nakal ke liye bhi akal chahiye! Given this, the director still has done whatever little he could do. Surprisingly, some of the dialogues of the film are pretty hilarious  read only some. The film has of course an ensemble cast with the Punjabi hunk, Gavie Chahal, Veer Vashisht, Karan Sekhon, who makes his debut with the film, Mukul Dev, Khusboo Grewal, Flora Saini and Richa. Yet another thing that the film has done is that it has dared to go ahead without the usually famous battery of comic actors. The humour, whatever little, that you find comes only from the actors. Actor Gavie Chahal has returned to Punjabi film after Pinkey Mogey Wali. Gavie is a versatile actor and in the film we get to see the comic side of him as well. The good-looking actor is watchable in the film. Karan Sekhon is quite a surprise element. He bares all, his abs and comedy skills. The actor definitely holds potential. Veer Vashisht, seen in the Punjabi film Burrah, has come a long way as an actor. A slight chiselling here and there is all he needs. Khushboo Grewal is a pleasure to watch, but given her character there is nothing much she could do. Mukul Dev whips up some comic moments, which are terribly painful to bear! Otherwise, there can be no better villain than him in the industry. Flora Saini is another beautiful face on Punjabi screen  only a pretty face and thats it! The film has a collection of songs, the first one actually appears the minute you have rested your back, the second follows soon for reasons best known to the director. The others come falling by, the reasons also best known to the director! The kidnapping episode is dragged way to long, something the editor could take note of. No wonder paisa and pyar creates a panga! jasmine@tribunemail.com The natural click Mona Snowcapped mountains, clouds over the hills, animals lazing around in the meadows and more are what 22 students of Dikshant International School, Zirakpur, have put up for display at Punjab Kala Bhawan-16.

Unless it leaves the public spaces and moves onto peoples homes, it is only a slice of history. While there is no need to go on an overdrive recreating master prints, one must find ways to make art a way of life. ""I have been painting from home since 2006; it is only recently that I decided to move onto commercial space with twin objectives. One was to ensure that there is a place to acquire affordable art and second is to provide a platform to people who would like to train in art,"" shares Alka Kalra, at the launch of her art studio-cum-training centre AK Studio at Mohali on Thursday. ""What makes this art studio stand apart is that everything here is hand-painted, right from dress ensembles, pottery to artifacts."" With several knick knacks, pots, miniature paintings, pen stands et al, there is an intention to bride the gap between the exclusive and affordable. The characteristic Dhaba Series finds space all over the studio  from a vendor frying samosas to the beauty of pans and kettles. There are ubiquitous landscapes and several other. ""A couple of landscapes are from my travels to Sikkim and other places by the sea. In one of the pictures taken by the beach, I have tried to depict the serenity of water."" Theres a fabric section trying to promote the concept of art that one can wear. ""In the fabric section, one can find hand-painted duppatas on Krishna series, with Rajasthani touch, on African tribal art and on flora and fauna. They are priced as reasonably as between Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500, so that whosoever walks in should end up buying something."" While it is an absolute no to replication of any of the classics or well-known works by renowned artists, customization is welcome. ""We can always custom-make paintings and landscapes. If somebody comes to us saying that they would like something like a farm scene for a certain size of wall that can always be done."" star track Shraddha injures herself Shraddha Kapoor is preparing for her next film which is ABCD 2. The actress is training hard for this film in which she plays a dancer. Shraddha has intensive practice sessions as she has to master various dance styles for this film.

However, its a strenuous move and she landed up injuring herself. Shraddha got a muscle pull and was in a lot of pain. She was immediately taken care of and is currently undergoing physiotherapy sessions."" ""She has been advised to take rest for a week at least. Shraddha has been working out and undergoing extensive training. She was dejected as she had to forgo her training for such a long period. She has a mapped fitness plan and has been trying to follow it to the tee but this recovery is important. However, even while resting Shraddha has decided to make most of her time. She has been watching dance videos of different forms and trying to understand the knack,"" adds the source. Her role in ABCD2 is very different from what she has done before. Its a very challenging role and she is getting a chance to learn a lot. She has been giving her 100 per cent to it. Shraddha is keen to get back on her feet as soon as possible so that she can get going with her training. Shraddha says, ""I guess it was a result of over enthusiasm which led to a partial muscle tear. I guess I have to be a lot more careful while rehearsing because it is very important to understand your body and how much you can push it. But I love dancing so much that Im praying this injury heals quickly."" I guess it was a result of over enthusiasm which led to a partial muscle tear.

Now the 46-year-old actor-comedian will be next seen in Akshay Kumar-starrer Entertainment. We catch up with him to talk about the film, his role and more... Tell us about your role... I play a lawyer who is supposed to protect dogs rights after his owner passes away. His owner has willed his entire property to the dog. I am the in-charge of everything, so everybody needs to come to me. It is a bit serious as well as comical. For me, it was a totally different experience shooting with a dog for the first time. The character is different from what I have done earlier. How was it shooting with a dog? It was scary as well as thrilling. I am not used to being around a dog and in the film Im very fond of dogs. So, I was scared that somehow I dont offend the dog or step on his tail by mistake. But luckily for me, everything went fine. Is the dog hero of this film? Definitely. He is no ordinary dog. Everything depended on him while we were shooting. If he wasnt in the mood, we wouldnt shoot and we had to wait. He even had an AC van to himself. So, you can imagine how we treated him on the sets. You have done so many movies with Akshay Kumar. How is he as a person? He is a gentleman and very disciplined. He still sleeps by 10 pm and gets up by 5 am. He doesnt drink or smoke. He is very strict about health regime. Being around him makes you admire that dedication. Your daughter is also into comedy. Yes, her name is Jamie. She recently started with Comedy Circus and I keep hearing good things about her. Some people even told me that she has overtaken me. It feels nice to hear such things. She is gifted. Do you feel that the industry has changed? The only thing permanent in life is change. And if one doesnt change with time then it becomes difficult to survive. But there is a limit to how much one can change. There are certain things that we have learnt from our seniors and those things will never change. Whats next? I finished shooting for a couple of films which will release soon. I am currently in talks for some roles. Ive cut down on films. Ive done so much work in the past that now I want to do less but good work.

It was an unintentionally funny incident. chatter box Tales of heroism While TV stars remain heroes in their shows, do they exhibit the same bravery in real life? Here are a few of your beloved TV celebrities, sharing their heroic moments To the rescue: Ruslaan Mumtaz I was stuck in a traffic jam in Lokhandwala market and I saw a drunken man attacking two women with bricks. They were shouting for help and the only one close enough to stop him was me, but I was in my car, driving. However, I couldnt see him continue his assault on them. So, I hopped out of my car and pushed the drunkard on the road. Believe me, I had to gather a bit of courage to do that. He actually started attacking my car with a brick, but I was satisfied that at least the women were safe. They quickly thanked me and walked away. And I too sat back in the car and moved on. I dont know what was it that helped me find the courage to do such a thing, but it was probably the thought that if it was my mother who was being attacked, I would have definitely expected someone to help if I wasnt around. Honesty pays: Bakhtiyaar Irani During our final exams in college, our professor caught me and my batch mate cheating, as the supervisor saw him exchanging a supplement. We were called to the principals office after submitting our papers. The principal informed my batch mate that he would have to repeat the whole year, as he was caught red-handed. My batch mate tried begging and explaining to the principal that he wasnt the one who was cheating, but his efforts were in vain. He then approached me with teary eyes and said he just couldnt afford to repeat the year as he was flying to the UK for his MBA and that his parents had already paid Rs 4 lakh as his admission fee. I realised that it was cruel of me to blame him for the cheating, when in reality it was me who tried cheating and had asked for his supplement. I finally gathered some courage, walked into the principals office and told him the real story. He found my bold deed of confessing quite pleasing and decided to let both of us go with a warning. Water saviour: Sumeet Raghavan When I was a 12-year-old kid, two of my friends and I had been to the Pransukhlal Mafatlal Hindu Swimming Bath near Churni road for an afternoon swim. One day, I saw an elderly man, in his 70s, going up and down at the deeper end of the pool trying to wave his hand. I deduced that he was probably drowning. Unfortunately, there were hardly any people around; the lifeguard too had gone for his break. My friends and I got out of the pool and ran towards him, one of my friends instantly jumped in the pool and tried dragging the old man out, but he was a little too heavy for a 12-year-old. I looked around and saw a few floaters kept in one corner. I immediately grabbed those and threw them in the pool and as planned, the old man held onto them as we pulled him out. It turned out that the poor old mans back had cramped, which immobilised him. All this literally happened within a matter of 30-40 seconds. At the end of it all, we were very proud of ourselves. No nonsense: Rajesh Kumar Once I was in Delhi and after my shoot at night, we were driving towards our hotel and my driver casually overtook a biker. After a few minutes, we realised that the biker was chasing us and he raced ahead of our car and stopped his bike. As a result, my driver too had to hit the brakes. The biker got down, dashed towards my driver and started slapping and abusing him. I saw this and got out of the car to stop that man. As soon as he looked at me trying to hold him back, he retrieved himself, fell on my feet and started saying, ""Bhaiya mujhe maaf kar do, galti ho gayi. Agar mujhe patta hota ki yeh aap ki car hai toh main aisa kabhi nahi karta."" He went ahead and gave my driver Rs 500 and was walking away when I called out to him and made sure that I put some sense into him. At the end, he genuinely apologised to my driver and realised that what he did wasnt right at all and confessed that he had had a bad day. At the end of it, I felt a sense of satisfaction.

Karan helps out Divyanka It is common for actors to be harassed by either the paparazzi, an anonymous fan or just about anyone. And this is not only outside their house or at public places, now they have started harassing stars on the sets! Recently on the sets of Star Plus show Ye Hai Mohabbatein, Divyanka, who essays the role of Ishita, played true to her character and decided to ignore an anonymous man who misbehaved with her.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,9/30/2002 0:00,,"COMMUNITY Plea to end caste quota Our Correspondent Bathinda, September 29 Mr Harbans Singh Sidhu, district president, General Categories Welfare Federation, while addressing a meeting of activists at Goniana Mandi, near here, late last evening said the present system of caste-based reservation was not in the national interest as merit was being ignored to promote the interests of a section of society. The members of the federation opined that as the present set up of caste-based quota promoted not the downtrodden but individuals of certain castes and compromised on quality and merit, it should be done away with. They pointed out that originally introduced for 10 years the caste-based discriminatory reservation system was being extended by the successive governments to gain political mileage. The activists said while the wards of the freedom fighters, who had played an effective role in the freedom struggle, were given the benefits of reservations only for three generations the caste-based quota was endless. They added that those in government service, even wards of class-I, IAS, PCS, IPS officers etc was given these benefits, even as they could not be classified under the downtrodden, Dalit, or depressed categories. The activists alleged that a large section of employees belonging to the general categories were feeling frustrated due to the present reservation policy. The lamented those who had joined the service along with them, in the same departments with the same set of qualifications had been made their officers, not because they were more competent  but because they belonged to the reserved categories. Mr Jaspal Singh Jassi, senior vice-president of the federation, said when some government employees were being given jobs and promotions only on the basis of their castes rather than qualifications it was worthless to expect efficiency, dedication and competence from them. He added that under the present set up, those who belong to the so-called reserved categories and had barely managed to get their degrees were being admitted in the government, professional colleges and were also given jobs, even as more qualified, talented and deserving candidates from the general categories were available. Mr Sidhu alleged that the present set up of caste-based quota was even discriminatory against the ex-servicemen, who had devoted the prime of their life in the service of the nation. He pointed out that while all children of the ex-servicemen were not eligible for availing the benefits of the services of their parents, there was no bar on the number of children of senior officers belonging to the reserved categories who could avail the benefits of reservation. He claimed that while as per the Constitution every citizen had been given the right to contest elections from their place of permanent residence, some of the seats had been reserved on caste basis, which prohibited those belonging to the general categories from contesting elections from such places, even if it was the place of their permanent residence. The people were being forced to elect their representatives from candidates thrust upon them, he alleged. Mr S.P. Goyal, finance secretary, of the federation, said the move to implement the Mandal Commission report should be dumped. Later, the activists of the federation urged the authorities concerned to dismantle the caste-based quota and demanded that poor students belonging to the general categories be given education and books free of cost.",{},"['reserved', 'castebased', 'reservation', 'tribune', 'federation', 'set', 'given', 'general', 'india', 'categories', 'quota', 'present', 'chandigarh']","They pointed out that originally introduced for 10 years the caste-based discriminatory reservation system was being extended by the successive governments to gain political mileage.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,12/4/2004 0:00,,"Indias twin hopes in film fest Amar Chandel Tribune News Service Panjim (Goa), December 3 Indias hopes of cornering honours at the 35th International Film Festival of India rest on two films, one English and one Marathi, which are the official entries into the Asian competition section. The first is Bow Barracks Forever. It is a bitter-sweet tale of a middle-aged Anglo-Indian widow in Kolkata, a city she hates, who manages to survive by brewing quality wine. Her sole dream is that her elder son will one day call her and her younger son over to London. The film revolves around several idiosyncratic characters who finally find the courage to stick together in their crumbling tenement. The cast includes Lillette Dubey, Victor Banerjee, Neha Dubey and Clayton Rodgers. It has been directed by Anjan Dutt who was launched as an actor by filmmaker Mrinal Sen. This is his second film after Bada Din (1996). Marathi entry Shwaas (A Breath) is the debut film of director-screenplaywriter Sandeep Sawant who has been active in Marathi parallel theatre for the past 15 years. He puts his masters degree in applied psychology to good use in this powerful film which has Arun Nalavade, Ashwin Chitale and Sandeep Kulkarni in the cast. An old villager (Nalavade) brings his seven-year-old grandson (Chitale) to the city to consult a doctor (Kulkarni). The child is diagnosed with eye cancer. The doctor suggests a severe treatment for the boy, which will result in lifelong blindness. The shaken grandfather tries to avoid the reality but is finally convinced. While the boy faces his fate with a smile, his grandfather has to learn many harsh but inescapable lessons about living life gracefully. Shwaas is also Indias official entry for Academy Awards, quite an honour for a debutant director. Sawant says the time has come to change the taste of Indian cinegoers who are currently bombarded with pure entertainment. A Shwaas Foundation has been formed for collecting funds for cancer patients. At the beginning of the screening of the film, Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikkar handed over a cheque for Rs 21 lakh to Mr Sawant. From tennis court to producers chair Ashok, the youngest of the tennis-playing Amrithraj brothers, has taken on some of the best players of the world during his forays into the Wimbledon, the US Open and Wimbledon in the 1970s. Now that he is into film-making, he says he is into the toughest terrain on the earth. His 50-odd films are not exactly top-quality stuff but as far as popularity is concerned they are way above the average. Five of his creations are being screened at the 35th International Film Festival of India here. These are Bandits starring Bruce Willis, Bringing Down the House with Steve Martin and Queen Latifah, Moonlight Mile starring Dustin Hoffman, Raising Helen with Kate Hudson and John Corbett and Walking Tall starring Dwayne Johnson The Rock. Talking about his experience in Bollywood and Hollywood, Ashok says in the former filmstars are the gods while producers and others figured way down the line. In Hollywood, it is the other way round. Here the film stars are chosen first, other arrangements follow while the story is hammered into shape last to fit this arrangement. Narrating how he got into the film industry, Ashok says while watching a public show once, Gary Marshall, top director of films like Pretty Woman, called him up on stage because Gary was a tennis fan. That made Ashok hooked to films and he struck gold with the Jean-Claude Van Damme starrer Double Impact in 1972. Once my foot is in the door, it is difficult to push me out, he emphasises. A few years later, Ashok was to hire Gary to direct his film.",{},"['sawant', 'gary', 'tribune', 'ashok', 'film', 'shwaas', 'films', 'india', 'way', 'wimbledon', 'marathi', 'chandigarh', 'starring']","Her sole dream is that her elder son will one day call her and her younger son over to London.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,11/9/2003 0:00,,"Social monitor Surviving the trauma of rape Swapna Majumdar A rape victim needs counselling and family support A staff nurse in a Mumbai hospital is raped by a peon. The dog chain used to bind her causes spinal injuries and brain paralysis. Two sisters, aged 11 and 13, are raped by their maternal uncle in Madhya Pradesh. A woman and her daughter, admitted to a hospital in Bihar, are raped by the doctor. The traumatised daughter commits suicide. A few months ago, a trial court in Delhi acquitted two persons accused of rape since the complainant was unable to present herself for cross-examination. The accused were let off because it was unlikely that the complainant would ever appear before the court to substantiate her charges. The victim, the court was informed, had died. And the dead tell no tales. In India, where a rape occurs every 30 minutes, psychological and mental trauma coupled with physical abuse and societal pressures lead many rape victims to end their lives rather than relive their humiliation in court. NGOs that work on the issue of sexual violence say that the incidence of suicide is high among rape victims. There are innumerable cases in which a victim of rape is unable to appear before a trial judge to prove her allegations. Although the reasons for their non-appearance are manifold, the root cause can be traced to the trauma associated with rape. At the same time, there are some victims who stand up for their rights and fight for justice. But the low rate of success in bringing rapists to book and the prolonged and, more often than not, embarrassing and crude court proceedings act as a major deterrent. However, while many victims of rape shy away from legal battles, the need to live with dignity is paramount. While the struggle to make the streets, the home and the general social environment safe - from sexual abuse, assault and rape - for women and girls must continue at all levels, including legal proceedings, there is also a need for a specific response to the traumatised victims of rape. In this context, could an adequately and sensitively structured organisation set up with representatives from womens groups, civil society organisations and the government, provide the much-needed succour, hope and financial support for women and girls who have survived the trauma of rape? With the psychological support that is urgently required for rape victims, could such an organisation step in to prevent and minimise the possibility of suicide? Could it provide critical financial support during the period the woman or girl is unable to decide her course of action even after having filed a complaint with the police? Also, could it help her in fighting for justice and in ensuring that she is able to continue to live with dignity? The agonising case of a young woman, who was ostracised by her parents after she was raped and put in a home for the mentally ill, underlines the need for such psychological and financial support. Often, such support could make the difference between life and death, particularly if the family of the victim is not supportive. In this case, when the girl returned home after a brief stay in a home for the mentally ill, her parents were keen to get rid of her and so they married her off. But later, when her husband learned of her trauma, he severed relations with her and barred her from meeting their one-year-old son. Left to fend for herself since her parents had already washed their hands off her, the young woman made an attempt to put her life together by working at a beauty parlour. She also wanted to save some money so she could fight for the custody of her son. However, she was sacked a few months later, when her employer got to know about her past. Now, at the end of her tether, the girl has said that she will make herself available as a sex worker since she has already been treated like one. ""Yes, there is a need to have a body which can provide financial help along with other services,"" says Jyotsna Chatterjee of the Joint Womens Programme (JWP) in Delhi. ""Our organisation has found that to convince the girl that she is not guilty and to persuade the family to accept her as a victim of violence, is a long and continuous process. This is primarily because it takes a long time to overcome the trauma. So, to prevent the girl from being victimised by her relatives, measures like this could be helpful. The government must be an active participant and provide the requisite funds."" Sayeeda Hamid of the Muslim Womens Forum - and a former member of the National Commission for Women (NCW) - echoes similar sentiments. ""The government cannot shirk its responsibilities. This body can only work if it has teeth and funds. I think that giving financial support can be an interim measure to help the victim tide over the difficult period. It can empower women to break their silence if they have some financial cushion to fall back on. I think NCW should float a proposal like this because its mandate is to help women in distress."" In the past, although NCW has intervened in some rape cases and provided succour to the victim, this has been sporadic. As far back as 1994, it was hoped that rape victims would get speedier justice after the Supreme Court gave NCW the responsibility of evolving parameters to assist rape victims. These parameters were to take into account the pain, suffering, shock as well as loss of earnings due to pregnancy and the expenses of childbirth if this occurred as a result of rape. The parameters, however, have yet to be evolved. Constituting a new body - and one that is centralised - to help victims of rape is not the most effective way of looking at the issue, according to Kalpana Viswanath of Jagori, a Delhi-based resource centre for women. Viswanath thinks that while financial assistance for victims of rape would be useful, their needs have to be addressed in a holistic way. Deciding on how much money should be given, how it is disbursed and to whom, would throw up several complex issues. ""If some of the existing womens groups got together and took it upon themselves to help victims of sexual violence for their counselling, legal and financial needs, and in accessing financial assistance, it could be more useful. This group could tie up with banks for micro-credit loans, and persuade corporate bodies to help out with employment."" Past experience has shown that the time taken between police investigations and the case being produced before the trial court is dependent on many factors. These include the identity of the perpetrator, his social and political connections, the sincerity of the police and most important of all, the perseverance and patience of the victim. If the victim has no family support, who can she turn to during this period of crisis? Even if she wants to seek legal assistance, how can she expect to pay the cost involved? And what if she just wants to start afresh, move to a new city? How and where does she access monetary assistance? Financial assistance during the period of crisis is clearly crucial. However, it cannot work in isolation of a sensitively devised strategy that includes counselling, psychological support over a considerable length of time, and legal aid.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,2/27/2010 0:00,,"Nomad clusters hub of crime, says police Sandeep Rana Tribune News Service Dehradun, February 26 Although the Dehradun police agrees that the nomads having their temporary abode in citys roadside, parks and grounds particularly the Parade Ground and the Gandhi Park have anti-social and criminal elements among them, it is unable to remove them. Several people with makeshift camps can be seen at the Parade Ground and the Gandhi Park. Even on the city roadsides, such people can be seen with small shops, huts and temporary shelters, which besides giving an ugly look to the roads of the state capital, also gives rise to the petty crimes, including chain snatching, theft and even prostitution. City Superintendent of Police (SP) Jagatram Joshi agreed that there were suspected elements who had been found involved in crime in the past. However, he lamented that the police couldnt do much since several drives were held to remove them, but they again came back. Shedding light on one such major crime incident the SP said a retired employee of the Survey of India Department was murdered in September and the persons involved were from these temporary makeshifts at the Parade Ground. The victim and the accused used to play gamble in the Parade Ground and the former was killed by the latter in a bid to snatch the little money, which he had reportedly won in the gambling. A few days ago we proposed them to get shifted to the Ranbasera (night shelter) but they refused. They dont even have fear that the police might take them to the lock up, said Joshi. Sources added that gambling and other illegal activities were galore in such places in the late evening, but any checks were hardly conducted there. However, sub inspector of the Dalanwala police station Vimal Tamta said, We do shoo away these people in the evening but they are found back there by the morning. We are doing everything at our level but the MDDA also has to do something in this regard. If it raises walls around the area, then even we will also able to tighten the noose around them and will let them come there. Tamta admitted that involvement of these people was found in petty thefts like stealing of iron roads, but there hadnt been any case of chain snatching involving them came to light. The attitude of the police and the MDDA towards these places is a cause of concern, the authorities must come up with a solution, opined an elderly resident of Dalanwala.

Ronaldo gets Ballon d’Or,PARIS:Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon d’Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.,Tribune News Service,2016-12-14T02:03:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"PARIS, December 13Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon d’Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.Ronaldo is one short of the record tally of five awards won by Barcelona’s Argentina forward Lionel Messi, who was second with the pair having taken the first two spots since 2011.“For me it’s a great honour to receive my fourth golden ball. The emotion is like for the first one, it’s a dream come true again. I never thought in my mind to win four times. I’m so happy,” said Ronaldo, who won the award in 2008, 2013 and 2014.“It’s probably the best year of my career collectively, with Real Madrid and Portugal. Real are used to winning titles while Portugal had never won a major title so this (Euro 2016) title is special. I don’t want to lack respect to the Champions League but the title with Portugal is a level above.” The Ballon d’Or, which merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award from 2010-15 to create the FIFA Ballon d’Or, returned to France Football magazine this year. A total of 173 journalists voted but not national team coaches and captains who were also polled for the FIFA award.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Cut aboveFrance and Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann, who lost to Ronaldo’s Portugal and Real in the Euro 2016 and Champions League finals respectively, took third place. Uruguay forward Luis Suarez was fourth and Brazil’s Neymar fifth, giving Barcelona three players in the top five.Ronaldo was a cut above the competition, though. He scored 51 goals in 54 games for club and country, albeit his lowest tally since 2008, claimed another Champions League winners’ medal and lifted the European Championship trophy. Ronaldo limped off midway through the first half of July’s Euro 2016 final, which Portugal won 1-0 after extra time against hosts France, but he hobbled back onto the pitch to celebrate his country’s first major soccer title. Six weeks earlier, after a fairly anonymous performance against local rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout to hand Real their 11th European Cup. It was, therefore, hard to see past 31-year-old Ronaldo for the winner of the Ballon d’Or, even if the trophy is designed to reward individual performance rather than team results.Taxing questions spoil Ballon d’Or winRonaldo feels unable to celebrate his fourth Ballon d’Or award as much as his previous triumphs due to recent allegations of tax evasion. The European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) media consortium reported in early December that Ronaldo, and several other clients of soccer agency Gestifute, had used tax havens to handle tens of millions of euros in earnings. Gestifute denied the accusations last week. Ronaldo expressed his disappointment at the timing of the charges against him.“Of course it (allegations) has spoiled it a little bit. I would be lying if I said it hadn’t. I’m not a hypocrite,” he said. “I wasn’t pleased. The whole process in itself is hard and not only for me, but also for the people alongside me: my family, my son, all those who work with me. All that irritates me because I try to do things correctly, be transparent.”“I don’t have any reason to lie. What came out troubles me. Because it’s not true. The lie is troubling. I have done things correctly. There are a lot of innocent people in prison. And I feel a little bit like that. You know you have done nothing wrong, and they say you have done something reprehensible. No one likes that,” he added.Villarreal beat Atletico Madrid 3-0 Villarreal thumped Atletico Madrid 3-0 to vault into the fourth place in La Liga, dropping them to sixth. Adding to Atletico’s misery, midfielder Tiago and goalkeeper Jan Oblak left the match in the first half with injuries. The hosts took a 1-0 lead in the 28th minute when Manu Trigueros took advantage of an error by Tiago and beat Oblak with an angled shot. Oblak set up the home side’s second goal with a poor clearance that ended up at the feet of Jonathan Dos Santos, who hit the post once before putting away his own rebound to make it 2-0 in the 38th minute.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,12/31/2007 0:00,,"Flashback  2007 Slew of schemes for women empowerment, children Tribune News Service Chandigarh, December 30 The Haryana government today claimed to have taken a number of measures to empower women and enhance nutritional status of children during the year 2007. A press note issued here today said new initiatives taken by the women and child development department included constitution of village-level committees of women and their convergence with panchayati raj institutions (PRIs), formation of sakshar mahila samooh (SMS), facility of micro-credit for SMS from Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (RMK), construction of mahila shakti sadans and awards for improvement in sex ratio. The government had set up 6,157 village level sub-committees of women to facilitate implementation of programmes pertaining to development of women and children. Such committees were declared as sub-committees of the gram panchayats under Section 22 of the Gram Panchayat Act, 1994 and were thus made a part of the PRI system. These committees were given functions, funds and functionaries to carry out their activities. A sum of Rs 6.66 crore was released to the committees in 2007 for awareness generation activities and to meet other expenditure. It was also decided to dispense with centralised system of procuring the ready to eat food items for the beneficiaries of the ICDS and entrust the responsibility of preparation of food items to women self-help groups or mothers groups under the supervision of the gram panchayats. The scheme aimed at generating employment for about 75,000 rural women. The government enhanced the financial norms from Rs 2 to Rs 3 per day per child and Rs 5 for severely malnourished children per day and from Rs 2.50 to Rs 5 per day per mother and adolescent girl with effect from January 1 so that protein and calories requirements as per norms of the ICDS scheme could be ensured to all beneficiaries. These rates are highest in the country. The SMS, consisting of a group of educated women in a village, was slated to lend the necessary resource support to the gram panchayat and its sub-committee for effective discharge of the functions assigned to them. The SMS generated awareness on key issues of sex ratio, literacy, universal elementary education, health, nutrition, opportunities for economic empowerment for women, hygiene sanitation and environment and schemes run by the government for women, children and village community. A total of about 6,000 SMSs had been formed. The Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (RMK) agreed to recognise SMS as an eligible NGO for the purpose of promoting micro-credit and undertaken the responsibility of training of members of SMS for this purpose. Haryana Women Development Corporation (WDC) was the nodal agency in this regard. An agreement to this effect was signed between the RMK and the Women Development Corporation (WDC) on January 3. SMSs would access micro-credit from RMK directly. The RMK would advance credit to the selected SMSs at a rate of 8 per cent per annum. These SMSs in turn could lend at any suitable rates of interest from 8 to 18 per cent on reducing balance to other SHGs in their villages. It was on the occasion of International Womens Day falling on March 8 that Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda announced that mahila chaupals would be constructed in all villages of in phased manner. He approved the proposal with the amendment that chaupals would be known as mahila shakti sadans and equipped with library, furniture, computer and stationery. The government decided to construct buildings for anganwadi centres without contribution of panchayats or village community during 2007-08 in villages with 50 per cent or more Scheduled Caste population. It was also decided that the districts showing improvement in sex ratio and securing first three positions in the state would be given awards at district level every year to the tune of Rs 5 lakh, Rs 3 lakh and Rs 2 lakh, respectively. To reduce the number of malnourished children in Haryana, nutrition awards were instituted at district level. During the year 2007, the award of Rs 2 lakh, Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50,000 were given to Faridabad, Hisar and Rohtak districts, respectively, for obtaining first three positions. In order to encourage rural girls for pursuing higher education, the scheme of awards to rural adolescent girls was started and 384 girls were given awards for which Rs 5.76 lakh was spent. To encourage women for proper rearing of their children, especially girl children, the scheme of best mother award was started. Under the scheme, three mothers having at least one girl child were selected for 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes. As many as 2,346 mothers were given awards during the year 2007.",{},"['tribune', 'rs', 'lakh', 'awards', 'given', 'india', 'women', 'mahila', 'scheme', 'children', 'rmk', 'chandigarh', 'sms']","The government had set up 6,157 village level sub-committees of women to facilitate implementation of programmes pertaining to development of women and children.

Redefining national security in complex new world,"In his avatar as a futurologist, Henry Kissinger in his thought-provoking book “World Order” draws a few conclusions relevant to India’s national security situation. Firstly, Kissinger notes that the world is spinning out of control with no designated caretaker.",Lt Gen SS Mehta (retd),2015-01-20T01:51:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"In his avatar as a futurologist, Henry Kissinger in his thought-provoking book “World Order” draws a few conclusions relevant to India’s national security situation. Firstly, Kissinger notes that the world is spinning out of control with no designated caretaker. Secondly, he predicts that India will be the fulcrum of the 21st century world order because of its cultural cohesiveness. Thirdly, he notes with his patented asperity that foreign policy cannot be held hostage to domestic policies. Lastly, he notes the dichotomy that while economic structures are rapidly globalising, political structures remain enslaved to the Westphalian nation-state construct which is becoming increasingly irrelevant.An explanation is warranted here. The Westphalia Treaty came about in 1648 after incessant war drove the degutted participating states to sign up for what was formalised as ‘peace by exhaustion’. It also led to the creation of a politico-strategic structure identified as the nation-state. Over 350 years later, the global knowledge explosion underscored by the ubiquitous, all-pervasive social media and IT-driven technology platforms providing instant, affordable communications and convergence has raised serious questions about the continued relevance of the Westphalian model. Upgrading Westphalian model Alvin Toffler got this phenomenon right in his “Third Wave” analogy of the 1980s when he listed the everywhere (globalisation), nowhere (cyberspace), and out there (outer space) paradigm as the greatest turning point of the modern era. Driven by ‘techno-rebels’, this Third Wave has given a new meaning to national security by underscoring the increasing ease and anonymity of asymmetric threats to it by state and non-state actors and the resultant challenges now faced by the citizen. Thus, it is fair to say that national security will increasingly signify the security of the nation and its citizenry. This emerging space-cyberspace-instant communication continuum has totally diluted the historic idea of nation-states with national boundaries. Under the new dispensation, the ‘thing’ to be protected more than national borders is the individual of that country. Failure to undergo this transformation will render the idea of national security irrelevant if it isn’t configured as ‘all-embracing’. Thus, unless every citizen across gender, age, profession and religious persuasion feels to be an intrinsic part of the security ‘idea’ of that nation, part of its national security spectrum, the concept will become unstuck. Thus far, national security always meant two things: Scanning the security environment for likely threats and placing the military hardware needed to counter the perceived security threads. The soft side was either ignored, or glossed over as a sufficiently essential component of national security. Wisdom has now dawned that national security is actually the sum total of national defence, economic security and human security. All three add up to lend new meaning and substance to what comprises national security. As far as economic security is concerned, former Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Dr Subir Gokarn pointed out that the Indian economy has displayed an inability to sustain high growth rates for long periods of time partly because it failed to deal with structural barriers on time. Left unattended, these barriers will emerge as serious existential threats to national security.  While national defence is well understood, the mediums of conflict have enhanced. Besides the traditional dimensions of land, water, underwater and air, we now have space and cyberspace. While earlier threats were stand-alone, cyberspace has now networked all threats, adding exponential value to each. This has forced us to understand and use cyberspace for national security. In the domain of human security, India faces six threats: Water, energy, health, education not resulting in employment, environment and technology. This combination of traditional and non-traditional threats coupled with the availability of affordable and enhanced mediums of anonymous asymmetric capabilities has complicated the security scenario. To deal with this synergistically, there is a need to design a unique architecture which concentrates on policy direction and monitors implementation. New security architecture On the architecture of the National Security Commission, we would be well advised not to go by the name. Whether it is the National Security Council, National Development Council or known by another name, it should have expertise to devise and articulate policy to suit the changed conditions and emerging challenges. Policy when clearly enunciated will provide the basis of a National Security Doctrine which, due to the rapidly changing environment, will always remain a work in progress. However, it will be the quality of available expertise and the design of the scaffolding, besides the wisdom to ‘add on’ or delete ‘redundancies’, that will remain critical.While placing due emphasis on the contribution of citizens to be partners in national security, it is axiomatic that we make policies that enable India to transit from a ‘labour arbitrage economy’ to a ‘knowledge arbitrage economy’. If we do not make this transition, we will remain the patronisingly labelled low-end labour force of the world: A condition which emphasises the insecurity and low self-esteem of citizens. Whether we upgrade ‘skilling’   using the ‘Make-in-India’ or ‘Made-for-India’ pathways or both, we will have to make this transition speedily empowered by well thought-out policies.   On the nuclear front, we are still using the grammar and lexicon of the Cold War. We have to devise our own grammar and lexicon. For instance, I am not convinced why we are not in a position to say that ‘threat of use is first use’. Sure, this usage is debate-worthy because it has complex dimensions, but is still the operating part of the new lexicon we should be using.  In the emerging understanding of statecraft, even seasoned campaigners like Kissinger have begun to see the wisdom of Kautilya’s “Arthashastra” formulations. He opines that the treatise represents practical statecraft, not philosophical constructs. Maybe it is time for us to reinterpret Kautilya’s teachings. Media and perception managementFinally, a word on the media — a key component of the national security architecture. While it has instant, mind-boggling information available to it, such access erodes perspectives and rapidly generates flawed perceptions. Often, and this happens cyclically on the TV media, while perception is at the goalpost, truth is still putting on its socks. That is where the print media remains compellingly relevant. This is because print provides a balanced perspective. Readers begin to understand the context of an occurrence that often results in a change of perceptions. However, the IT explosion has compressed time because even as the old story is being deciphered, another story or group of stories is breaking out. This reduces the importance of perception, leaving one notable causality: The truth.  The printed word, however, has the advantage of ease of access and archival recall. It isn’t a blip that comes and goes and will always be relevant. There is much more that goes into news gathering and its analysis and sifting of wheat from the chaff. The relevance of the print media cannot, therefore, be trivialised.  Concluded",{},"['policy', 'media', 'remain', 'cyberspace', 'national', 'world', 'india', 'threats', 'wisdom', 'security', 'complex', 'redefining']","Thus, it is fair to say that national security will increasingly signify the security of the nation and its citizenry.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,5/15/2003 0:00,,"SAVE SUKHNA Catchment area must be acquired Survey the entire catchment area of the lake and acquire every inch of the land. Part of the catchment comprising eroding areas fall in Haryana. This should be acquired and handed over to UT for proper management. Once the acquisition is complete intensive soil conservation and afforestation measures should be taken up. Previously erected check dams and other soil erosion works have become ineffective due to siltation. Removal of sand and silt through mechanical means and Shramdaan can continue. Wet dredging can be implemented if economically viable. A seminar should be organised and a series of recommendations should be considered by the Chandigarh Administration. C.M. Sethi, Former Chief Conservator of Forests & Chief Conservator of Soils, Punjab Have three-tier forest vegetation E VER since its completion, the Sukhna Lake has been continuously facing the problem of siltation and by now has lost about two-third of its water storage capacity in spite of several anti-siltation measures. Having worked on the ecology of Siwaliks for more than a decade now, I suggest that Kansal, Nepli and Ghareri tributaries of Sukhna choe traverse high gradient hillock thus carry high loads of silt because of fast down flow of rain water. For checking silt flow there is an urgent need to construct several check dams in each of the down stream flows of the tributaries. The catchment area of the lake has fairly good vegetation but the present need is to have at least 3-tier forest vegetation of indigenous species of tall trees, medium trees and shrubs with lots of ground cover in order to have almost zero level rate of soil erosion. This can best be down with involvement of the local population settled in the catchment basis. Dr Yadvinder Singh Patiala Motivate youngsters We should try to motivate our young generation to save lake. it can be done by giving lectures and by organising seminars regarding water resources in schools and colleges. Plant vegetation in the catching areas to prevent soil erosion which will help us to prevent silt from entering the lakes. Alkesh Sharma , Baltana Invite private sector Open up the lake for private sector and permit water sports, besides house boats for those wanting to stay there. The private party will bring in resources to prevent silt forming in the lake. The other side of lake can be connected with a ropeway and then developed with the beautiful landscaping, musical fountains, colourful lights and camping sites. Ashish Lamba , Chandigarh Sukhna is a diamond The Sukhna Lake is the jewel of City Beautiful, to be more precise. It is like diamond studded necklace in the neck of bond. It is a place to relish for people from all walks of life. Apart from all efforts put in, by administration, volunteers and social organisations to desilting it, more concrete steps are required to generate dedicated feeling among masses people to contribute in what so ever manner to save and keep live the most prominent water feature of City Beautiful. Let us pledge to save Sukhna, lest we may not lost this precious treasure. Rajinder Parshad , Chandigarh Follow example of Venice To keep our Sukhna silt free we can take the example of Venice where water transport is quite common. In Venice, silt and mud are removed regularly, and for this purpose, a dredging machine is used to remove the mud from the base of the canals. The machine which has two hydraulic arms is fixed on a large boat and the arms are lowered into the water. One of the arms is fixed with electronic rotating blades which help stir the stiff mud so that it can be sucked by the suction pump which is attached to the second arm of the machine. The suction pump is attached to a large tube which takes the mud or silt outside the waters so that it can be taken away to be used for some other purpose. The whole process can be expensive but the administration will have to raise some funds by various means. Anuraag Kapoor , Mohali Get fresh survey The entire catchment area needs to be got surveyed and a detailed contour plan prepared. Erecting of check dams at the narrow gorges of the deep creeks during the dry months be undertaken thereafter. Since these dams are not a permanent solution silt ejectors of the type already constructed on the UBDC hydel channel in Punjab, be provided upstream of these check dams and the lower layers of water carrying the silt be disposed off far away from the catchment area through the tunnels. MP Gupta , Civil Designs Engineer (Retd.) , Panchkula Make panel of engineers Additional measures to desilt water entering the lake are necessary such as, vertical filters, silt excluders, silting tanks and check dams. Most suitable measures can be suggested after full knowledge regarding the type & quality of silt flowing in, topography of the catchment and the area around the lake. Engineers of Punjab and Haryana Irrigation Departments & Central Water Commission have dealt with such problems. A small panel of them (Serving/Retired) may be asked to give advice after thorough consideration. Raising water level in the lake will add to the water depth available and extend its life but will not prevent silting up of the lake. HL Sharma , Chief Engineer (Retd.) Deptt. of Irrigation, Govt of Punjab Needs organised, effective steps In the light of processes of erosion and drainage patterns this serious problem urgently needs organised and effective short-term and slow long-term measures. This essentially involves constructing low-cost rock-fill and earth-fill check dams on the in-coming streams to withhold sediments and regulate water flow, coupled with dredging or desilting operations. While the latter essentially includes large scale afforestation in the entire catchment area which specifically involves growing varieties of grasses, bushes, shrubs, small and large trees. The additional maintenance and periodic environmental measures cannot be ignored, such as, removal of excessive growth of weed sand introducing varied forms of fresh-water. Dr DS Arora , (Geologist), Chandigarh Innovative method I have an innovative method which can prove helpful. ""We have to dig a deep pit near the dam (near Saketri) and put an iron pit (non-rustic). It should be inserted at such a depth that it is below the normal bed of mud in the lake. The mud thus accumulated in this iron pit can be easily scooped out and this giving way to more silt falling into this pit. Deepak Bahl , Chandigarh Make best efforts The heat is increasing the water is evaporating and the lake is getting dry day by day. People from all over the world come to see this lake. I just want to say that whatever happens this lake should not get dry and it should remain in existence. We the people of Chandigarh should make our best efforts to save it. Ayush Jairath , Chandigarh Raising level is impractical This is a very important and crucial issue to be deliberated upon. Today, the existence of Sukhna Lake, having tourists attraction, seems to be in danger. The step to save Sukhna Lake by way of raising the crest level of the radial gates of the regulator can prove to be fatal and hence, there is utmost need to keep in mind the pros and cons of this action. The raising of crest level of radial gates of the regulator in a bid to enhance the present water level by 3ft, by and large, seems to be impractical, as the concrete walls may not be able to near the excess weight. This action can pose serious problems in the future. VK Puri , Chandigarh Create no mans land A nearby rivulet can be used as an alternative site by developing it permanently to transfer the water of Sukhna. For dredging the silt every alternative year and earmarking the surrounding area of 3-5 kms as ""Reserve Area"" where afforestation should be adopted. Remedial measure are to stop environmental pollution in the surrounding villages. To enhance the life span stop yatching competitions. Create no mans land upto 3-4 kms which will improve fauna culture, a natural habitat. Sham Lal K , Chandigarh Is lake designer to blame? The designer of the lake who was an outsider was not familiar with the fact that all the plains of Punjab are due to formation of this silt coming from the hills from the time immemorial. The silt can be reduced by increasing jungles in the catchment area. The Babbar grass should be planted to reduce erosion. Small dams in the choes will reduce the velocity of water in the rainy season. Adhoc measures like removing silt or sand from the beds is not a permanent solution for saving the life of sukhna lake. Baldev Singh Hada , Mohali Reserve water from Kajauli A small percentage of water supplied from Kajauli may be reserved for Lake. Pump it through 10 inch diameter pipeline approx. into lake for few days in a month to maintain desired level of water in lake, as already suggested by me, to Chandigarh Administration in May, 1988  which made several National and International rowing meets possible in Chandigarh. Construct small water reservoir at the bed of the Ghaggar river at suitable height and make necessary water flow through pipeline lines into the lake, simply by gravity. Excess water may be made to flow to remove silt from lake-bed. Gurbakhsh Singh Mann , Chandigarh Take remedial steps fast The Administration should take immediate remedial measures to check the slow death of this wonderful gift to the city. It is not only necessary but also important to grow more trees as well as special grass, which will help in holding the soil and will also check the silt to flow to the lake during monsoon season. Apart from this, modern techniques to remove the silt from Sukhna bed both manually and mechanically should be employed with the active voluntary participation from the general public as well. Kishore Kumar Sharma , Chandigarh Ensure adequate water supply Multiple planning of the Government of Punjab and Haryana and also the cooperation of the people to save the Sukhna lake target. Adequate water-supply is assured through Shivaliks mountains and new canal networks have been created such as the Rajasthan canal and Bhakra Nangal canals networks. if the inflow system is improved the Sukhna lake would be assured check silt flow. There has been a steep and steady need for plantation in the catchment area. Vikas Grover Build check dams Deforestation, faulty-agricultural practices and over grazing have lead to soil-erosion. It should be checked by building check-dams and construction of terraces on hill-tops. Planting of trees can also check the process of soil-erosion. Also multipurpose project is such a scheme which is carried out to fulfil a variety of purposes. For example irrigation, generation of electricity, flood-control, fish-breeding Neeru Gupta , Chandigarh Build speed breakers A multi-pronged approach is needed to arrest the problem of its silting. The preventive measures include: building of check dams at appropriate locations, aggressive and sustained afforestation drive in the catchment area, declaration of as much catchment area as possible as reserve forest to prevent any building activity in that, and creating artificial speed breakers at appropriate locations in the rivulets and nullahs to break the speed of flow of water thus disabling it to carry the silt downstream. Artificial speed breakers could be made by casting irregular shaped concrete blocks of suitable size. Lt Col Bhagwant Singh (Retd) , Mohali Call foreign agency It is a matter of concern which calls for evaluation by some foreign Agency having adequate experience of rain management. The removal of silt from the lake bed, mechanically or manually or even the redesigning of regulator gates for increasing the reservoir capacity cannot be permanent solution. The solution lies only in the effective control of silt movement at the place of origin. Jagdish Lal , Panchkula Call in the Indian Navy Best possible solution to Sukhna problem is to seek the help and advice of the Indian Navy which is well equipped and is a capable arm of defence forces which can provide much needed solution to Sukhna problem. S.K. Kaushik , Lt-Cdr (Retd) , Panchkula Soil stabilisation is needed Man has always played havoc with nature in the name of urbanisation. Degradation of Sukhna lake is a result of widespread deforestation due to explosion of human and live stock population in its neighbourhood, expansion of crop and grazing land, construction of roads along the terrain. Measures like construction of check dams and retaining walls to reduce the inflow of silt into the Sukhna Lake during rainy season besides dry and wet dredging are only symptom specific and are not going to help in a big way to cut the source. The problem can be arrested by taking prompt afforestation measures by planting compensatory trees, bushes and revegetion on step slopes so as to increase the green cover on the nude land. In addition to above soil stabilization measures will have to be taken which may include polymer, bituminous and chrome-lining grouting. Dr S.K. Aggarwal , Director Academic , Punjab Board of Tech Education and IT , Chandigarh. It requires a series of steps A series of measures must be undertaken to save the Sukhna Lake. Afforestation, construction of wired check dams in the catchment area and removal of silt can be some of the remedial steps. The silt movement should be stopped for its original place. Effective steps must be taken to lower the speed of rain water in the Shiwaliks which will reduce the soil erosion. Mehakinder Singh , Chandigarh Shramdaan a photo session Drying up of the lake is not a new topic. At the start of every summer Sharamdaan is started. The UT Administration is not serious. The show of Shramdaan started more than two decades ago by ordering Government Employees to be present at the Sharamdaan. Big bosses attended the show for photos in the media. Have a fool proof plan and keep extra budget for this and work should go through-out the year rather than have it only in summer. Purchase heavy and sophisticated machinery to engage full fledged staff for working through-out the year. G.K. Chopra, Chandigarh No more shramdaan A photosession on the banks of a canal will be an appropriate word than the Sharamdaan a farce being organised by the over enthusiastic entrepreneurs to save Sukhna Lake. Managing the feeding rivulets and desilting the lake are the specialised jobs and cannot be done by Shramdanees. If all these people and others are really interested, I suggest that those who have some experience in the desilting and managing the feeding rivulets they should register their names for undertaking this operation and others who do not have any experience about the same should contribute as per their capacities so that the needed persons and material can be hired for doing this job. S.B. Sharma , Chandigarh Wet dredging the only solution Wet dredging is the only solution. There is no point in delaying it by another 10-15 years. Raising the crest wall by 2 feet is a temporary and unsafe experiment and will create similar problems later. The 16000 trees that we talk of saving will die as soon as the water level is raised by 2 feet. Instead, cutter-suction type dredger should be used which has electro-hydraulic system and the mouth pipe can be increased upto 15 meters. This same wet-dredger is being used efficiency by BBMB on Beas Satluj Link Project, Sundernagar. So, lets be fair with our job and make some concrete and everlasting decision to save our beautiful Sukhna Lake for diminishing. Sanjay Verma , Panchkula Sukhna is in danger Today, the life of the lake is in danger because of reduction in its depth and purity day by day. This is due to large amount of silt deposit and waste during monsoon seasons. Soil erosion deforestation, sedimentation are among the main reasons while the most distress part is that we are also responsible for the damage caused by the lake by throwing eatables and polythene wrappers in to it. To save the heart of Chandigarh a well planned strategy and appropriate steps are required to clean the lake. Technical and Mechanical equipment, guidance from experienced and qualified Engineers and Consultants may be taken in this regard. Narinder Shukla , Chandigarh Have outlets at lower levels Outlets in the dam need to be at lower levels. During the time of heavy inflow, these outlets are operated to drain-off silt laden water. To prevent the in-flow of silt and sediments into the lake. preventive measures, such as provision of control bunds, checking of gully formation by providing small embankments, afforestation, grassing and control of grazing in the catchment area of lake for controlling the sediment in-flow in the lake, should be taken up at top priority. All these methods need to be accomplished by a variety of manual, mechanical and hydraulic methods. J.K. Arya , SDO Irrigation, Punjab One authority should maintain it The word lakenormally excites of image of something bright and beautiful, but the word Sukhna invokes the image of a patient suffering from an impossible disease. Recourse should be taken to the best expertise available from anywhere in the world. This dithering by the authorities must stop. One authority whose working should be as quite as the lake itself should be incharge. The hand of the artist should be invisible. Dr A.P. Sharma , Panchkula Result -oriented approach needed The silt that has developed over a period of time in the lake bed is making the lake endangered. The authorities should first look at the root cause of the copious amount of silt deposition. If it cannot stop completely then at least control it to bring the lake out of the danger zone. The check-dams have to be improved and increased in number. Rain water should be controlled and a proper outlet from the lake should be developed for drainage. There has to be result-oriented approach and no one should throw any plastic material, bottles any other garbage into the lake as it binds the silt in the lakebed and ultimately pollutes it. The responsibility has to be shared right from the authorities to the common man to preserve our own priceless lake. Mohit Thakur , Panchkula Increase breadth of rivulets The bed level and breadth of the rivulets carrying rain water to the lake should be increased. Sedimentation check points enroute be created with sand bag barriers so that the silt settles down on the way (about 200 to 250 metres away from the lake) and the minimum quantity of silt flows into the Lake. Steps to widen the breadth of Lake towards Kaimbwala village, which has narrowed, should be taken through proper planning. In the first year desiltation was started near the entry gate through Conveyor Belt installed with the assistance of BBMB. Cant it be undertaken again? To save Sukhna by increasing the depth is a challenging task to test skill of the engineers. Joginder Singh Bhogal, Chandigarh Do not litter Despite the authoritys endeavour, to keep Sukhna clean, it is tough to prevent people from littering the place. Messages like ""keep Sukhna clean"", ""Do not litter"" et al, repeatedly appear along the path. However, these fall flat as visitors still litter the lake with polythene, wrappers etc which may turn lethal for the lake. Sumit Gulati , Chandigarh Save the lake at all costs The accumulation of silt in the Sukhna is causing serious threat to its existence in the coming years. Deforestation in the catchment area of lake is a problem which should be checked. Increasing the level of water by making ponds an installing of silt excluders is required as it is not a natural lake but a man made lake. Soil erosion from nearby Shivalik hills also causes danger to the lake which brings more and more silt towards the lake. Dredging of silt with machines is another measure required to be taken to increase the depth of lake. Sukhna is not only a lake for city people but it is pride of city. Sukhna should be saved at any cost by proper co-operation of Administration and residents of city. Swaraj Arora , Chandigarh Select a solution This lake started to choke in its initial years due to tremendous siltation, it lost about 70 per cent of its original storage capacity. Then the Chandigarh Administration started sharamdan. I am myself one of the regular Sharamdanis and have been awarded by the Save sukhna lake society in 1992 and 1995. First question is how to remove the silt that has already piled up. Secondly, how to minimise the entry of silt. For the first problem, afforestation, mechanical desilting operations, wet dredging and shramdaan should be vehemently followed. Jagdish Kumar , Retd. Principal Control flow of water excess Removing of silt every year is not the solution yet it is a remedy. The silt comes to the Sukhna from the Shivaliks with the heavy flow of water during rains and there are no means to de-silt that water. The silted water is allowed to come in huge quantity and the access is also allowed to go out leaving behind the silt in the Sukhna. This must be controlled by making silt trap structures like silt-excluders and by construction of wired check dams. Afforestation- heavy vegetation on the Shivalik hills will also solve the purpose and stop siltation. Arun Goyal , Chandigarh. Plant shady trees The inflow of silt into the lake is due to deforestation in the catchment area in the Hills. Due to deforestation the land is fully exposed to rains, the soil is eroded and flows into the lake. The best method is to avoid silt in flow is by plantation of shady trees like in dense type forests. These trees will prevent direct contact of rains on the land and thus avoid erosion of the soil. In addition to it Ipomia ( Pahari Aak ) needs to be planted in the path of flow of rain water and slopes of the hills which will restrict erosion and in flow of silt. Rabinder Sharma , Ambala City Form expert committee To Save the Sukhna lake the problem of water level must be tackled immediately and on top priority. Water should be stocked or preserved in such a way that it becomes a watershed in the history of management of lakes. Services of specialists , if needed, must be requestioned. An expert committee should be formed to have an acceptable solution in the interest of preservation of the lake. The lake must be preserved as such because it is source of solace for visitors, who visit the lake.

"The Tribune, Chandigarh, India",,,4/8/2014 0:00,,"District Magistrate Purushottam launches anti-encroachment drive in Dehradun Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 After getting a rap from the High Court for adopting a lackadaisical attitude towards the removal of encroachments in the city, the district administration sprung into action and launched an anti-encroachment drive today. A team led by District Magistrate-cum-Mukhya Nagar Adhikari BVRC Purushottam removed encroachments from Clock Tower till Dilaram Bazaar.

Giving details of the plan chalked out for making the state capital encroachment free, Purshottam said the city had been divided into four zones. The drive carried out today covered the first zone. The drive has been carried out following the instructions of the High Court. Earlier, the court commissioner had conducted a check of the area. In the coming days encroachment will be removed from the Chakrata Road, Darshan Lal Chowk, ISBT, Paltan Bazaar and Tehsil area, he said. The officials have already instructed and issued notices to the erring shopkeepers and the businessmen for removing the encroachments. However, the shopkeepers who have not complied with the notice will be issued challans, he added. Those who were part of the drive included: Pradeep Kumar Rai, Navneet Singh, Girish Gunwant, Banshidhar Tiwari, Mohan Singh, Harshvardhan Mishra and PD Pandey along with several others.

Blood donation camp marks World Health Day Tribune News service A blood donation camp being organised at Max Hospital in Dehradun on Monday. A Tribune photograph Dehradun, April 7 To mark World Health Day, Max Super Speciality Hospital (MSSH), Dehradun, in association with the State Blood Transfusion Council, Uttarakhand, and the Red Cross Society, Dehradun, organised a blood donation camp today. Students from Gyani Inder College and doctors from the hospital also donated blood. The hospital also organised a lecture on vector-borne diseases. Speaking on the occasion, Dr RK Tondon, department of transfusion medicine, MSSH, said any spike in dengue cases immediately catapulted the demand for platelets. The normal number of platelets in blood is 1.5 lakh to 4 lakh and blood transfusion is required for dengue patients when the platelet count goes below 20,000. In an endeavour to generate awareness about blood donation, we organised the camp.

Reports about the celebration of the festival were received from various parts of the state, including remote and far-flung border areas.  TNS Mussoorie BJP hails partys manifesto released in Delhi Tribune News Service Mussoorie, April 7 The BJP workers in Mussoorie who were glued to their television sets while the election manifesto 2014 of the party was being released in Delhi, although after much delay, hailed it as vision document that would take the country forward in the right direction on the path of development in the next five years. On the other hand, the Congress workers reacting to the manifesto released by the BJP termed it as a distant dream and mere eyewash and full of divisive policy that could endanger the secular fabric of the country. The former president of Municipal Council, BJP leader from Mussoorie OP Uniyal, hailing the manifesto said that it was a document prepared after detailed discussions and contained a vision to take the country on the path of good governance and development in the next five years. He further said that the manifesto touched all the issues related to housing for the poor, health, economic progress and ways the government will go forward in providing employment for the poor. Uniyal, being critical of Congress, on the other hand has only believed in advertising its manifesto but not implementing it. The manifesto released today by BJP was an honest attempt to bring the country on the path of development. However, the Congress leaders in the town termed this document as mere eyewash. Anuj Gupta the Youth Congress, president from Mussoorie, said that the manifesto was just a bundle of lies and the nefarious designs of dividing the people by including the clauses such as construction of Ram Janma Bhoomi temple and uniform civil code have been included which was dangerous for a secular country like India. He further said that BJP was promising the moon to the innocent voters of the country but the people were gullible, and  I would give a befitting reply in the Lok Sabha elections by opting for Congress once again and rejecting the divisive policies of BJP.  The social activist Pradeep Bhandari, being critical of both Congress and BJP, said that the election manifesto released by the various parties had lost their relevance. Most parties promise stars and moon during the election but when it comes to implementation they have readymade excuses for not doing so. Every political party promises moon at election time but after the elections, such documents only bite the dust in the party office with the average voter remaining ignorant in the matter. Comparing the manifesto of Congress and BJP, Bhandari said that the Congress promises a new right to health along with creating 100 more jobs for the youth. However, it has failed to deliver on its promises made during the previous elections, thus putting a question mark on the relevance of such documents. On the other hand the BJP, in its manifesto, released today promises to curb inflation, increase employment, entrepreneurship and bring back black money in foreign accounts and tackle policy paralysis but the party has not fulfilled such promises in the past, said Pradeep Bhandari. Madan Kaushik vows to work for victory of all BJP candidates Puts an end to rumours of his defection Sandeep Rawat Tribune News Service Haridwar, April 7 Seeing state BJP vice president Madan Kaushik remaining inactive during the last fortnights election campaign, since his MP candidature was sidelined to pave way for former CM Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank as party candidate from Haridwar Lok Sabha, the party state units decision to make him sub coordinator of the state election campaign committee will surely go in favour of Nishank. By entrusting him the major responsibility of election in-charge for all five parliamentary seats of the state, the party high command made it sure that his services are utilised and rumours of his defection to Congress are also put to an end. Since day one when on March 15, Nishank was named party candidate from Haridwar seat, fear of infighting was looming large for the ex-CM,as Kaushik supporters came out in the open against the ticket allocation. Kaushiks absence during the election campaign was hurting prospects of Nishank as a large number of legislator supporters either were remaining absent or were not actively taking part in the campaign. Madan Kaushik since then remained confined in his house alienating himself from all party activities. He did not even attend party election state in charge Uma Bharatis meeting, which forced Nishank to personally convince Kaushik. State BJP president Teerath Singh Rawat also paid a visit to Kaushiks Khanna Nagar residence, which made Kaushik attend a road show of Nishank .But thereafter Kaushik again remained invisible with a leaked audio tape cornering him into a controversy in which he purportedly urged party workers to cast for Bahujan Samaj Party as he had been denied ticket for the second consecutive time. State Election Commission has served a notice to Kaushik in this regard, though in his reply the legislator alleged editing was done on his voice to malign his image. Two days ago Nishank called on Kaushik at his Khanna residence, where both the leaders had a closed-door meeting for 45 minutes. Party sources said that it was herein that Nishank offered Kaushik a bigger role in the party as state coordinator of BJP election campaign committee. Today Madan Kaushik refuted rumours of his joining Congress while speaking at his residence. Kaushik made it clear that his differences over ticket issue is a thing of the past and now he will work as dedicated party worker for all the five party candidates, including Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, from Haridwar. The three-time Haridwar city legislator said that due to Narendra Modi wave the party is sure to win all the five parliamentary seats of the hill state, Pauri Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal, Almora-Pithoragarh, Nainital and Haridwar.  Every party worker and voter wants BJP at the helm so that Modi can become prime minister of India and change fortunes. So, it is our duty to work hard to ensure victory of all BJP candidates so that Mission 272 plus is achieved. Congress ruled for 60 years, now it is time that Modi be given 60 months to give development-oriented, corruption-free governance,  he added. He also termed the speculations of his joining Congress, resigning from city segment and contesting on Congress ticket against Nishank as baseless and being spread to malign his image by Opposition. While Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said that he did not want to contest elections, it was the decision of the party high command to field all three CMs from the state as the party wanted all five seats from Uttarakhand. ""Kaushik ji is a seasoned politician and understands the complexities of the need of the hour.His experience will now be utilised along with Munna Singh Chauhans in all the five Lok Sabha seats of the state,which will ensure victory for the party,""said Nishank on the sidelines of addressing a public gathering. Left workers convention on April 10 Tribune News service Mussoorie, April 7 The Left parties will organise a convention of party workers in Mussoorie on April 10 to seek support for Shiv Prasad Deoli, the partys candidate from the Pauri Garhwal Lok Sabha seat. This was decided at a closed-door meeting held between the executive committee members of the CPI and the CPM here yesterday. CPI secretary Devi Godiyal told mediapersons the decision to support Shiv Prasad Deoli was taken unanimously at the meeting. He added the party workers would support Deoli. He said the people of the country were fed up with the Congress and had made up their mind to oust the UPA government at the Centre. On the other hand, the BJP was focusing only on Narendra Modi, thus revealing that the two parties were the two sides of the same coin. Godiyal said the country needed a party that was secular and did not indulge in corrupt practices. Women complain of inadequate representation in polls BD Kasniyal Pithoragarh, April 7 Women in Champawat district have expressed resentment over inadequate representation to the fairer sex in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections. They complained that every political party wanted the votes of women, yet none of them were willing to give adequate representation to them. Kamal Devi, a resident of Lohaghat, said there was not even one women degree college or women hospital in the district. Another women said all parties wanted women to attend their public meetings in large numbers. However, the same enthusiasm was not reflected while ensuring that enough number of women represent their respective parties . When asked which party they would vote for in the ensuing elections, the women said the party that was capable of checking atrocities on women, providing infrastructural facilities for the fairer sex like hospitals and educational institutions and that would raise voice against the menace of liquor that was ruining their domestic life would be their top choice. Gita Joshi, a homemaker and resident of Champawat, said,"" We want adequate representation of women in the organisational set up of all political parties. Mahila Samakhaya Champawat unit in charge Bhagwati Pandey said despite the worshipping of a woman as devi, society had failed to restore their dignity and a number of women faced violence in one form or the other everyday. Male members of Parliament have also failed to do anything concrete in this direction,"" said said Bhagwati Pandey. While Tulsi Sharma advocated the opening of more women hospitals in the district, Gita Joshi said more educational institutions should be opened for women as only education could make a difference in this direction. CPI (M) holds roadshows Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 Campaigning ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Prasad Devli, the Communist Party of India (M) candidate from the Tehri constituency, held a road shows in various parts of the state capital. Urging the voters to support the party in the forthcoming elections, Devli said that both Congress and BJP had the same ideology of supporting business tycoons and corporate houses. Both the parties have failed to address the problem of the people who voted them to power. The deterioration of the country is due to the devastative policies of both the parties, he said. The people of Uttarakhand are well versed with the  corrupt practises  of both Congress and BJP. Both the parties are not an option for each other. This time the people should choose CPI (M), a party that has listened and resolved their grievances since the last 35 years, said Devli. In yet another public meeting organised at Kanwli, Comrade Vijay Rawat said that the policies adopted by the Congress and BJP has given birth to widespread corruption, inflation and unemployment. Those who were part of the meeting included Arjun Singh Rawat, Anant Akash, Babita, Meenu Dogra, Suji Chahaun and Sahadullah. UKD (Airy) to contest all five seats Our correspondent Pithoragarh, April 7 The vote bank of the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) that lost recognition due to its failure in getting the required percentage of votes in the last elections is set to be divided as both the factions of the party, headed by Trivendra Panwar and Kashi Singh Airy, have fielded candidates from all the five Lok Sabha seats in the state. Kashi Singh Airy faction of the UKD today announced to field Amar Prakash and Bhuwan Joshi from Almora and Nainital respectively while Jayprakash Aggrawal, Ajay Raj and DD Sharma will contest from Tehri , Pauri and Haridwar seats respectively. ""We are contesting the election on the issues of making Gairsain as the permanent capital of the state, providing unemployment in hill areas and rehabilitation of the disaster-hit,"" said Dr Narayan Singh Jantwal, convener of the UKD ( Airy) campaign committee The Panwar group has fielded former Pithoragarh zila panchayat chairperson Ranjana Devi from Almora, Chaudhari Vijay Pal Singh from Nainital, Sohan Pal Singh Panwar from Tehri, Anoop Negi from Pauri Garhwal and Yogi Rakesh Nath from Haridwar. ""We had received 16 applications for the five Lok Sabha seats. We have tried to give representation to all castes,"" said Virendra Mohan Uttarakhandi, chairman of the UKD (P) parliamentary board. Harak Rawat likely to be Cong candidate from Pauri CM away to Delhi to finalise candidates for remaining three seats SMA Kazmi Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 The Congress is likely to field state minister Harak Singh Rawat from Pauri Garhwal. Earlier, the party was contemplating fielding Lt Gen Gambhir Singh Negi (retd), a former Commandant, Indian Military Academy, against BJPs BC Khanduri. However, Harak Singh Rawat has reportedly agreed to fight from Pauri Garhwal. It is also expected that Saket Bahuguna, son of former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, will contest from Tehri Garhwal. Earlier, there was a tussle between Chief Minister Harish Rawat and Bahuguna on the seat. Harish Rawat wanted Bahuguna to contest from Tehri Garhwal as he was considered a stronger candidate than his son Saket. However, Bahuguna wanted his son to contest from the seat. Suspense continues on the Haridwar seat which was represented by Chief Minister Harish Rawat. Earlier, it was expected that Renuka, wife of Harish Rawat, will be the party candidate. However, now rumours of fielding a senior Central leader from the Haridwar seat are doing the rounds. According to party sources, resentment among various senior leaders has led to the delay. Harish Rawat has left for New Delhi to finalise the candidates for the remaining three seats Before going to New Delhi for consultations with the party high command, Harish Rawat compounded the confusion by stating that a member of his family would be the last choice from the Haridwar seat. However, he admitted that the delay was against the partys interest in the elections. Already, the BJP candidates had finished the first round of their campaigning in the state. Over 1 lakh govt employees have potential to tilt the balance Neena Sharma Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 Uttarakhand state government employees have the potential to tilt the balance in favour of the party that has delivered big on the promises aimed at the welfare of the employees. In that sense over one l lakh employees and 80,000 teachers are expected to tilt the scales in favour of the party that has fulfilled their demands and the Congress government seems to have come good on the expectations of this section. Now at the time of voting, it remains to be seen if the employees redeem the goodwill in the form of votes in all the five parliamentary constituencies.  Every political party promises the moon to woo the employees and the ruling Congress Party in Uttarakhand learnt a hard lesson in 2012, when its government was brought to its knees by the striking employees who wanted reservation in promotions to go. Ignoring the agitation launched by the state government employees against reservations in promotions proved costly for former CM Vijay Bahuguna in 2012, whose son lost the by elections from Tehri,  said Jay Singh Rawat, senior journalist and political analyst. At that point of time, the angry state government employees had threatened to teach Congress government a lesson and the results were all there to see. Learning from the mistakes, the Bahuguna government quickly mended fences with the employees. It went ahead and announced a status quo on the issue of reservation in promotions by appointing a one-man commission to look into the issue, 10 per cent DA to the employees and then went ahead and issued directives for restructuring of the state secretariat staff, which in one move led to the creation of 22 sections and around 235 posts.  The employees are already reaping the benefits of these announcements and have no reason to grudge. This move together with the hike in DA endeared the Congress government to the employees,  added Rawat. Political analysts say over one lakh employees working in the state government utilities and the secretariat and also around 80,000 teachers have a penchant for voting en-mass and could play a big role in these elections. Doon DM fails to turn up for review meeting in Mussoorie SDM takes stock of development projects Tribune News service Mussoorie, April 7 SDM Ramji Saran Sharma took stock of the development works in absence of the DM, Dehradun, during a review meeting held at municipal council premises in Mussoorie today. SDM Mussoorie said that the DM was supposed to take the meeting but had to cancel it due to other prior engagements in the district. The issue of installation of traffic lights at Picture Palace as discussed in the previous meeting cropped up first where the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) Executive Engineer Shyam Mohan Sharma displayed his helplessness at installing the traffic lights due to the model code of conduct in place in the state. He further said that the traffic lights can be placed only after the tendering process which could take more than two months to materialise. The residents also apprised the SDM, Mussoorie, about the menace of stray dogs that have resulted grievous injuries to people in the past one year and demanded immediate respite from it through concrete action.SDM Mussoorie directed the MC officials to begin the exercise of sterilisation of the stray dogs without any delay. On the issue of street vendors the social activist Megh Singh Kandari said that the new law enacted by Parliament on street vendors should be taken into consideration while implementing the policy of identification of the spot from where the street vendors can earn their living. BP Bhatt, the trade union leader, said that the town could not do without taking into account the interests of the labourers and workers serving in various commercial establishments in the town. The SDM Mussoorie also discussed the ways to implement traffic plan prior to the tourist season to streamline the flow of vehicles during tourist season. The social activist Ajay Uniyal said that the municipal council should waive the fee at the two Mall Road barriers to provide relief to the local population here. In response, SDM Mussoorie said that he would be consulting all stake holders before chalking out any policy in the matters discussed here. The issue of drinking water supply also cropped up in the meeting where the spokesperson of Mussoorie Hotels Association, Sandeep Sahni, resented the blame game exercise being carried out by two concerned departments, namely electricity and Jal Sansthan, even before the start of the tourist season. He requested the SDM to sort out the matter in order to ensure adequate drinking supply in the town. The issues of solid waste, management, tourism and renting of municipal council properties etc were also discussed in the meeting but no decision could be reached due to absence of the officials from concerned departments in the meeting. The residents of the town aired their dissatisfaction at the absence of the officials from such important meetings, rendering the whole exercise futile by calling such meetings. The CO, Mussoorie, Jaya Baloni,EO, Muncipal Council, Azhar Ali, and others were present on the occasion. Student leaders defend their supporters caught cheating in examinations Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 Student union leaders in colleges should protect the interests of students but at DAV PG College in Dehradun, they are busy saving their colleagues caught cheating during the ongoing annual examinations. A couple of days ago, some students were caught cheating in a BCom exam and were handed over to the police. However, the police had to release them after issuing a warning owing to the pressure exerted by some student leaders. DAV college Principal Devendra Bhasin said student leaders exerted undue pressure on the college management after their supporters were caught cheating in exams. We have experienced in the past that student leaders try to pressurise the college management to protest their supporters,"" Devendra Bhasin said. However, the president of the DAV PG College Student Union, Siddharth Rana, said,"" I do not support the students who use unfair means in exams and the college should take action against such students,"" Over 100 students have been caught cheating this year and their case reports have been sent to the Unfair Means Cell of Garhwal University. The university will decide the future course of action,"" said Devendra Bhasin.

Public reps meet CS on delay in road construction in Jaunpur Tribune News Service Mussoorie, April 7 Public representatives led by MLA, Dhanaulti, Mahavir Singh Rangad, met the chief secretary of the state government over the issue of delay in the construction of roads in Jaunpur region at his office in Dehradun today. The MLA Dhanaulti Mahavir Rangad speaking to The Tribune said that he along with the affected villagers raised the issue of delay in the construction work for the two roads, Masrana-Kimoi and Thatyur Kempty, that has been pending due to the apathy of various concerned departments for the last past 60 years, forcing them to live under immense hardship here. He said the chief secretary must direct the officials to seek environment clearance from the Ministry of Environment for these two roads without any further delay and end the woes of the villagers permanently. Rangad further said that the CS flayed the officials for not pursuing the matter effectively and keeping it pending all these years. Rangad demanded from the government that for the road falling under Rajaji National Park, the wildlife Acts be amended in such a way that the bottlenecks surfacing in the whole process are removed so that the project can begin without any delay in larger interest of the villagers. The DFO Mussoorie Dheeraj Pandey, who was also present in the meeting, said that the proposal for Masrana-Kimoi has been sent to the state wildlife board but as no meeting of the said board has been conducted in the past six months, the matter was still at the pending stage. Speaking about the other road construction project he said that the proposal has been sent to the nodal officer who will be sending it to the Ministry of Environment for further clearance soon. It is worth mentioning the villagers of the area had called for boycott of Lok Sabha elections if their demands were not met. Docs can play important role in preventing cerebral palsy Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 Though there is no cure for cerebral palsy, a congenital disorder in children, it can be managed through regular therapy and medication, this was said by Dr BKS Sanjay an expert orthopaedic surgeon, at a seminar on Monday. The focus of preventing CP is in alleviating or minimising risks and repairing brain cells to restore function, said Dr BKS Sanjay.

Paucity of space delays setting up of referral centre in Doon Neena Sharma Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 The paucity of space has delayed the setting up of the state referral centre for the disabled. The centre was envisaged five years ago and aimed at providing different kinds of medical facilities to the disabled under one roof. The Social Welfare Department was allocated around Rs 36 lakh to establish the state referral centre with the help of the Health Department . The Department of Social Welfare was to provide the state-of-the-art equipment to the hospital earmarked by the Department of Health and then entrust the responsibility of running of the centre with the hospital. But, Doon Hospital, which was earmarked for the centre, refused to provide space for the centre due which the matter was put to rest. We have now asked the Chief Medical Superintendent of Coronation Hospital to provide space for the centre at the hospital, said S Raju, Principal Secretary, Social Welfare. The allocation of space at the hospital is proving to be troublesome. ""We have a limited space and cannot meet the specifications for the state referral centre, which will have a physiotherapy and a testing centre for the disabled. During a discussion with officials of the Social Welfare Department, we were told that the funds could only be used to purchase equipment and no extra construction could be carried out. The matter is still under consideration,"" said Dr Bharti Rana, CMS, Coronation Hospital. Many a times, the disabled and several social activists had demanded the setting up of a state referral unit in the past. ""The establishment of the referral centre has taken a long time. We have to set up such units at the district-level and then aim at providing other health services to the disabled,"" said Anuradha Mohit, Director, National Institute of Visually Handicapped (NIVH).

Ex-servicemen for rollback of excise duty on liquor in CSD Tribune News Service Dehradun, April 7 The Dehradun Ex-Services League has urged Chief Minister Harish Rawat to rollback 20 per cent hike on excise duty levied on liquor available in CSD. In a press note issued here, league president Brig KG Behl (retd) said the ex-servicemen had been demanding the rollback of the hike for long. The hike was effected to reduce the rates of liquor in civil by reducing 20 per cent VAT on liquor and increase 20 per cent excise duty to generate more revenue. The purpose was to check the smuggling of liquor from the adjoining states, where the rates were less. However, the fact that the increase in CSD rates will again lead to smuggling was not probably considered, which is happening now,"" he added. It is requested that the increase be rolled back to normalise the situation. It has generally been noticed that the officials concerned do not pay any attention to people until they take to the streets and protest.
