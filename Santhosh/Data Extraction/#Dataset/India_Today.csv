One of the most successful ways of treating addicts is Alcoholics Anonymous programme,Today the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) has grown into an institute of national repute and is the only one of its kind for treating alcoholics.,,2014-01-27T16:19:47+05:30,India Today,"Aversion therapy: effective Aversion therapy: effective When Shanthi Ranganathan, a Madras housewife, decided to set up an exclusive centre for the treatment and rehabilitation of alcoholics five years ago, many people dismissed her efforts as the desperate actions of a grief-stricken wife. Her husband, an industrialist, had just died from alcoholism and Shanthi recalls: ""People thought I was crazy. They could not accept that alcoholism could be cured, and doctors warned me that it was a disease of only relapses and remissions."" But Shanthi was determined. She did a course in the US on the treatment of alcoholics and started a centre in her sprawling home on the quiet Santhome High Road in Madras.Today the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) has grown into an institute of national repute and is the only one of its kind for treating alcoholics. Given the excellent cure rate of almost 60 per cent, the annual inflow of patients has gone up from 62 in 1981 to 320 last year.Before the centre was established, there were hardly any treatment facilities for the countrys three million alcoholics, most of whom were admitted to the general wards of hospitals and treated for symptoms like jaundice or hallucinations. The centres success lies in the fact that it offers treatment for the basic problem of alcoholism. It first admits patients to a nursing home for withdrawal symptoms like hallucinations, vomiting and severe shakes.Once the ""detoxification programme"" is over, patients undergo intensive individual and group therapy sessions. Surprisingly, most patients blame their problems on others. A bank manager undergoing treatment blamed his son who dropped out of college as the reason for his heavy drinking.The group therapy sessions help patients to confront their problems head on. In these sessions, recovering alcoholics narrate their problems, providing hope and making it easy for new patients to identify with them. Says psychologist Christina Chakravarthy: ""Group therapy helps in assuaging their guilt and releases their bottled-up feelings."" The patient is able to admit both to himself and others that he is an alcoholic.But to ensure that he does not yield to fresh temptation, the patient is put on a drug called Antabuse which causes a violent reaction if he consumes alcohol while on the course. The reactions could even result in death unless an antidote is administered within 24 hours.However, getting an alcoholic to admit that he is one and keeping him off liquor for a month is, as psychiatrist J.V. Devar puts it, ""only half the battle won"". The more difficult part is rehabilitating him so that he can start living a normal life. Most alcoholics have snapped ties with their family and friends and have probably lost their jobs too. One of the major hurdles psychiatrists face is in getting the family to be more understanding towards recovering alcoholics. This is easier said than done as the wife of a salesman-turned-alcoholic narrates. Her husband found that he hardly had any role to play at home because she did all the work and the children held back from him. To overcome these problems, the centre holds regular family counselling sessions where the families are taught how to cope with recovering alcoholics.While centres like TTRC may be difficult to replicate in the country, elsewhere, hospitals which have set up de-addiction clinics (and there are very few) have also been reporting encouraging results. One of them is the de-addiction centre run by the KEM Hospital in Bombay. Using a judicious combination of group therapy, individual counselling and an Antabuse course, the clinic reports that in the past two years it has been able to achieve a cure rate of 46 per cent. And in Bangalore, NIMHANS psychologists using aversion have reported an encouraging 45 per cent cure rate. Says psychologist V. Kumaraiah: ""We found that married people responded to treatment better than the rest, and the recovery rate was the highest among the older groups.But probably one of the most successful ways of treating addicts is the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) programme which is fast gaining popularity in the country. AA is a non-profit world-wide organisation of recovered alcoholics trying to help others in the same plight. There are already 100 such groups in the country, with Bombay alone boasting 55. Other cities with AA groups are Bangalore, Goa, Madras, Secunderabad, New Delhi, Cochin, Mangalore, Nagpur, Pune and Mysore. AA members find that the group sessions help alcoholics to come to terms with their problems. In fact the first step for all AA members is to admit that ""we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become unmanageable"". The sessions also help other recovering alcoholics by constantly reminding them of their earlier plight. Said an a a member: ""By trying to help others we are actually motivating ourselves to keep away from liquor."" For the families of alcoholics, the AA has a separate group called Al-Anon where members hold similar group therapy sessions. Rather than impose a set period of abstinence, the AAs golden rule for its members is: Get up every morning and tell yourself that you will remain sober for the next 24 hours. It seems to work.",{},"['ways', 'addicts', 'aa', 'anonymous', 'alcoholics', 'patients', 'treatment', 'problems', 'help', 'group', 'treating', 'programme', 'successful', 'centre', 'sessions', 'therapy']","It first admits patients to a nursing home for withdrawal symptoms like hallucinations, vomiting and severe shakes.Once the ""detoxification programme"" is over, patients undergo intensive individual and group therapy sessions.

"Compounded by denial and loneliness, alcoholism among women becomes growing urban problem","Compounded by denial and a dearth of treatment centres, alcoholism anions women is a growing urban problem.",,2013-06-20T14:12:29+05:30,India Today,"More than anything else, this letter from her 11-year-old daughter put Priya Singh, a Delhi housewife, back on the road to sobriety. ""That was my rock-bottom. I decided that I had to do something about my alcoholism."" But after drinking heavily for almost two years - something that pushed her marriage to the brink - she knew getting back to normal wasnt going to be easy. She visited a rehabilitation centre, and after several relapses finally succeeded in giving up alcohol altogether. Frequent attendance at the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings helped and Priya is beginning to pick up the broken pieces of her life. She is now reunited with her two children and is trying to make her marriage work. In urban India, alcoholism has for long been regarded as a male affliction. Not any more, as psychiatrists in the countrys metropolises report. What began as a trickle of female patients coming in for treatment is now a widening stream. An estimated three out of 10 alcoholics in many established clinics across the country are now women. Unfortunately, only now is the problem being taken seriously. At the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, the countrys premier neurosciences research institute, around 10 female patients used to report for treatment every month just five years ago. Now, there are 30 to 35 every month and the institute has been forced to open a separate outpatient department for women alcoholics. Explains Dr LA. Shariff, head of the Department of Psychiatric Social Welfare at NIMHANS: ""Nobody speaks or makes public this problem because, in the Indian situation, for a woman to be alcoholic is considered worse than being a prostitute or a criminal. There is social ostracism. So, the way most women cope with it is by hiding their problem."" In Bombay, as the problem escalated, the Kripa Foundation, which has seven centres across the country for treating alcoholics and drug addicts, had to open a separate section for women. Part of the reason, according to Ossie Pereira, co-founder of the foundation, was that ""most alcoholics, men and women, havent been able to handle sex normally. So if I had a mixed centre, I would have to start a maternity ward instead."" And Dr D. Mohan, head of the Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), predicts that by the year 2000, overall India is likely to see one female alcoholic for every three male alcoholics - a ratio prevalent in the West today. So, why exactly are women in India hitting the bottle in such alarming numbers? There is no clear answer. Research worldwide points a finger at a gene which could make alcoholism hereditary. Others talk of a certain percentage of people who are exposed to alcohol automatically becoming chemically dependent on it. For instance, the who estimates that one out of 25 people who drink will turn alcoholic as a result. Part of the reason for the dramatic rise in womens dependency on alcohol is simple - they are now more exposed to alcohol socially than at any time in the recent past. It is no longer taboo for women to drink in public, and in parties it is the done thing. Confirms Rakesh Ghildiyal, Associate Professor of psychiatry at KEM, Bombay: ""Alcohol is a bigger problem among women than any other drug because it now has social sanction."" Nowadays, three out of 10 alcoholics reporting for treatment in established clinics in Indian cities are women. Others, like Delhi-based psychiatrist Dr Avdesh Sharma, feel that it could be modern-day problems which are driving women to alcoholism. The most cited reason is stress. The balancing act required to keep a home and a career going has been known to take its toll. Conversely, a workaholic husband could lead to a depressed and lonely wife at home. Rachna Sharma, 38, would agree. Three grown-up children meant more time in her hands and a loving but hopelessly busy husband had no time to fill that. The bottle provided the initial solace and then the addiction took over. If loneliness is creeping stealthily into Indian lives as joint families - and even nuclear ones - break up, it is compounded by an increasing identity crisis faced by urbanised Indians. Are we as cool and hip as our western counterparts? Hot-shot marketing executive Sonia Malik, 40, wanted to be all that and more. ""I started drinking to deal with stress and to be in with the crowd."" The only problem was that her drinking continued well after everyone went home. And often, just as others were beginning their day - a pattern common among alcoholics. Denial and lack of empirical data have led to the problem turning even more serious. Says Ashwini Ailawadi, an addiction counsellor in Delhi: ""We have this neat policy of denial. Indian women do not have sex, they dont have orgasms and they dont drink. We simply solve the problem by denial."" The issues a woman alcoholic faces are very different from what a man goes through - this needs to be addressed. Her drinking is even more hidden than his, thus making it all the more difficult to detect. Says Sonia: ""I used to stay late in the office and drink secretly, but I was always very controlled in public - a woman has to be. I would fall apart the minute I reached home."" Home, unfortunately, is not where the support system is anymore. Husbands could be alcoholics or, at the very least, the initiating party. At the other end of the scale could be an alcoholic parent hovering in the background. Rahul Khanna, 40, became the target of his wifes criticism about five years ago. Her complaint? That he drank too much. In what she thought was an attempt at getting closer to him, Deepti, 35, too started drinking. ""We began to share a few drinks together and things began to look more cheerful."" she recalls. The cheer proved as short-lived as the fizz in a glass of beer. A truncated career and several violent fights later, the Khannas realised the severity of the problem. Career and family life are not the only things at risk. Studies conducted in the US show that spontaneous abortions and early miscarriages are more likely to occur among alcoholic women. Pregnant women in their first trimester are at a risk factor of 12 per cent even if they are modest drinkers. And the risk of congenital abnormalities is estimated to be as high as 32 per cent for women who are heavy drinkers. Worse, children are found to be more seriously affected by alcoholic mothers than fathers. The problem also persists because there are no stereotypes, no target groups. And unfortunately, no safe groups either. At one end of the spectrum are groups like tribals and plantation workers, from whom come 48 per cent of women alcohol users. Women in the weaker economic strata have always consumed alcohol. Now, there is the new addition of the middle classes, which could include anyone from a college student to a bored housewife. Says Karl Sequeria, joint director of the Bangalore-based Freedom Foundation, a rehabilitation centre: ""I find that more and more young college-going women are drinking heavily, a cause for grave concern."" Why Treatment is Tough Alcohol is often abused, with prescription pills making it a deadly cocktail. Complete lack of rehabilitation centres and support groups. Families are rarely supportive. So, while recognition is often myopic, treatment runs into a blind alley. Women face specific guilt trips and problems but rehabilitation centres and support groups are dominated by, and are often for, men. Rape, manipulation and sexual baiting are all part of a woman alcoholics routine. With such a negative gender background, a woman with this problem finds it difficult to enter a predominantly male group. Even an immensely successful support group like AA faces this problem. There is now a crying need for separate rehabilitation centres for women, like the one NIMHANS has begun. The silver lining to this dark cloud is that sobriety gives recovering women alcoholics an unparalleled high. Every experience is savoured with a new enthusiasm and talk of a new life. Sonia, who was considered dead for all practical and financial reasons, is today at the centre of all family decisions. Priya is the emotional anchor for her two teenage children. Most of them further the cause of sobriety by keeping their doors open to fellow alcoholics. - with Arun Kattyar in Bombay and Saritha Rai in Bangalore ______________________________________________________________________________ (Names of some people have been changed to protect their identities.)",{},"['women', 'loneliness', 'problem', 'drinking', 'alcoholics', 'rehabilitation', 'treatment', 'alcohol', 'alcoholism', 'growing', 'woman', 'compounded', 'urban', 'denial', 'alcoholic', 'support']","Now, there are 30 to 35 every month and the institute has been forced to open a separate outpatient department for women alcoholics.

Alternative Names Detoxification - alcohol; Detox - alcohol Causes Alcohol withdrawal occurs most often in adults, but it may occur in teenagers or children. The more you drink every day, the more likely you are to develop alcohol withdrawal symptoms when you stop drinking. You may have more severe withdrawal symptoms if you have certain other medical problems. Symptoms Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually occur within 8 hours after the last drink, but can occur days later. Symptoms usually peak by 24 - 72 hours, but may persist for weeks. Common symptoms include: Anxiety or nervousness or nervousness Depression Fatigue Irritability Jumpiness or shakiness Mood swings Nightmares Not thinking clearly Other symptoms may include: Clammy skin Enlarged (dilated) pupils Headache Insomnia (sleeping difficulty) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Pallor Rapid heart rate Sweating Tremor of the hands or other body parts A severe form of alcohol withdrawal called delirium tremens can cause: Agitation Fever Seeing or feeling things that arent there (hallucinations) Seizures Severe confusion Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal: Abnormal eye movements Abnormal heart rhythms Dehydration (not enough fluids in the body) Fever Rapid breathing Rapid heart rate Shaky hands Blood and urine tests, including a toxicology screen , may be done. Treatment The goal of treatment includes: Reducing withdrawal symptoms Preventing complications of alcohol use Therapy to get you to stop drinking (abstinence) INPATIENT TREATMENT People with moderate-to-severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may need inpatient treatment at a hospital or other facility that treats alcohol withdrawal. You will be watched closely for hallucinations and other signs of delirium tremens . Treatment may include: Monitoring of blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, and blood levels of different chemicals in the body Fluids or medications through a vein (by IV) Sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete OUTPATIENT TREATMENT If you have mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms, you can often be treated in an outpatient setting. You will need someone to commit to staying with you during this process and who can keep an eye on you. Daily visits to your health care provider are often needed until you are stable. Treatment usually includes: Sedative drugs to help ease withdrawal symptoms Blood tests Patient and family counseling to discuss the long-term issue of alcoholism Testing and treatment for other medical problems linked to alcohol use It is important that the patient goes to a living situation that helps support them in staying sober. Some areas have housing options that provide a supportive environment for those trying to stay sober. Permanent and life-long abstinence from alcohol is the best treatment for those who have gone through withdrawal. Support Groups The following organizations are good resources for information on alcoholism: Alcoholics Anonymous - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org Al-Anon/Alateen - www.al-anon.org - www.al-anon.org National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism - http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health - http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - www.samhsa.gov Outlook (Prognosis) How well a person does depends on the amount of organ damage and whether the person can stop drinking completely. Alcohol withdrawal may range from a mild and uncomfortable disorder to a serious, life-threatening condition. Symptoms such as sleep changes, rapid changes in mood, and fatigue may last for months. People who continue to drink a lot may develop health problems such as liver, heart, and neurological disease. Most people who go through alcohol withdrawal make a full recovery. However, death is possible, especially if delirium tremens occurs. When to Contact a Medical Professional Alcohol withdrawal is a serious condition that may rapidly become life threatening. Call your health care provider or go the emergency room if you think you might be in alcohol withdrawal, especially if you were using alcohol often and recently stopped. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if symptoms persist after treatment. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if seizures, fever, severe confusion, hallucinations, or irregular heartbeats occur. Prevention Reduce or avoid alcohol. If you have alcoholism, you should stop drinking completely. References OConnor PG. Alcohol abuse and dependence. In: Goldman L, Schafer AI, eds. Cecil Medicine. 24th ed.

""It was awful, terrible,"" he told The Guardian while talking about his struggle. ""It owned me."" ""When I watch that film back, I can see where I was then, which was fairly lost, and unhappy, and an alcoholic,"" Pegg added. The actor said he ""micro managed"" his condition for quite some time, till the ball dropped. ""One thing (addiction) does is make you clever at not giving anything away. People think junkies and alcoholics are slovenly, unmotivated people. Theyre not they are incredibly organised. They can nip out for a quick shot of whisky and you wouldnt know they have gone. Its as if you are micro-managed by it,"" Pegg said. ""But eventually the signs are too obvious. You have taken the dog for one too many walks,"" he added.

'The communal vein in the terrorist violence is disturbing',The communal vein in the terrorist violence is disturbing. The divide between the two major communities in the state seems to be total. The police is totally demoralised and communal. Ribeiro's appointment should boost the sagging morale of the police.,,2014-01-31T13:12:09+05:30,India Today,"The cover story on alcoholism (""Growing Malaise"", April 30) is both interesting and alarming. The only disincentive to excessive drinking and smoking would be an enormous price hike on these commodities. But the Governments collections from taxes on alcohol are substantial and a downward trend in sales would not be favoured. The growing malaise of alcoholism can only be controlled by the Government.The reference in your cover story on alcoholism to Mathew, a copywriter in a leading advertising agency in New Delhi, has caused me serious embarrassment as I have been receiving calls from my friends and business associates. I have recently started out on my own after leaving Lintas, my last employers, with goodwill.In the absence of the full name of the person you are referring to, your report is going to serve as a disincentive to my present and future clients and thereby affect my new business venture. I am sure you will agree that alcoholics do not embark on business ventures and employ staff and premises, as I have done. As far as I am concerned, I have never visited Alcoholics Anonymous anywhere any time.As a grateful and recovering member of the wonderful fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, I wish to express my appreciation for your lead story on alcoholism. AA has perhaps one of the most successful programmes for treating addicts. I would also like to add that we at AA have no desire to dry up the world. Our purpose is to stay sober and help alcoholics achieve sobriety.The only hope for Punjab (""Upsurge of Violence"", April 15) lies in weaning the mass of Sikhs away from the militants. Those who believe that the militants can be suppressed by physical force are living in a world of illusion. Heinous as their crimes are the reactions of the press, government and political parties only help the militants cause. The people wonder why these same groups did not condemn as vociferously the murder of innocent Sikhs in June and October 1984. Why were those guilty of murder then let off, while those picked up as extremists are still kept in custody. Tackling militancy in Punjab is a delicate task requiring an understanding of the Sikh psyche.and othersThe unending crisis in the state is a pointer to the inefficiency and apathy of the Punjab Government, both the present and the erstwhile ones, in dealing with the fissiparous forces who are out to sunder the country. Determination has been the hallmark of the terrorists, and by their well-planned attacks on innocent people, they have time and again proved that they have the support of alien forces.The communal vein in the terrorist violence is disturbing. The divide between the two major communities in the state seems to be total. The police is totally demoralised and communal. Ribeiros appointment should boost the sagging morale of the police.Punjab has become another pawn on the political chess-board. Moves are made without consulting the people and the Governments decision is forcing people to make moves that they dont want to. The state needs to tread carefully.The Governments policy of interfering and not allowing the police or those responsible for maintaining law and order to concentrate on one task has meant the weakening of defences. The state is bowing down to the terrorists sinister designs by not ensuring communal harmony. Its an Upsurge of Super-Violence.Sometimes the Punjab problem seems quite hopeless. I cant understand why people feel Hindus and Sikhs are not brothers. Sikhism is as much a part of the Hindu religion as Shaivism and Vaishnavism.Peace can only be brought back to Punjab by force. If we want peace we must prepare ourselves for war against the terrorists acting at the behest of foreign powers. Every party should unite and work jointly, fired by a spirit of national solidarity. National integration is the weapon for our survival.If the people unite to resist the growing communalism, the terrorists will be demoralised and return to the mainstream. The Akali Government should not be so weak-kneed.In your Special Report (""Operation Disarm"" April 15), you did not emphasise the fact that the verification procedure for the issue of gun licences is hardly likely to improve the efficiency of the understaffed Uttar Pradesh police. If the Government had the foresight to consider an armed people as a deterrent to crime, such senseless projects would never see the light of day.At a time when law and order is practically non-existent and the police ineffective, people must be allowed to make arrangements for their own protection. Gun licences must be abolished. History is with us in this regard. It was the British who first introduced the arms licence in India, to disarm the Indian people, after suppressing the 1857 mutiny.Your article faithfully echoes the sarkari tune regarding reducing the number of licensed weapons with citizens. Licensed weapons are rarely used in committing crimes - a fact which even the Lucknow SSP could have corroborated if he knew his facts. What needs to be curbed is the menace of illegal firearms which outnumber the former 10:1.""The Dues of Death"" (April 15) on the Dom Raja is poignant and moving. Choudhurys pathetic statement, ""If I open a shop who will come""? is a telling comment on our society. It is a pity that the scourge of untouchability is yet to free our hearts and minds.It is regrettable that a magazine of your stature has seen it to publish such bizarre and nightmarish photographs. They are nauseous, to say the least. I have hidden the issue from my children lest they get scared.Your article (""Poaching Problems"" April 15) has left out the fact that the IAS rules the roost in all departments. Rules are tailor-made to suit them. For instance. a deputation to the public sector means permanent absorption to all except IAS officers, who are free to jump from post to post. They refuse to work in the districts, except as very junior officers and the IAS is the only service where everybody rises to the level of additional secretary irrespective of competence.Tamil Nadus chief minister (""The Fading Star"" April 15) has become a black hole! MGR is a spent force. He should gracefully retire when he is still widely admired and respected. After all, how long can Tamil Nadu tolerate this Rip Van Winkle?Your story (""Vulnerable Targets"" April 15) raises one question. When the banks do not take adequate security measures, why do the insurance companies compensate them? Is it because the compensation is paid out of public money and not out of their pockets? Also, insurance companies must insist on some security norms that all banks have to follow.Your article quotes Police Commissioner Soman as saying that ""nobody knows the procedure to be followed when there is a robbery"". But he conveniently forgot the police who issue gun licences indiscriminately, endangering innocent citizens.Your report on Sobh raj (""The Escape Scandal"" April 15) raises a very disturbing thought. If Ved Prakash Garg had not been sacked for leaking his letter to the press, and his suggestions accepted and implemented, Tihar jail would not be in the soup it is today. It also brings to mind President Zail Singhs statement about the prison: ""It is shocking, shameful and unbelievable.""(Retd)The Doordarshan article (""The Money Machine"" April 15) made shocking revelations about high-level corruption. Will Corruption in TV figure as the next episode inOn the day I was reading your article, Doordarshan screened the telefilm Hum Nahin Sudhrmge, which centred on corruption. Perhaps by showing this film, which was suddenly brought in place of another film, Doordarshan wanted the viewers to know that things just wont improve.Your exposure of Air-Indias manner of leasing freighter aircraft (""Double Dealing"", March 31) has put the airlines officials on the mat. Instead of setting their house in order, the Maharajahs men have inserted a quarter page advertisement in leading newspapers in defence. There is nothing new in their denials, which could have been made through a press release as is the practice.Your article (""Bad Taste"" March 31) ridicules our efforts in exporting fresh fruits and vegetables.

"Alcoholism in India acquires alarming overtones, makes dangerous inroads in society","Unobtrusively, alcoholism in India has suddenly acquired alarming overtones. Recent surveys have produced statistical findings that illustrate the dangerous inroads alcoholism has already made in Indian society and with what devastating effect.",,2014-01-27T15:52:09+05:30,India Today,"Pour yourself your favourite drink. Sit down, loosen your shoe laces and relax. Take a large swig. Feel the warmth flow into your system. Let the surge of confidence envelope you. Then answer these questions: Do you prefer to drink alone? Do you drink daily? Does drinking spoil your sleep? Do you drink to bolster your confidence? Is drinking affecting your work? Is your family affected by it? Have you ever had a black-out? If you have answered yes to any three of these questions then its bad news. You are either an alcoholic or well on your way to becoming one. Worried? Then push your glass firmly away and listen. You are not the only one. A tidal wave of alcoholism is engulfing the country. While in the sixties one in 300 drinkers were alcoholics now become addicts. At exactly 7 p.m. every Saturday in the annexe building of a church on the busy Parliament Street in New Delhi, 20-odd people sit around a hexagonal table lit by candles. Among them are salesmen, businessmen, armed forces officers, government officials, factory workers and even a doctor. As the meeting progresses each one narrates how alcohol has destroyed his life. Choking with emotion, Mathew, a copy-writer in an advertising agency, says: ""After a drunken bout I was like an animal. I messed my pants, vomited on the floor and crawled on the floor, unable to pick myself up."" A tremendous feeling of empathy builds as the session ends, because each understands the others sorrows, and many of those present weep openly. The meeting is typical of those held regularly across the country by 100 such Alcoholics Anonymous groups, a rapidly growing organisation of ex-drinkers trying to reform addicts. A different kind of scene is being enacted in a white-tiled room at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore. Krishnappa, a 38-year-old coffee planter, has his left arm strapped to a 40-volt transformer and is given a glass of whisky. As soon as he takes a sip he is given a mild shock that makes him grimace in pain. This aversion therapy is designed to make Krishnappas psyche reject alcohol. Krishnappa started drinking when he was 16 and today he does little other than drink. His disgusted wife brought him for treatment last month. Police test driver for drinking: Police test driver for drinking: In more homely surroundings inside a sprawling house in Madras, Swaminathan, a 55-year-old former bank manager, struggles with a picture puzzle given to him by psychologists at the T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Centre (TTRC) in Madras. The puzzle is designed to test how badly Swaminathans brain has been damaged by alcohol. Swaminathan never drank when he was young, and was introduced to liquor after he was promoted as regional manager in the bank and forced to attend wet parties. Soon he was hooked. At home he became irritable and constantly abused his wife, throwing the food she served and breaking crockery. His drinking affected his son so badly that he dropped out of college.Mathew, Krishnappa and Swaminathan are only the froth on a tidal wave of alcoholism engulfing the country. And there is a cask-full of statistics to prove the point. In the 60s only one in 300 drinkers was considered an alcoholic. Then the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that by 1980 an estimated three million - or one in 25 - of the 80 million Indians who consume alcohol had become severely addicted.Last year the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) surveyed the problem in four regions - Bangalore, Delhi. Dibrugarh and Ranchi. lt found that 20 per cent of urban consumers had become totally dependent on it, while in villages the figure went as high as 30 to 40 per cent. Davinder Mohan, who coordinated the ICMR survey and heads the Department of Psychiatry at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, says: ""Alcohol is already taking a heavy toll in the country. Its soon going to be evident even to a blind person.""The toll, in fact, has already become starkly evident: In major hospitals alcoholics now form 20 to 30 per cent of the patients in psychiatric wards when five years ago they constituted only 0.2 per cent. In Bombays KEM Hospital, which treated 309 patients in the past two years, sociologist Hema Shah says: ""Initially we got people only from the slum areas. But soon bank officers, managers, factory workers and even government officers started coming for treatment. The middle class too seems to be affected in a big way."" On the production line: 350 brands to choose from On the production line: 350 brands to choose from Last years ICMR study indicated that half the industrial workers surveyed drink regularly, and companies report that alcoholism has become one of the major causes of absenteeism and falling productivity. At Ashok Leyland in Madras, for instance, managers estimate that atleast 500 of the companys 7,500 workers are problem drinkers. Says Executive Director J. Joseph: ""We used to have 10 per cent absenteeism, but now we find it going up to 22 per cent and we think alcoholism has a great deal to do with it.""Alcohol is a major cause of broken marriages. Relationships with wives were seriously disrupted in 64 per cent of the alcoholics. In Bombay, Bagashri Parikh, a marriage counsellor at the city court, says that one out of 10 divorces is because of alcoholic husbands and adds: Most of the alcoholics beat their wives regularly.""The countrys road research institutes estimate that 25 per cent of road accidents are alcohol-related and that a third of the drivers on the highway are under the influence of alcohol. In Delhi, when the AIIMS did a study of accident victims suffering from head injuries, it found that 20 per cent had consumed alcohol.Surveying the damage Hira Singh, director. National Institute of Social Defence (NISD), the Union Welfare Ministrys striking arm against drug abuse, says:  There is no doubt that alcohol is the most widely abused drug in the country."" Thats certainly true. Alcoholism has traditionally been associated with the tribal areas in the country, where people brew their own liquor. Then the problem spread to the hilly areas and the northeast, and to industrial townships and the coalfields. Now other areas too have got ensnared, hitting people from all walks of life: professionals, businessmen, industrial workers, government servants, armed forces officers and farmers. The statistics reveal that most of the patients (98 per cent) are predominantly male, and usually in the prime of their lives at 25 years and above. A majority are married and have children. In most cases they are the only bread-winners in the family. ""Its hitting the most productive section of our society and is creating havoc,"" says psychiatrist J.V. Devar in Madras. Researchers are hard put to explain the dramatic rise in alcoholism in a country that has prohibition enshrined as a Directive Principle of the Constitution. But prohibition as a policy has been steadily given up by one state after another, and liquor is now as easily available as tea leaves in most parts of the country. Alcohol consumption, inevitably, has gone up quite dramatically. In 1976, liquor manufacturers used up 169.4 million litres of pure alcohol, enough to manufacture 350 million bottles of rum. Alcoholics Anonymous meeting Alcoholics Anonymous meeting But despite tough measures by the puritanical Janata government and the Congress(I)s resolve to hold production at the 1981 level of 207.9 million litres, the consumption of pure alcohol climbed to 331 million litres last year - sufficient to produce 1,134 million bottles of rum!Indians now have more than 200 brands of whisky, 50 brands of rum, 30 kinds of brandy, 10 brands of gin, 15 of wine, 50 beers and a couple of hundred varieties of country liquor to choose from. ""People have become more brand conscious and are willing to pay more for better quality liquor these days,"" says Ravi Jain, general manager of McDowells, a subsidiary of United Breweries, which is among the big five in the liquor business. McDowells has registered a 10 per cent growth every year.That Indians are drinking more than ever before is evident by their revolutionary change in attitudes towards drinking. The traditional taboo against liquor is rapidly vanishing. More and more homes serve liquor to guests, dry parties are considered boring, and traditional festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Holi are used as excuses to go on drinking bouts. Salesmen and businessmen prefer to do business over lunch lined with liquor. Among youngsters, to drink is to be manly. ""We are becoming more of an alcoholised society,"" says psychiatrist Rajat Ray of NIMHANS. And in Lucknow, psychiatrist B.B. Sethi says: ""A house not serving liquor is now an exception."" Drinking in bars, once the haunt of only the hardened alcoholic, has gained increasing acceptance. In the outskirts of Patna. for instance, roadside bhattis, the poor mans bars, have become popular drinking places. One of them on the bypass road to Patna is a huge, sprawling dimly-lit shack reeking with the stench of liquor, rotten fish and frying eggs. Around 250 people, among them teenagers, sit around in groups chatting and shouting. They come from all social groups - rickshaw-pullers, factory workers, professionals and even police constables in civilian dress. Babu Lalrai, 35, a tailor, chirps up: Yes, I drink daily and go to the Ganga for a holy dip daily."" The wave of alcoholism is by no means confined to the cities. While the sale of country liquor in most states has risen slowly, this masks the fact that people have increasingly moved to cheaper, illicit liquor because even country liquor costs as much as Rs 8 for a bottle. In Bangalore, arrack king H.R. Basavaraj estimates that ""illicit liquor sales equal that of country liquor"". The repetitive liquor tragedies testify to this. In Bangalore more than 300 people died of liquor poisoning in 1981. The next year in the island of Vypeen in Kerala, 72 people were killed. On an average more than 200 people are killed in the country from liquor poisoning every year. Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age Youngsters drinking: vulnerable age What worries many psychiatrists is the widespread acceptance of beer and the current boom in beer sales. In Maharashtra, beer sales have jumped from 14 million bottles to 24 million bottles in the last five years. And in West Bengal, more beer is consumed than whisky, rum and brandy put together; last years beer sales totalled 12 million bottles. But if people regard beer as some kind of milk product, the harsh truth is that one bottle of beer has about the same alcohol content as a peg of whisky, and psychiatrists say that beer drinking not only opens the floodgates for more potent liquor but is addictive and in the long run can do as much damage as whisky or rum. The splurge in drinking is reflected in the high per capita consumption of liquor. While the annual per capita consumption of alcohol by adults in India hovers around one litre of pure alcohol (equivalent to two-and-a-half bottles of rum), a little lower than Australias 1.5 and a lot less than the USs 4.1, this figure is misleading. Unlike Australia and the US, women in India hardly drink. So if only the male populations consumption is calculated, the figure jumps to around two litres of pure alcohol. And if only the drinking male population is taken into account, the figure is as high as 4.1, or 10 bottles of rum per head annually: high enough for the alarm bells to be ringing. Even this excludes the millions of litres of illicit liquor that goes down parched gullets. And in states like Punjab, the per capita consumption is 6.5 litres of pure alcohol, or 16 bottles of rum. All drinkers are not drunkards. So when does a normal drinker turn alcoholic? The popular concept of the drunk is one who falls into gutters or staggers around on streets mouthing obscenities. But that, say psychiatrists, is only the last stages of alcoholism. A social drinker becomes a problem one when, according to Shanthi Ranganathan of TTRC: ""His drinking starts affecting on a continuous basis his health, his job efficiency and his relations with his family and friends."" The who estimates that one out of 10 drinkers turns alcoholic. Most drinkers do not realise when they have crossed the thin red line between social drinking and alcoholism. In Madras, Udayakumar, 37, a former packing manufacturer, thought he had his drinking well under control till one day he realised that ""a quarter of a bottle of rum was a mosquito bite"". In Bangalore, a salesman remembers that while initially he could hardly hold a peg of whisky he suddenly found himself going on long drinking bouts. Says he: ""Every cell in my body craved for alcohol and when I took a drink it was like setting off a nuclear reaction. I didnt stop drinking till I became unconscious."" And in Bombay, a factory supervisor initially started drinking during week-ends with friends. Then, as he says, ""after a while I drank once in three days, then every alternate day, then every day and then every hour"". Researchers now agree that alcoholism is a disease, because alcoholics exhibit predictable symptoms and suffer the same physical and mental trauma: severe shakes, damage to vital organs like the heart and liver, and psychological breakdown. Society, which always dismissed alcoholics as weak-willed or immoral people, is only now reluctantly beginning to accept this home truth. In Bangalore, Malavika, a 30-year-old management consultant married to a lawyer, confesses: ""I thought all drunkards were bums till my husband became an alcoholic. Initially I was bewildered and thought he drank because he was not happy with me. But I soon realised that although he desperately wanted to give up alcohol he couldnt. It was as though he had caught a disease."" Once the disease catches on it moves with terrifying rapidity, reducing its victims to physical, mental and moral wrecks. Try as they will, they find it impossible to kick the habit even though they know that it is steadily destroying their lives. A Bombay naval officer remembers with tears how he tied his favourite Labrador and whipped it mercilessly in a drunken fit. The next morning the dog seemed to forget the beating and wagged its tail, but he was so insane that he whipped it again. Mathew, the Delhi copy-writer, remembers how he threw up a Rs 5,000 job in a leading advertising agency when he quarrelled with his employer over a trivial matter. Probably the most damaging effect of this wave of alcoholism, according to a doctor, is that ""not only the drinker but everyone in the family suffers. Alcoholism is a family disease."" As the alcoholic becomes more and more obnoxious, the wife and children get seriously affected. Malavika, the lawyers wife, recalls the traumatic experience when guests dropped in one morning and found her husband lying on the floor dead drunk. The naval commanders wife once tried to jump out of a fourth floor window after he slapped her in a drunken rage. Children too are badly affected. In a typical case in Bangalore, Arun, 17, whose father has been a chronic alcoholic, dropped out of school and took to drugs and alcohol. In fact studies abroad indicate that alcoholism could also be a familial disease, with children of alcoholics being more prone to becoming alcoholics themselves. If more families have not broken up, it is because most Indian wives fear the stigma attached to divorce. Last fortnight Malathi, 38, the wife of a former supervisor in a printing press and mother of five children, came to social workers at the Maharashtra State Womens Council for help. Her husband had beaten her so badly that her cheek and shoulder were blue-black. She said her husband had lost his job because of his drinking, and when she wanted to take up a job her husband refused to allow her and suspected her fidelity. Her eldest son had become a vagrant and a petty thief. But when the council suggested she divorce her husband. she flatly refused. Says the councils social worker Anila Merchant: ""For most sufferers marriage provides some form of security."" A just-published study of workers at the Madras Port Trust, done by sociologist Saraswathi Sankaran, shows how damaging alcohol can be. Of the 162 workers surveyed, more than half of them drank heavily, and a third were addicts. Sankaran compared the work performance of the drinkers and non-drinkers and was stunned to find that the heavy drinkers were absent every sixth working day. As a result, the non-drinkers took home 50 per cent more money than the drinkers, spent8 per cent more on food, 30 per cent more on clothing, 168 per cent more on health care and a whopping 300 per cent more on childrens education. Says Sankaran: ""Whether it is poverty, malnutrition, marital disharmony or delinquent children, alcohol seems to have been the major cause of all their miseries.  While alcoholism and its related problems increase alarmingly, progress on the treatment of sufferers has been tardy. Most alcoholics find that doctors treat the problem as a moral issue. Said one alcoholic: ""My whole world had crumbled, and here was this doctor telling me I must develop the will power to stop drinking."" Only now are hospitals recognising alcoholism as a major problem and setting up specialised clinics for treatment (see box). As a consequence, there are facilities for treating hardly 3,000 of the estimated three million alcoholics in the country. But even hospitals that have clinics are faced with problems like the lack of professionally trained staff. The problem is compounded by the fact that most alcoholics do not get themselves treated till at a very late stage, because most people do not like to admit they have an alcoholic in their family and try to conceal the fact as long as possible. A factory supervisor in Bombay, who had been an alcoholic for five years, first tried to give up drinking himself. When that failed his wife sent him to the local mantravadi to exorcise the spirit that seemed to have possessed him. It was only when he was admitted to the KEM Hospital with an attack of jaundice that he learnt the hospital had a de-addiction programme. Infact, most of the patients usually go to hospital when they have serious health problems such as cirrhosis of the liver or fits of delirium. If the psychiatrists find it difficult to cope with the problem, the Government seems equally helpless. The state governments, which control alcohol supply and distribution, indirectly encourage people to drink more because revenue from excise forms a major part of the income of most states. In Karnataka liquor is the second biggest money-spinner for the state, netting Rs 50 crore last year, while in Tamil Nadu it accounts for a good 8 per cent of the revenue. Total liquor sales in the country would amount to something like Rs 3,000 crore, and liquor companies form a powerful lobby group. Ironically, although the Constitution has made prohibition a Directive Principle, the states have made only feeble attempts to make prohibition effective policy. Most governments in fact have given up prohibition altogether. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which had imposed prohibition at different times, ran into trouble and were forced to relax their rules. Tamil Nadu needed the excise revenue to run its midday meal scheme. Maharashtra, which strangely enough has placed prohibition and excise under the same department, is quite happy counting the take from liquor sales while running a prohibition programme to educate people on the evils of drinking. Bihar was forced to lift prohibition after a large number of people died in of illicit liquor in the Dhanbad coalfields. Right now Gujarat is the only state where prohibition is enforced, but liquor is still easily available and the policy is commonly seen as a farce. Wiser from these experiences. many states have set up temperance boards in the fond hope that if they cannot prevent people from drinking they can convince them to drink moderately. But most of these boards do little more than release advertisements in newspapers showing a bottle marked with the familiar skull and crossbones. With governments unable to curb the menace, people have taken matters into their own hands. In distant Imphal in Manipur, women were so disgusted with their men folks excessive drinking that they formed themselves into an association against drunkards and kept vigil at nights in front of liquor shops and bars. Any drunkard they catch is publicly humiliated by making him walk with a string of bottles tied around his neck, and then handed over to the police. In the hills of Uttar Pradesh and tribal areas of Bihar similar peoples movements have met with notable success in an area where drunkenness has become a major social problem. Mean while, to formulate fresh strategies against drinking and drug abuse, the Welfare Ministry two years ago set up a working group chaired by its joint secretary. This is likely to stress education programmes on the evils of drinking. As Rajendra Kumari Bajpai, minister of state for welfare says: ""A stroke of the pen, like imposing a total ban, is not going to help. If we have to bring alcoholism under control we need to use persuasion, create awareness and show a strong determination to implement our programmes."" But with both the Central and state governments failing to make a serious dent in the two vital factors that the who says leads to an increase in alcoholism - easy availability and increasing demand for alcohol - the battle of the bottle may be well and truly lost.",{},"['drinking', 'million', 'alcoholics', 'makes', 'cent', 'alarming', 'dangerous', 'alcohol', 'india', 'country', 'alcoholism', 'inroads', 'acquires', 'society', 'alcoholic', 'drink', 'liquor', 'overtones']","In 1976, liquor manufacturers used up 169.4 million litres of pure alcohol, enough to manufacture 350 million bottles of rum.

Alternative Names Neuropathy - alcoholic; Alcoholic polyneuropathy Causes The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. Itlikely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition. In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved. Risksof alcoholic neuropathy include: Long-term, heavy alcohol use Alcoholism that is present for 10 years or more Symptoms Numbness in the arms and legs in the arms and legs Abnormal sensations , such as""pins and needles"" , such as""pins and needles"" Painful sensations in the arms and legs Muscle weakness Muscle cramps or muscle aches or Heat intolerance , especially after exercise , especially after exercise Impotence (in men) (in men) Problems urinating , incontinence (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, difficulty beginning to urinate , (leaking urine), feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, Constipation Diarrhea Nausea, vomiting Additional symptoms that may occur with this disease: Swallowing difficulty Speech impairment Loss of muscle function or feeling Muscle contractions or spasm or spasm Muscle atrophy Movement disorders Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time. Exams and Tests Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems. Alcoholism often makes your body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests will beordered to check for a deficiency (lack of): Thiamine (vitamin B1) Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) Pantothenic acid and biotin Vitamin B12 Folic acid Niacin (vitamin B3) Vitamin A Additional tests may beordered to rule out other possible causes of neuropathy. Tests may include: Electrolyte levels Electromyography ( EMG ) Liver and kidney function tests Thyroid function tests Levels of vitamins and minerals in the body Nerve conduction tests Nerve biopsy Upper GI and small bowel series Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) ) Voiding cystourethrogram Treatment Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include: Controlling symptoms Maximizing ability to function independently Preventing injury It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid. Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed tomake suremuscle function and limb position are maintained. Medicines may be neededto treat pain or uncomfortable sensations.Because persons with alcoholic neuropathy have alcohol dependence problems, theyare advised to take the least amount of medicine needed to reduce symptoms to help prevent drug dependence and other side effects of chronic use. Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may reduce pain for some people. Light-headedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may require several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces symptoms. Treatments that may help include: Wearing compression stockings Eating extra salt Sleeping with the head elevated Using medicines Bladderproblems may be treated with: Manual expression of urine Intermittent catheterization ( male or female ) Medicines Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy. It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include: Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns Changing footwear Frequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes Guarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure Alcohol must be stopped to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcoholism may include counseling or social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or taking medicines. Outlook (Prognosis) Damage to nerves from alcoholic neuropathy is usually permanent.It is likely to get worse ifthe personcontinues to use alcohol orif nutritional problems are notcorrected. Alcoholic neuropathyis usually not life-threatening, but itcan severely affect quality of life. Possible Complications Disability Long-term (chronic) discomfort or pain Injury to extremities Falling, especially at night Urinary incontinence or retention When to Contact a Medical Professional Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy.

Alternative Names Gambling - compulsive; Compulsive gambling; Addictive gambling Causes Pathological gambling usually begins in early adolescence in men, and between ages 20 and 40 in women. Pathological gambling often involves repetitive behaviors. People with this problem have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble. Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder, pathological gambling is likely a different condition. In people who develop pathological gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems. Symptoms People with pathological gambling often feel ashamed and try to avoid letting other people know about their problem. The American Psychiatric Association defines pathological gambling as having five or more of the following symptoms: Committing crimes to get money to gamble Feeling restless or irritable when trying to cut back or quit gambling Gambling to escape problems or feelings of sadness or anxiety Gambling larger amounts of money to try to make back past losses Losing a job, relationship, education, or career opportunity due to gambling Lying about the amount of time or money spent gambling Making many unsuccessful attempts to cut back or quit gambling Needing to borrow money due to gambling losses Needing to gamble larger amounts of money in order to feel excitement Spending a lot of time thinking about gambling, such as remembering past experiences or ways to get more money with which to gamble Exams and Tests A psychiatric evaluation and history can be used to diagnose pathological gambling. Screening tools such as the Gamblers Anonymous 20 Questions can help with the diagnosis. Treatment Treatment for people with pathological gambling begins with recognizing the problem. Pathological gamblers often deny they have a problem or need treatment. Most people with pathological gambling only get treated when other people pressure them. Treatment options include: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Self-help support groups , such as Gamblers Anonymous. Gamblers Anonymous is a 12-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Practices used to treat other types of addiction, such as substance abuse and alcohol dependence , can also be helpful in treating pathological gambling. A few studies have been done on medications for treating pathological gambling. Early results suggest that antidepressants and opioid antagonists (naltrexone) may help treat the symptoms of pathological gambling. However, it is not yet clear which people will respond to medications. Outlook (Prognosis) Like alcohol or drug addiction, pathological gambling is a long-term disorder that tends to get worse without treatment. Even with treatment, its common to start gambling again (relapse). However, people with pathological gambling can do very well with the right treatment. Possible Complications Complications may include: Alcohol and drug abuse problems Anxiety Depression Financial, social, and legal problems (including bankruptcy, divorce, job loss, time in prison) Heart attacks (from the stress and excitement of gambling) Suicide attempts Getting the right treatment can help prevent many of these problems. When to Contact a Medical Professional Call your health care provider or mental health professional if you believe you have symptoms of pathological gambling. Prevention Exposure to gambling may increase the risk of developing pathological gambling. Limiting exposure may be helpful for people who are at risk. Public exposure to gambling, however, continues to increase in the form of lotteries, electronic and Internet gambling, and casinos. Intervention at the earliest signs of pathological gambling may prevent the disorder from getting worse. References Gould CM, Sanders KM. Impulse-control disorders.

The skywriter,,,2010-01-15T15:49:50+05:30,India Today,"More than a decade ago, when I first visited the Nehru Planetarium, I never knew what surprises awaited me. I was a student of literature with no interest in astrophysics whatsoever. I was accompanying a friend who was a member of AAAD. I had heard lots of interesting stories about this club (which sounded more like Alcoholics Anonymous), but actually stood for Amateur Astronomers Association of Delhi. My first impression of the planetarium was that it was a dark and dim place with lots of space-related objects that made little sense to me at the time. But the moment I entered the Night Sky Theatre, I was hooked. It has a simulated night sky where amateur astronomers learn to navigate their way across the stars, constellations and other heavenly bodies. I was amazed to know that not only do the constellations have names, but all 88 of them have names for each of the star that forms them as well. Another thing that truly interested me as a literature student was that most of the northern constellations were named after Greek gods like Aries, legendary heroes such as Hercules, mythical creatures like Cetus, Centaurus and Hydra, and even the mythological river of Eridanus! Who would have thought that I would see an amalgamation of literature and ancient mythology in the so-called den of science. It as then that I realised that astronomy is different things to different people. Maybe that is the reason why AAAD housed members from six to 60 years old. It nurtured peoples imaginations and inspired them to look at the heavens and beyond. For school students, who usually come during the vacations, it is a place to make that special science project that will give them an edge over others. For college students, it is a stepping stone to know more about astrophysics and astronomy-a field that is unfortunately not covered in the undergraduate level in any Indian university. Even when I accompanied our group for overnight observations in the hinterland, I noticed that everyone saw the stars from their individual perspective. A student of chemistry sees nuclear reactions. A physicist may be more interested in the electromagnetic effect that celestial objects will have. A farmer sees the night sky as a calendar that helps him decide when to sow and reap his harvest. A navigator sees the night sky as a guide pointing to new places. A poet sees the beauty of the night sky as an inspiration. To the common man, with an interest in myths, the night sky reflects the different stories heard during childhood. This was one of the many reasons why I chose to be faithful to astronomy-it is a truly democratic science. In short, astronomy has a very big heart, perhaps as big as the universe it tries to explore.

Alternative Names Beer consumption; Wine consumption; Hard liquor consumption; Safe drinking Information Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world. TEEN DRINKING Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month, despite the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the U.S. About 1 in 5 teens are considered ""problem drinkers."" This means that they: Get drunk Have accidents related to alcohol use Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them: Beeris about 5% alcohol, although some beers can have more. Wine is usually 12 to 15% alcohol. Hard liquor is about 45% alcohol. Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly. The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly. Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster. A carbonated (fizzy) alcoholic drink, such as champagne, will be absorbed faster than a non-carbonated drink. Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your ""blood alcohol level."" If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises. Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The blood alcohol legal limit usually falls between 0.08 and 0.10 in most states. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms. 0.05 -- reduced inhibitions 0.10 -- slurred speech 0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment 0.30 -- confusion 0.40 -- stupor 0.50 -- coma 0.60 -- respiratory paralysis and death You can have symptoms of ""being drunk"" at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached. HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL Alcohol increases the risk of: Alcoholism or alcohol dependence Falls, drownings, and other accidents Head, neck, stomach, and breast cancers Motor vehicle accidents Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Suicide and homicide Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or fetal alcohol syndrome are possible. RESPONSIBLE DRINKING If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1 ounces of liquor. Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant: Never drink alcohol and drive a car. If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi or bus. Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol. If you are taking medication, including over-the-counter drugs, check with your doctor before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective or dangerous or make you sick. Do not drink if you have a history of alcohol abuse or alcoholism. If alcoholism runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing alcoholism yourself, so you may want to avoid drinking alcohol altogether. CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF: You are concerned about your personal alcohol use or that of a family member You are interested in more information regarding alcohol use, alcohol abuse , or support groups , or support groups You are unable to reduce or stop your alcohol consumption, in spite of attempts to stop drinking Other resources include: Local Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-anon/Alateen groups Local hospitals Public or private mental health agencies School or work counselors Student or employee health centers References National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Tiger Woods sued after employee dies in car crash,"Nicholas Immesberger's family sued Tiger Woods, along with his girlfriend and his restaurant, after the 24-year-old bartender died in a crash.",,2019-05-14T12:04:00+05:30,India Today,"Tiger Woods was sued by his employees family, who died in car crash (Reuters Photo) The family of a US man who was employed at a restaurant owned by Tiger Woods, has sued the ace golfer, his girlfriend and his company, saying they should have prevented him from drinking too much and driving to his death. Nicholas Immesberger, 24, died on December 10, 2018 near the community of Port Salerno -- about 20 miles from The Woods Jupiter restaurant and bar, reports CNN. The lawsuit filed on Monday blames Woods, who owns the restaurant where Immesberger worked as a bartender, and Erica Herman, who is listed in the complaint as the general manager of business and is Woods girlfriend, for wrongful death. The suit, brought by the victims parents, said Immesberger finished his shift at 3 p.m., sat at the bar drinking and died in a single-car accident about 6 p.m. The civil complaint says Immesberger had a blood alcohol level of .256, three times the legal limit. A police report has said that he was driving an estimated 70 mph in a 55 mph zone. The suit alleges employees knew Immesberger attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and had another alcohol-related crash in November.

Alternative Names Alcohol in pregnancy; Alcohol-related birth defects; Fetal alcohol effects; FAS Causes, incidence, and risk factors Using or abusing alcohol during pregnancy can cause the same risks as using alcohol in general. However, it poses extra risks to the unborn baby. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it easily passes across the placenta to the fetus. Because of this, drinking alcohol can harm the babys development. A pregnant woman who drinks any amount of alcohol is at risk for having a child with fetal alcohol syndrome. No ""safe"" level of alcohol use during pregnancy has been established. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems. Binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol. Timing of alcohol use during pregnancy is also important. Alcohol use appears to be the most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy; however, drinking alcohol any time during pregnancy can be harmful. Symptoms A baby with fetal alcohol syndrome may have the following symptoms: Poor growth while the baby is in the womb and after birth Decreased muscle tone and poor coordination Delayed development and problems in three or more major areas: thinking, speech, movement, or social skills Heart defects such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) or atrial septal defect (ASD) or Problems with the face, including: Narrow, small eyes with large epicanthal folds Small head Small upper jaw Smooth groove in upper lip Smooth and thin upper lip Signs and tests A physical exam of the baby may show a heart murmur or other heart problems. As the baby grows, there may be signs of delayed mental development. There also may be problems with the face and bones. Tests include: Blood alcohol level in pregnant women who show signs of being drunk (intoxicated) Brain imaging studies (CT or MRI) after the child is born Pregnancy ultrasound Treatment Women who are pregnant or who are trying to get pregnant should avoid drinking any amount of alcohol. Pregnant women with alcoholism should join an alcohol abuse rehabilitation program and be checked closely by a health care provider throughout pregnancy. Support Groups The following organizations may offer assistance: National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency -- www.ncadd.org National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Routing Service -- 1-800-662-4357 The following organizations are good resources for information on alcoholism: Alcoholics Anonymous - www.alcoholics-anonymous.org Al-Anon/Alateen - www.al-anon.org National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism - www.niaaa.nih.gov/ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - www.samhsa.gov Expectations (prognosis) The outcome for infants with fetal alcohol syndrome varies. Almost none of these babies have normal brain development. Infants and children with fetal alcohol syndrome have many different problems, which can be difficult to manage. Children do best if they are diagnosed early and referred to a team of health care providers who can work on educational and behavioral strategies that fit the childs needs. Complications Drinking alcohol during pregnancy may result in: Miscarriage or stillbirth or Premature delivery Complications seen in the infant may include: Abnormal heart structure Behavior problems Infant death Intellectual disability Problems in the structure of the head, eyes, nose, or mouth Poor growth before birth Slow growth and poor coordination after birth Calling your health care provider Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you are drinking alcohol regularly or heavily, and are finding it difficult to cut back or stop. Also, call if you are drinking alcohol in any amount while you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Prevention Avoiding alcohol during pregnancy prevents fetal alcohol syndrome. Counseling can help women who have already had a child with fetal alcohol syndrome. Sexually active women who drink heavily should use birth control and control their drinking behaviors, or stop using alcohol before trying to get pregnant. References Carlo WA.

Drink dependence up in urban Indian women,The 33-year-old married woman from Chandigarh had never imagined that her excessive clubbing and partying would one day push her to the brink of suicide. But it did.,,2012-11-30T17:24:51+05:30,India Today,"The 33-year-old married woman from Chandigarh had never imagined that her excessive clubbing and partying would one day push her to the brink of suicide. But it did. She was not the only one. In an increasing trend of urban women taking to alcohol to cope with everyday stresses as societal norms ease, a 28-year-old woman working as a senior executive in a property broking firm in Mumbai also developed suicidal tendencies. What started for both the Bacchus lovers as socialising, ended up in drink dependence and pushed them into the infamous club of over 14 million alcohol consumers in the country who require help. Though there are no exact figures of how many of these are women, the trend is clear. The Mumbai woman ran up a debt of Rs25 lakh (Rs2.5 million) and attempted suicide due to her ""unmanageable"" life and depression. The Chandigarh woman showed addiction- related suicidal tendencies after a turbulent married life, extra-marital affairs and a failed patch-up bid with her husband. The two are now trying to get a grip over their lives and move away from drink dependence, with some help from de-addiction experts who say they needed to be cared like brain patients who dont know how to prevent themselves from returning to the old habit despite being aware of its perils. But their difficult phase is over, says NGO Tulasi Homes consultant doctor Goruv Gupta. ""Realising or accepting that one needs help is the toughest part of getting over the drink dependence problem."" Sociologist Sachin Kumar, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, told IANS: ""Intoxication by women in some communities has existed for time immemorial. Traditionally, it has been a collective activity but in modern times the incidence of individual drinking has shown a rise."" The social checks or restraint that used to prescribe the limit of alcohol consumption in older times have faded over the years, leading to worst forms of drink dependence among both men and women, he said. According to a 2009 article in journal The Lancet, Indians, officially, are still among the worlds lowest consumers of alcohol - government statistics show only 21 percent of adult men and around two percent of women drink. But up to a fifth of this group - about 14 million people - are dependent drinkers requiring ""help"". ""Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease, characterised by compulsive alcohol seeking and use, and by neurochemical and molecular changes in the brain,"" said Gupta. For women drinkers, the news is worse than for men. Gupta warned that alcohol addiction was more harmful for a womans body as compared to a man; in a woman, alchohol tends to induce permanent hormonal changes in the body, making rehabilitation more difficult. The problem of shortage of de-addiction centres was also more acute for women. Ruchika Kumari, who works at several private de-addiction centres in Delhi, agreed: ""Alcohol addiction is considered to carry a bigger social stigma for women as compared to men and the challenge of weaning away is tougher for them due to shortage of fully-equipped centres."" ""Families need to leave the women dependent drinkers at deaddiction centres for medical aid and counselling and this needs a lot of faith in the facility,"" she said. ""Most people prefer private facilities as they score over the government sector in terms of security, hygiene and quality of treatment."" She revealed that there was no particular age bracket for women drinkers. ""At our centre in south Delhi, we have women from 48 years to 28 years seeking counselling."" The service that private centres offer to get rid of dependence comes at a price. A six-week rehabilitation procedure in some of the high-end centres in Delhi costs around Rs1 lakh (Rs100,000). In Delhi alone there are over three dozen NGO-run, private and government facilities that offer help to people with drink dependence. Gupta warned against ill-trained quacks offering help to dependent drinkers and ending up traumatising the patient. ""I have seen a case where a patient was sent by his family to a private facility in Haryana and there he was tortured, stripped and humiliated in the name of de-addiction,"" he said.",{},"['women', 'deaddiction', 'help', 'private', 'drinkers', 'centres', 'alcohol', 'dependence', 'indian', 'woman', 'urban', 'drink']","""Realising or accepting that one needs help is the toughest part of getting over the drink dependence problem.""

Alternative Names DTs; Alcohol withdrawal - delirium tremens Causes Delirium tremens can occur when you stop drinking alcohol after a period of heavy drinking, especially if you do not eat enough food. Delirium tremens may also be caused by head injury, infection, or illness in people with a history of heavy alcohol use. It is most common in people who have a history of alcohol withdrawal . It is especially common in those who drink 4 - 5 pints of wine or 7 - 8 pints of beer (or 1 pint of ""hard"" alcohol) every day for several months. Delirium tremens also commonly affects people who have had an alcohol habit or alcoholism for more than 10 years. Symptoms Symptoms most often occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. However, they may occur up to 7 - 10 days after the last drink. Symptoms may get worse quickly, and can include: Body tremors Changes in mental function Agitation, irritability Confusion , disorientation , disorientation Decreased attention span Deep sleep that lasts for a day or longer Delirium Excitement Fear Hallucinations (seeing or feeling things that are not really there) (seeing or feeling things that are not really there) Increased activity Quick mood changes Restlessness , excitement , excitement Sensitivity to light, sound, touch Stupor , sleepiness, fatigue Seizures (may occur without other symptoms of DTs) Most common in first 12 - 48 hours after last drink Most common in people with past complications from alcohol withdrawal Usually generalized tonic-clonic seizures Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including: Anxiety Depression Fatigue Feeling jumpy or nervous Feeling shaky Headache Insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep) Irritability or excitability Loss of appetite Nausea Pale skin Palpitations (sensation of feeling the heart beat) (sensation of feeling the heart beat) Rapid emotional changes Sweating , especially on the palms of the hands or the face , especially on the palms of the hands or the face Vomiting Other symptoms that may occur: Chest pain Fever Stomach pain Exams and Tests Delirium tremens is a medical emergency. The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Signs may include: Heavy sweating Increased startle reflex Irregular heartbeat Problems with eye muscle movement Rapid heart rate Rapid muscle tremors The following tests may be done: Blood magnesium level Blood phosphate level Comprehensive metabolic panel Electrocardiogram (ECG) (ECG) Electroencephalogram (EEG) Toxicology screen Treatment The goals of treatment are to: Save the persons life Relieve symptoms Prevent complications A hospital stay is needed. The health care team will regularly check: Blood chemistry results, such as electrolyte levels Body fluid levels Vital signs (temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, blood pressure) Symptoms such as agitation, seizures, and irregular heartbeat are treated with the following medications: Sedatives such as diazepam or lorazepam Anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital The patient may need to be put into a sedated state for a week or more until withdrawal and DTs are finished. Benzodiazepine medications such as diazepam or lorazepam also help treat seizures, anxiety, and tremors. Antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol may sometimes be needed for persons with severe psychotic symptoms, especially if they have an underlying problem such as schizophrenia. However, these drugs should be avoided if possible because they may contribute to seizures. Long-term preventive treatment should begin after the patient recovers from immediate symptoms. This may involve a ""drying out"" period, in which no alcohol is allowed. Total and lifelong avoidance of alcohol (abstinence) is recommended for most people who go through withdrawal. The person should receive treatment for alcohol use or alcoholism, including: Counseling Support groups (such as Alcoholics Anonymous) The patient should be tested, and if needed, treated for other medical problems that can occur with alcohol use. Such problems may include: Alcoholic cardiomyopathy Alcoholic liver disease Alcoholic neuropathy Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome Support Groups For additional resources, see alcoholism support group .

'Alcoholism is no respector of any human being',Alcoholism is no respector of any human being,,2014-02-03T12:34:53+05:30,India Today,"Stormy Crusader The people of Pakistan (""Storming the Citadel"", May 15) have ultimately found a crusader in Benazir Bhutto to resuscitate authentic democracy in their country. This was evident from the spectacular welcome and ovation they gave Miss Sahiba when she arrived in Lahore. Bangalore K. Chidanand Kumar General Zia would do well to remember that those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable. Amritsar Kamal Jit Singh Ahluwalia For a leader who is still in the process of maturing into a world leader, to say that she will be able to do in Pakistan what Cory Aquino did in the Philippines shows how impetuous she can be. She is right in that people want change but to be able to offer the people something concrete she has to still do a lot of spadework. Arrah Ayyaz Parvez Babus Courage The manner in which Rajiv Gandhi expelled Pranab Mukherjee from the party suggests that he is losing control of himself (""Pre-emptive Strike"", May 15). He thought that expulsion would kill dissidence but Pranab babus is not the voice of dissent but the voice of courage. Calcutta, Prahlad Ghosh Deserving Win The outcome of the Australasia Tournament (""Drama in the Desert"", May 15) need not be seen as a defeat for India. Miandad deserved to win as his performance was simply superb. Bhatkal Aftab Husain Kola Devils Brew The need of the hour (""A Growing Malaise"", April 30) is to create awareness that addiction spoils the health slowly, spends the wealth rapidly, reduces lifespan secretly and produces a national loss unknowingly. Sonepat K. Gopakumar Menon Alcoholism is sometimes a response to an intolerable situation which can be made more bearable by drinking. Hence the right cure would be to find the root of the problem instead of fighting it with drugs or aversion therapy. Shimla Vivek Mohan I am a self-confessed alcoholic. Alcoholism is no respector of any human being. I took my first drink thinking it would bring me more pleasure, more friends, more status but this was only a pleasant delusion. The last five years of my sojourn with alcohol were terrible. I pawned and sold everything to buy more alcohol. I made countless resolutions, broke every one, was hospitalised thrice and underwent psychiatric treatment. Nothing made a difference. Only Alcoholics Anonymous did. Their one day at a time rule is indeed a golden rule. Bombay Ganesh Drinking has become a social necessity and mans social status seems to rise or fall with the quality and quantity of liquor he is able to hand out. A non-drinker finds himself isolated at any function and to be accepted as a civilised individual he begins to drink. Even more distressing is the fact that youngsters have taken to it in a big way simply because it is equated with manliness. Chandrapur Prakash Prabharat I believe that Hindi films contribute largely to the growing popular appeal of drinking in this country. Nearly every film has the hero guzzling booze (generally a bottle of Vat 69) and looking very pleased with himself. The same man is shown young and carefree, dancing with the heroine, righting all manner of people in the most outrageous situations for his self-respect. And finally comes tragedy. The audience identifies with him and imitates him completely, even throwing back drinks like he did, not bothering to see the bottle for its evil. Rajkot D.P. Bhatt The cover story did not shock, it only surprised. It is only expected that alcoholism will increase with population. This means that there is more frustration and deterioration of morals. Eradication is impossible. Bombay S.E. Meeuza An alcoholic is not just the problem of his family but should also be the concern of the society in general. As he is a public nuisance, neighbours should join together to humiliate him. This method has been successful in Manipur, where the women have got together to deal with the problem. Nagpur Manoj Bire Alcoholism is a socially accepted evil which has assumed insidious dimensions. Only a mass-based movement, which by its very nature enjoys wide popular backing, can help the people in their battle against the bottle. Pathankot Ravi Kant Bhatia Your intention to educate people about alcoholism is well-timed. Arrack sale legalised a few years back in Tamil Nadu has unfortunately increased the number of its consumers. Alcoholics, many of them in a highly inebriated state, can now be seen drinking till the wee hours in arrack shops. The income generated is enormous and all this at the expense of the working class whose women and children suffer. Nandanam Franklyn Stanley Considering the climate in this country, alcohol is injurious to drinkers. But the state governments will not bring in total prohibition. The lobby of vested interests argues that prohibition will only be an incentive to illicit distilling and bootlegging, which is a loss to the Government. This is a fallacious argument for the brewing of raw drink is common and uncontrolled. Illicit distillation is mainly on economic grounds and has nothing to do with prohibition. Bombay D.P. Birla In north-eastern India alcohol has become the root cause of all evil in society. Country liquor is cheaply and freely available and has devastating effects. Facilities for de-addiction should be provided in this part of the country too. Shillong J. Gondalia Absurd Reading Reading your story ""Communal Cauldron"", April 30), one would imagine that the Hindus went on a rampage merely because they were working under the Muslims who controlled the business. That sounds absurd because the losses of the other community have not been considered a loss, and neither has the viewpoint of the oppressing community been taken. Had there been violence on the scale you write about there would have been a retaliatory strike. Rishra, West Bengal Raghuraman C. The communal violence in Verawal was impartially handled. But it took place on March 26 and not the day after as mentioned. Verawal Anwar Balooch Just Solution Carried away by their ambitious plans to beautify Bombay (""Eviction Problems"", April 30), the authorities have unfeelingly tread on the dreams of the slum dwellers. Shabana Azmis timely intervention has helped in one case. Collectively all sympathetic people can see that justice is done. Bangalore Eliezer S. Ambler The scientist Homi Sethna mentioned in your story was not the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and now chairman of the Tata Oil Mills Company. Our chairman did not join the group led by Shabana Azmi protesting the eviction of slum dwellers in Bombay. New Delhi M.Z.A. Baig Black Politicos One hoped that the CBI would move onto politicians after raiding the bureaucracy (""Exposing the Bureaucracy"", April 30). Politics in India is the biggest black market business. Politicians with declared incomes of less than Rs 3,000 lead extravagant lives. They shout about black money in public but pocket their share in private. Patna Mo. Ehtesham A. Usmani Gimmicky Rule Rama Raos political style (""Governor Row"", April 30) is only an extension of his filmy past. He should pay more attention to the declining law and order situation in the state instead of resorting to filmy gimmicks to divert peoples attention from his inadequacies. Sonepur C. Sujata Money Mad The problem plaguing the Congress(I) (""Conciliatory Moves"", April 30) is that many of its leaders live only for power and money. If they dont get their share they begin to grumble. Cuddalore R.V. Jayaraman Living Treasure It was sheer pleasure to watch a legend in multiple facets (""A Lonely Journey"". April 30) through the eyes of a connoisseur. Each frame was an experience. Roorkee Seema Arora The new photo essay on the living legends of Indian arts and music is a welcome addition. I hope the stalwarts of Carnatic music will be adequately represented. Madras J.N. Iyer There cannot be a debate about the greatness of Pandit Ravi Shankar. He is a showman but that is what makes him popular and his experimentation is only an extension of his versatility. Bombay Anshuman Vora Tiger Problems The problems confronting tigers, particularly those in the Dudhwa National Park (""Conflict in the Wild"", April 30) have been highlighted well. But the incident of the burning of tiger carcass actually happened a year ago. Lucknow Zafar Jordan Womans Grouse With reference to your report ""Syrian Christians: Womens Victory"" (March 31), the Supreme Court struck down the Travancore Christian Succession Act of 1916. The Cochin Christian Succession Act still exists. There never was a Travancore-Cochin Christian succession act. I am not divorced. Twenty years ago I walked out on my alcoholic husband, but have not seriously considered divorce. And I was not thrown out of my fathers bungalow. I stayed on and the bungalow now belongs to me.

IAF faces HC ire for confining corporal to psychiatric ward for alcohol dependency,,,2018-07-12T19:13:00+05:30,India Today,"New Delhi, Jul 12 (PTI) The Indian Air Force (IAF) faced the ire of the Delhi High Court today for confining one of its non-commissioned officers, a corporal, to a psychiatric ward for over two months, because he was an alcoholic and suffered from mental disorders. A bench of justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel questioned the rationale behind the IAFs decision, asking how it determined on a daily basis that the corporal still ""craved for alcohol"". The court also said the newly-enacted Mental Health Act made it clear that a person could not be forced to undergo treatment without his consent, adding that the IAF ""cannot ignore the laws of the country"". Terming the conduct of the IAF ""irresponsible"", the bench wondered how many of such cases there might be, which were yet to be highlighted. ""How were you determining on a daily basis that his craving for alcohol had not gone down? What tests were conducted by you? This is completely irresponsible. We wonder how many such cases are there. ""This is a clear case where a man is saying he has been detained without consent. Under the new Mental Health Act, you cannot force him to undergo treatment without his consent. Then how are you pumping him full of drugs? We do not know who should be proceeded against,"" the bench said. It added that the IAF needed to be reminded not to interfere with a persons liberty as ""short of chaining him up, everything else was done here"" and directed that the corporal be produced in court tomorrow. According to the IAF, represented by the Centres standing counsel, Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj, the action against the corporal was taken on a complaint from his wife that he turned violent after consuming alcohol. Bhardwaj said the corporal, Kriyad Yogesh Bhankhariya, had alcohol dependency issues for which he was initially treated in the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital here and thereafter, in June, he was shifted to the medical centre at the Tughlakabad Air Force Station. The court said if the non-commissioned officer (NCO) was an alcoholic, then the IAF ought to have sought the help of the ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" on how to deal with the matter as any psychiatric would confirm that confinement of a person was advisable only in extreme cases. ""It is worrying, the manner in which you have approached the situation,"" the bench told the IAF. The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the 30-year-old corporals father, claiming that his son was being illegally confined at the Army Base Hospital.

Is the 12-step programme any good for sex addiction?,,,2010-09-08T15:11:36+05:30,India Today,"Vaccine benefits elude older women Vitamin B helps the brain American researchers have found that vitamin B3, or niacin, a common water- soluble vitamin, can "" rewire"" the brain by improving blood vessels in patients. Rats with ischemic stroke given niacin "" sprouted"" nerve cells, which greatly improved their neurological functions. Scientists said this finding could result in the development of a new low cost treatment for stroke patients. The results of this study may also open doors in other areas of neurological medicine, including brain injury. Past studies into B vitamins have indicated that they can help to prevent heart attacks and strokes. How much is too much, and when does any habit become ""excessive"", be this eating, drinking, shopping or sex? The answer, say therapists, lies in whether this behaviour damages your life in any way. It was Clinton who first offered us a glimpse of how sex can ruin a persons life. More recently, Tiger Woodss string of sexual escapades has confirmed this idea that out of control sexual behaviour which seems addictive can have far-reaching consequences.Sex addiction is being recognised as a problem the world over but in the Indian context, very little research has been done on this problem and its treatment. Experts say that this is because sex is still a taboo subject in our culture. ""Ours is a predominantly patriarchal society in which a sexual problem or addiction is considered an affront to masculinity so a man suffering from sex addiction is simply hailed as virile,"" says Dr Rachna Singh, consultant psychologist, Artemis Health Institute.Undoubtedly sex addiction has to be defined carefully as a person might have a high libido, nothing more, and his sexual needs might not match his partners, which leads to him being branded unfairly as an addict. ""There are no clear cut lines to define what too much sex is. If a man with a high libido finds a match in his partner then there is no problem. But when the desire to have sex takes over a persons life and renders it dysfunctional, then the psychological and physical condition should be analysed,"" says Dr Wadia.While the idea that anyone can be addicted to sex is still scoffed at, using this as a medical excuse for promiscuous behavior makes the matter more controversial. Especially since this is not even recognised as a disorder by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), considered the psychiatrists Bible and ""hypersexual disorder"" is under consideration for the next edition.Woods recently offered a public apology for his infidelity, saying he was returning to his religious faith and admitting that he had ""work to do."" This declaration appeared to be in the line of the steps advocated by a de-addiction programme called the 12-step approach. This universally-accepted plan was first formulated by Alcoholics Anonymous and has since then been adopted by Narcotics Anonymous, Sex Addicts Anonymous and groups for gambling, food and shopping addictions. Alcoholics Anonymous is the largest of all the twelve-step programs, followed by Narcotics Anonymous.Woodss apology last week to his family and his wifes family, his business partners and sponsors, and parents who ""used to point to me as a role model for their kids,"" seemed to be in line with steps 8 and 9 of the programme, which advocate listing everyone harmed and the making of amends.The 12-step is intended to provide psychological, social and spiritual support for addicts. Crucial to this is the admission that their addiction isnt in their control and that there is a greater power that can give strength. Past mistakes are rectified with the help of a sponsor who is an experienced member. The final step is to learn to live a new life with a new code of behaviour and help others who suffer from the same addictions or compulsions. ""We use many of the principles of the 12-step in our counselling ,"" declares Elizabeth Selhore, director of Sahara, an NGO that runs a rehabilitation programme for drug and alcohol addiction. Selhore admits that while sex addiction is not "" acknowledged"" in India, it is a problem nonetheless. ""Anything can become an addiction, including love and sex.""Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling are typically used to deal with addictive behaviour. According to Dr Samir Malhotra, HOD psychiatry at Fortis Noida, people with addictions avoid seeking professional help. ""Groups like AA are not very active. But many elements of the 12-step programme are a part of recovery programmes, even though people may not follow the exact 12 steps. Systems of recovery vary and the patients personality and circumstances as well as environment needs to be evaluated especially where sex addiction is concerned,"" says Malhotra.The pros and cons of the 12-step are debatable. One of the biggest advantages is the sense of community and belonging that it offers those struggling with addiction. It destigmatises addiction and helps a person accept responsibility for their dependence on drugs, alcohol or sex. Following the plan costs nothing and a person can count on it.One of the arguments against the programme is that it focuses on the emotional and spiritual, and neglects the physical. ""But thats why its important to create your own plan based on some of the principles only,"" counters Selhore. Saharas plan includes vigorous physical activity and the NGO has its own football team which competes in country level tournaments.Calling yourself an addict is essential in the 12-step plan. This admission is hard for some, as is the social involvement that is part of the plan. Many people struggling with addiction find this hard to deal with as it makes them uncomfortable or nervous. The public confessional approach is another area of the programme that may make people cringe. Some feel that the need for belief in a Higher Power which is integral for those following the plan also comes in the way of its universal applicability and efficacy. Selhore doesnt agree though. ""The programme talks of God or a Higher Power but doesnt give any name to this power, so its applicable to everyone and it doesnt matter whether you are a Christian or Hindu.""",{},"['problem', 'good', 'plan', 'addiction', 'life', 'power', 'sexual', 'selhore', 'sex', 'programme', '12step']","This declaration appeared to be in the line of the steps advocated by a de-addiction programme called the 12-step approach.

'Alcohol has ruined my life',Maben became a chronic alcoholic and began sleeping with a bottle under his pillow. He started absenting himself from work regularly. His increments and promotions were stopped.,,2014-01-27T16:20:01+05:30,India Today,"Maben: back from the brink Maben: back from the brink 49, a machine operator in a Bangalore factory, began drinking heavily 15 years ago after he was superseded at work and his youngest son, Dinakar, died the same year. Maben recalls: ""At work I had no peace and at home I was unhappy. Booze was the only way I could forget my sorrows."" Instead it brought him more. Maben became a chronic alcoholic and began sleeping with a bottle under his pillow. He started absenting himself from work regularly. His increments and promotions were stopped. With liquor burning up all his money, Maben was invariably broke. His favourite clarinet, guitar and camera found their way to the local pawn shop, as did his wife Evelyns jewellery, including her mangalsutra. The worst came when he was evicted from his rented two-bedroom house. Arun, his son, remembers that incident with a shudder and says: ""I can never forget how ashamed I was. All our furniture and clothes were lying on the footpath. I just ran to my friends house and hid."" Someone suggested that he send Rs 50 to St Francis Xaviers tomb in Goa, but that did not help. Nor did money sent to Tirupati Temple, or consulting a Mantravadi, who made him wear a charm around his waist and charged him Rs 1,000 for his pains. He was admitted to NIMHANS as many as 18 times for treatment, and the doctors refused to admit him any more. Frustration and desperation drove him to drink a bottle of varnish last year, which nearly killed him. After that he vowed to give up drinking and over a period of one year, Mabens transformation has been dramatic. He has started doing yoga, which helps him sleep well. He goes to work regularly. At home things have improved considerably, and Evelyn now goes shopping with him - something they had not done for years. Every Sunday all of them sing bhajans at a nearby spiritual centre. Daughter Chandrika says: ""There is so much peace at home now."" Narayan, 44, a peon in a bank in Madurai is not so happy. An alcoholic for the past 10 years, Narayan was brought in a delirious state to the TTRC for treatment last month. His office had suspended him for coming drunk to work and warned him that unless he gave up drinking they would dismiss him. While Narayan is still unable to speak coherently about his addiction, his wife Malini, who faced the brunt of his drunken bouts, has a sorry tale to narrate. She remembers that initially when Narayan drank she thought he was just trying to forget his worries. But soon he was coming home drunk every day, beating her regularly, and always in a foul mood. He threw away the food she made for him, he was nasty with the children and prevented them from studying at night. He did not give her money and pawned all her jewellery. She was forced to take up work as domestic help to feed the children. And when her children worried her for money to see films, she told them sharply: ""Your father is taking my life out of me, now you dont start."" The office suspended Narayan several times, but Malini used to go and fall at the bank managers feet and beg for mercy. Meanwhile Narayan became so weak that according to Malini ""he is now only eyes and stomach. I dont know how much longer he would live."" Anand, 33, unlike Narayan who has not yet lost his job, finds his life has been completely shattered and is only now beginning to pick up the pieces. Anand has been an alcoholic for the past 13 years. Last year his wife walked out on him, taking their two children with her. Immediately after that he lost his job as a sales executive in a Delhi travel agency. Anand, the son of an air force officer, started drinking when in his second year at college in Nagpur. Since his father was in the armed forces, drinking was considered normal. Anand found himself increasingly attending parties where liquor was served and he says: ""I used to be the first to start drinking and the last to leave. I had a tremendous capacity, and even if I had five large pegs I would never get drunk."" After graduation, his job as a sales executive offered even more opportunities to drink and, as he puts it: ""It was an ideal job for an alcoholic, became a 24-hour drinker."" For a while he thought he could handle his liquor and he made sure that his work was not affected. When his wife, a doctor, told him to give up drinking, he said: ""I thought she was a bloody nag and I used to get the feeling that the whole world was after my blood."" Soon he became irregular at work and extremely irritable at home, hitting his wife once in anger. Thats when she left him. He was forced to give up his job because, as he says: ""I couldnt handle two careers at one time: my drinking and my job."" Last year he touched rock bottom: I had become like a caged tiger. I didnt know how to escape and all I did was hide myself in the bottle."" He finally joined an Alcoholics Anonymous group in Delhi, and now he says: ""My obsession is gone. But Im not going to take up a job till Im fully recovered."" David: groping for help David: groping for help 32, a packer in a Bombay firm, has had equally traumatic experiences with alcohol. Living in a dirty slum in Ghatkopar, David, who looks older than his age, is slowly recovering from the damaging effects of alcohol. His speech is still slurred and he gropes for words. His hands tremble uncontrollably. Doctors attending on him say his brain has suffered some damage and it may be a year before he is able to recover.David, who is married and has two children, remembers that he started drinking when he was around 15 years old: ""At that time we drank because after a hard days work we had nothing to do and we wanted to forget the strain of living."" Initially he drank only on week-ends, but: ""After some time all I did was to drink, drink and sleep.  He refused to go to work, and last year was absent for 140 days. His office sent him a charge-sheet, which he ignored. His entire pay packet of Rs 1,000 went towards liquor: I used to be so desperate that I even sold my shoes and shirt."" His wife left him twice to go and live with her father. David was admitted last month to the KEM Hospital for severe withdrawal symptoms of alcohol like hallucinations and shakes.

The baby out with the bathwater,The BMC in its most shameless display of abuse of power has now decided to throw out more than 200 such NGOs that operate from its civic schools.,,2013-10-14T09:54:42+05:30,India Today,"The BMC talks of opening more English medium classrooms but, over the years, the standard of education has fallen to such an extent that parents are simply not sending their children to civic schools. Remember Shweta Katti? The 18-year-old who was living in Kamathipura, Mumbais red light district, is now pursuing a course in Psychology at Bard University in the US. Katti lived most of her life in Kamathipura and braved sexual assaults and other discrimination to go to the US simply because NGOs like Indian Association for Promotion and Adoption of child welfare (IAPA), Kranti and many other organisations were involved in giving her the guidance like providing education, counseling and guidance and financial help. Katti could however be the last girl at least from Mumbai to benefit simply because the BMC in its most shameless display of abuse of power has now decided to throw out more than 200 such NGOs that operate from its civic schools. So the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deaf blind, IAPA and Alcoholics Anonymous all would have to vacate civic schools in the next few months. All these NGOs do not interfere in the functioning of the civic schools in Mumbai, and in fact occupy just a few classrooms that are anyway unused simply because most were anyway lying vacant. These trusts and NGOs have been working since almost the 1980s however now with space being a premium in Mumbai, the BMC however now has woken up and has decided that these NGOs are to be evicted. Officially the Civic bodys reasoning is this- The NGO;s pay less rent, and the NGO s are not engaged in the business of education. The BMC wants the class rooms because then they could set up more English medium class rooms, and in others they would hold libraries and laboratories for civic schools. The BMCs claim is is anything but hilarious: the civic body talks of opening more English medium classrooms but, over the years, the standard of education has fallen to such an extent that parents are simply not sending their children to civic schools. In fact even parents from the lower social strata prefer to send their kids to private schools, even though the fees are high and it is a strain on their monthly budget. So while the civic body talks of upgrading the English medium schools, the fact remains that the civic bodys dismal education standard has fallen to such an extent that there are many parents who are just not putting their children in civic run Marathi medium schools, forcing many of them to shut down. Make no mistake after having these NGOs vacate these schools, the BMC is not going to open more English medium schools or labs or libraries but will be letting it out to educational institutes who charge a bomb for education children and coaching classes. We are supposed to trust the same BMC that year after year allots the same road contractors money to build roads that dont last even till the first monsoon showers. The BMC that ignores structural changes done in a building, even though it knows that it would lead to the building collapsing and killing people residing in it. It is clear that the NGOs and other social organisations are being evicted simply because a few in the BMC have realised that these properties could be exploited to make another fast buck. So far the many Shweta Kattis out there, tough luck, if you manage to stay in the same rut and get exploited or worse, turn into sex workers, you can blame your fate or the BMC. === Actor Ranveer Singh just got released from a hospital after suffering from dengue. The disease that is spread through mosquitoes has reached such alarming levels that more than a thousand have been affected. The BMC however claims only 615 people in the city have been affected and only six have died - basing this on figures of only those who were admitted in civic hospitals. === A sweet scam in Mumbais mills Social activists Anna Hazare and Medha Patkar have alleged a Rs 10,000 crore scam in the sale of sugar mills in Mumbai. Hazare and Patkar have alleged that the sugar mills, all of which were sick, were sold off for just Rs 12 crores to Rs 108 crores. While the mills were sick, there does appear to be a hint of a scam as the sugar cooperatives have hundreds of acres of land which meant that they should have been sold for a higher price. Incidentally most of these sugar mills have been bought by politicians or controlled by them. From NCP leader and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar, PWD Minister Chagggan Bhujbal to Rural Development Minister Jayant Patil, all got the mills at a cheap rate than their actual valuation allege Hazare and co. Interestingly the Congress, which usually gloats on allegations against the NCP, is silent because even some of its own leaders have allegedly benefited. The BJP too is silent because its former National Chief Nitin Gadkari is also an alleged beneficiary. === A day in the life of a Mumbai constable Last week a video went viral of a model-cum-actress who was caught on camera abusing the Mumbai police and the police commissioner, all because the cops had gone to her residence asking her to lower her volume in the night as her neighbours had complained. What was interesting in the video was the old constable who stood stone-faced without even as much as saying shut up to the belligerent girl. Many felt sorry for the constable, who kept all his anger on check because there was a woman in front of him. Since they could not detain the girl without a lady constable, the model kept on abusing and humiliating the constable who stood like the Buddha. While the Mumbai police are a much maligned lot, the above incident illustrates the challenges that the lower rung of the police - derogatorily called pandus - have to face almost daily. Most of the life of a constable in Mumbai is spent either in the police station or on bandobast duty. He is seldom at home, all his Dusseheras, Diwalis and New years are spent ensuring that people do not drunken drive, kill people or molest women. In fact since they are severely short staffed the constables many times end up working for more than 30 hours non stop. In spite of all of this if there is a untoward incident in their jurisdiction then these constables and their seniors like Inspectors and Senior Inspectors get abused by their superiors, not unlike the treatment meted out by the model.",{},"['baby', 'schools', 'bmc', 'ngos', 'medium', 'simply', 'mumbai', 'english', 'education', 'mills', 'civic', 'bathwater']","So the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deaf blind, IAPA and Alcoholics Anonymous all would have to vacate civic schools in the next few months.

"New FTII director hints at crackdown on ragging, alcoholism","New FTII director hints at crackdown on ragging, alcoholism",,2016-05-13T16:55:42+05:30,India Today,"Pune, May 13 (PTI) After witnessing a prolonged unrest, Film And Television Institute of India may be revamped as its new director Bhupendra Kainthola today hinted towards a crackdown on ragging and alcoholism on the campus. Spelling out his pro-student measures to improve atmosphere on the campus after the scene of 139-day-long strike on the issue of chairmanship of TV actor Gajendra Chauhan drew nought, Kainthola said he would have a ""zero tolerance"" policy for rampant ragging and alcoholism in the premiere institute. ""Although I have not received official complaints of ragging, during my interaction with students, particularly females, I have perceived it is happening and they are scared to go on record to say it. Actually, it has resulted in a decline in the number of female students seeking admission to FTII,"" he told PTI here. Kainthola, who succeeded Prashant Pathrabe recently, said alcoholism too was taking toll on the health of the students and that he had also ""heard"" of instances of drug abuse on the campus. ""We are going to have a zero tolerance policy for all this. If necessary we will rope in institutions such as Alcoholic Anonymous and de-addiction therapists,"" he said. Outlining his priorities, the FTII director said a revision of the three-year syllabus was underway and he would ensure that the students completed their three year course without spilling over the prescribed timeline. ""We are recruiting new faculty members and we shall also approach famous film industry personalities to interact with the students as visiting faculty in order to impart practical experience for the would-be industry professionals being trained at the FTII,"" he added. Asked whether the FTII management had any plans to withdraw the cases filed against a group of students booked in connection with the gherao of former director Pathrabe during the heated atmosphere of the strike against Chauhans appointment, Kainthola said any decision in the matter would be taken after due deliberations.

New studies: Drug abuse among women is no longer a fringe issue,New studies on substance abuse among women convey a scary message: drug abuse among women is no longer a fringe issue.,,2012-08-08T13:19:39+05:30,India Today,"The sensational bust of big-time cocaine-seller Ali and businessman Neeraj Wadhera in Delhi last year may have exposed the citys social underbelly. But the most startling revelation was the number of coke-snorting women who figured among Alis rich clients. However, the case did nothing to dispel the widely held notion that women hooked to drugs belonged to two extreme ends of the social scale. One, a battered slum dweller or a humiliated sex worker for whom drug addiction means survival. The other, a rich, high society woman who copes with the ""pressures of a demanding life"" by taking drugs. The glaring omission in the guesstimates was the number of educated, working, middle-class women hooked to drugs. Now, there are definite indicators based on recent trends. Two new studies released last week by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) and the South Asia regional office of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) as part of a national survey on drug abuse in India, bust the myths around ""the type of women who take drugs"". The theme is academic but the message is clear and alarming-drug abuse among women is not a fringe issue anymore. A Rapid Assessment Study conducted in nine urban areas as part of the UNDCP project reveals that younger, educated women are more prone to drugs, unsafe injecting methods and sexual practices. One of the findings was that a large number of female drug users were single: 75 per cent in Hyderabad, 60 per cent in Thiruvananthapuram and 75 per cent in Goa. The respondents from Goa were also highly educated (37 per cent were graduates). What may finally force one to look beyond cliched reasons for drug use is that taking drugs purely for pleasure was one of the reasons women cited for their addiction. The other study was conducted by Dr Pratima Murthy, associate professor of psychiatry at NIMHANS, Bangalore. ""The notion that women take drugs only because of stress is no longer the single, undisputed truth,"" she says, warning that the study figures should not be used to make generalisations about Indian society. However, she does agree that ""drug abuse is becoming popular in the urban middle classes, especially among those who represent Indias phase of transition"". It is also not just the snort of cocaine or the high of heroin that drives women, say mental health professionals. Abuse of prescription drugs from the benzodiazepine group like Alprax, Calmpose, Valium, Trika, Restill, Placedox and Alzolam is a growing trend. Natasha Singh-the Delhi-based socialite who reportedly consumed a heavy dose of Alprax on a regular basis and died after a fall from a hotel in March this year-obviously wasnt a solitary example. ""I see four to six cases every day involving either dependence on sedatives or abuse,"" says Delhi-based psychiatrist Sanjay Chugh, who thinks escapism is an inescapable urge among urban drug users. Take Namita. At 1.30 in the morning, just after a party, she realised she had run out of Calmpose. From a smart, amiable hostess in capris and figure-hugging top, Namita turned into an agitated woman who ""wanted"" Calmpose at any cost. ""I take it when I cant sleep, when Im tense, even when I want to have sex. Sometimes, I take it in the middle of a tension-spiked working day as well. I just cant do without it,"" she says. Murthys study covered Delhi, Mumbai and Aizawl and the findings of women on drugs fit the new profile. While the maximum number of women are hooked to brown sugar (see box), other preferred drugs are narcotic analgesics, tranquillisers, alcohol, cough syrups and cannabis. A fact reflected often in the newsmaking trends of Delhi. In Murthys study, however, it was in the Manipur capital of Aizawl that narcotic analgesics were the most preferred. According to a Mumbai-based psychotherapist, cocaine is favoured in the city as compared to prescription drugs or sedative painkillers. ""Cocaine reflects status as it is an expensive party drug and women are not sucked into judgmental traps by others in their groups because everybody is using it,"" she says. While most of the reasons behind women taking to drugs now mirror those of men, everyday life as a drug user or the journey into rehab and back to sobriety is lonelier and tougher for women. Sushma Bhatia*, a 37-year-old educated Delhi housewife, is an alcoholic and a drug addict with two kids and an alcoholic husband. Sharing her experiences in a womens chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Bhatia says her life as an alcoholic is far more devastating in terms of emotional and social consequences than a mans. Bhatia took to alcohol seven years ago when one day ""I was feeling completely rotten about myself and the way my husband behaved with me after he got drunk"". She experimented with cocaine as well. Soon, she would start drinking after sending her kids to school. One day, after a near-nervous breakdown, she collapsed and had to be carried to a rehab centre. ""Women no longer take drugs only due to stress but also for pleasure."" For 43-year-old Banita Muralidharan*, a corporate executive, the problem was only alcoholism. She was asked to quit on ""grounds of indecent behaviour"". Muralidharan, who is single, says her friends deserted her, making the urge to kick the addiction very difficult. ""Female addicts are seen as doubly deviant,"" explains Sheigla Murphy, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Studies at the California-based Institute for Scientific Analysis in a report published on the Internet. This is because traditional expectations of a self-sacrificing woman are at variance with that of a woman so selfish as to use drugs for her own pleasure. Seema Kejriwal*, who, as a supportive wife of an alcoholic, attends AA meetings, agrees. Kejriwal has stood by her husband, supporting him emotionally and financially for nine years as he battled with his addiction. ""We were reduced to poverty and I had to take a job to support us, leaving my two-year-old son with a man who could not tell the day from night,"" she says, adding that she is fully aware of the fact that had she been in the same situation, her husband would have thrown her out long ago. Compounding these problems are the effects of drugs on the physical and mental health of women. Studies have proved that women have a higher risk than men to addiction to certain drugs such as crack cocaine, even after casual or experimental use. In Murthys study, respondents reported insomnia, menstrual irregularities, depression and anxiety. Some even suffered miscarriages or were forced to undergo pregnancy terminations. ""Pregnant women who take alcohol or abuse drugs,"" says Delhi-based gynaecologist Sohani Verma, ""are also more prone to having children with congenital defects or Foetal Alcohol Syndrome. While pregnant women on drugs can go into premature labour, babies suffering from FA S are usually underweight and often have defects such as mental retardation, delayed development and, as they grow older, behaviour problems. A scary price to pay for a ""kick"" that only briefly masks the pain of reality.",{},"['women', 'study', 'cocaine', 'addiction', 'longer', 'social', 'fringe', 'issue', 'woman', 'drug', 'day', 'abuse', 'studies', 'drugs']","One, a battered slum dweller or a humiliated sex worker for whom drug addiction means survival.

Abruptly stopping the substance leads to withdrawal symptoms. Addiction means that a person has a strong urge to use the substance and cannot stop, even if they want to. Tolerance to a substance (needing a higher dose to get the same effect) is usually part of addiction. This disorder is also called substance abuse. Alternative Names Substance abuse; Chemical use; Chemical abuse; Drug addiction; Addiction - drug; Dependence on drugs Causes The exact cause of substance use disorder is not known. A persons genes, the action of the drug, peer pressure, emotional distress, anxiety , depression , and environmental stress can all be factors. At least half of those who become addicted have depression , attention deficit disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , or another mental problem. A stressful or chaotic lifestyle and low self-esteem are also common. Children who grow up seeing their parents using drugs may have a high risk of developing an addiction later in life for both environmental and genetic reasons. Commonly abused substances include: Opiates and narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness and sometimes intense feelings of well-being, elation, happiness, excitement, and joy. These include heroin, opium, codeine, and narcotic pain medicines that may be prescribed by a doctor or bought illegally. that may be prescribed by a doctor or bought illegally. Stimulants are drugs that stimulate the brain and nervous system. They include amphetamines, cocaine , and drugs used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin). A person can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect. , and drugs used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin). A person can start needing higher amounts of these drugs to feel the same effect. Depressants cause drowsiness and reduce anxiety. They include alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines (Valium, Ativan, Xanax), chloral hydrate, and paraldehyde. Using these substances can lead to addiction. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin (""mushrooms""), and phencyclidine (PCP or ""angel dust"") can cause a person to see things that are not there (hallucinations) and can lead to psychological addiction. Marijuana (cannabis) and hashish There are several stages of drug use that may lead to addiction. Young people seem to move more quickly through the stages than do adults. Stages are: Experimental use -- typically involves peers, done for recreational use; the user may enjoy defying parents or other authority figures. Regular use -- the user misses more and more school or work; worries about losing drug source; uses drugs to ""fix"" negative feelings; begins to stay away from friends and family; may change friends to those who are regular users; shows increased tolerance and ability to ""handle"" the drug. Problem or risky use -- the user loses any motivation; does not care about school and work; has obvious behavior changes; thinking about drug use is more important than all other interests, including relationships; the user becomes secretive; may begin dealing drugs to help support habit; use of other, harder drugs may increase; legal problems may increase. Addiction (dependence) -- cannot face daily life without drugs; denies problem; physical condition gets worse; loss of ""control"" over use; may become suicidal; financial and legal problems get worse; may have broken ties with family members or friends. Symptoms Symptoms and behaviors of drug useinclude: Confusion Continuing to use drugs even when health, work, or family are being harmed Episodes of violence Hostility when confronted about drug dependence Lack of control over drug abuse - being unable to stop or reduce alcohol intake Making excuses to use drugs Missing work or school, or a decrease in performance Need for daily or regular drug use to function Neglecting to eat Not caringabout physical appearance No longer taking part in activities because of drug abuse Secretive behavior to hide drug use Using drugs even when alone Exams and Tests Drug tests (toxicology screens) on blood and urine samples can show many chemicals and drugs in the body. How sensitive the test is depends on the drug itself, when the drug was taken, and the testing laboratory. Blood tests are more likely to find a drug than urine tests, though urine drug screens are done more often. Treatment Substance use disorder is a serious condition and not easy to treat. The best care and treatment involves trained professionals. Treatmentbegins with recognizing the problem. Though ""denial"" is a common symptom of addiction, people who are addicted have far less denial if they are treated with empathy and respect, rather than told what to do or being confronted. The substance may either be slowly withdrawn or stopped abruptly. Support for physical and emotional symptoms, as well as staying drug free (abstinence) are also key to treatment: People with drug overdose may need emergency treatment in the hospital. The exact treatment depends on the drug used. Detoxification (detox) is the withdrawal of the substance abruptly in an environment where there is good support. Detoxification can be done on an inpatient or outpatient basis. At times, another drug with a similar action or effect on the body is taken, as the dose is slowly decreased to reduce the side effects and risks of withdrawal. For example, with narcotic addiction, methadone or similar drugs may be used to prevent withdrawal and continued use. Residential treatment programs monitor and address possible withdrawal symptoms and behaviors. These programs use techniques to get users to recognize their behaviors and learn how not to go back to using (relapse). If the person also has depression or another mental health disorder, it should be treated. In many cases, a person starts using drugs to try to self-treat mental illness. Support Groups Many support groups are available in the community. They include Narcotics Anonymous (NA), Alateen, and Al-Anon. Most of these groups follow the 12-Step program used in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). SMART Recovery and LifeRing are programs that do not use the 12-step approach. You can find other support groups on the internet. Outlook (Prognosis) Substance use may lead to a fatal overdose. Some people start taking thesubstances again (relapse) after they have stopped. Complications of substance use include: Depression Cancer-- for example, mouth and stomach cancer are linked to alcohol abuse and dependence Infection with HIV, or hepatitis B or C through shared needles Loss of job Problems with memory and concentration-- for example with hallucinogen use, including marijuana (THC) Problems with the law Relationship breakup Unsafe sexual practices, which may result in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV, or hepatitis B When to Contact a Medical Professional Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you or a family member is addicted to drugs and would like to get off of them. Also call if you have been cut off from your drug supply and are at risk of withdrawal. Most employers also offer referral services for their employees with substance use problems. Prevention Drug education programs can be helpful. Parents can have a strong influence on their children by teaching them about the harms of using substances. References Kowalchuk A, Reed BC.

Anita Nair's Ladies Coupe: A brilliant evocation of sisterhood on the move,Book review of Anita Nair's 'Ladies Coupe'.,,2012-10-29T12:52:51+05:30,India Today,"By Anita Nair Penguin In the flood of ""Wimmens writing"" that depicts women as battered, bartered and abandoned on the shoals of low self worth, Anita Nairs second novel rides triumphantly against the tide. Second novel? Is it possible? The ink has barely dried on Nairs first one, The Better Man, that trawled with intent through fictions latest heart of darkness, the matrilineal murkdom of Kerala, when shes produced another one. The better woman: A store of revelatory life-affirming tales The better woman: A store of revelatory life-affirming tales Apparently, Nairs imagination teems with stories that leap out like tiny silver fish, struggling to escape a fishermans basket. As though to acknowledge the fact, she has signalled that her book is ""a novel in parts"" and indeed she seems more adept at stringing together a collection of short stories than in going for the long haul. In Ladies Coupe Nair has resorted to one of the oldest ploys. She has taken a leaf out of Chaucers mixed crowd of pilgrims travelling to Canterbury telling tales to each other. He himself, as is well known, borrowed from Boccacio who had his well-heeled cast of characters relating stories to each other while sitting out the plague. Nairs characters too are singularly life affirming. Though they do not confess their life stories publicly to each other while sitting in what used to be a regular feature of rail journeys, the ""ladies compartment"" or coupe of the title, the manner in which she has them sharing their experiences with the protagonist, Akhila or Akhilandeswari, as she becomes towards the end, assuming her full potential as a woman, quite often sounds like a female version of Alcoholics Anonymous. Excerpt Akhila dreams: a train that trundles, truckles and troops into a station. Akhila is seated by a window. Everything but the train is still. The moon hangs at her shoulder and rides with her. She travels through a gallery of nightscapes, each framed by the window. A light in a house. A family huddled around a fire. A howling dog. A distant town. Black oily waters of a river. A menacing hill. A curling road. A railway-crossing with the streetlight glinting on the glasses of a man on a static scooter, hands dangling at his side, heel on the ground, head cocked, watching, waiting for the train to hurtle past. At the station, portraits replace impressions. Reunions. Farewells. A smile. Tears. Anger. Irritation. Anxiety. Boredom. Stillness. Akhila sees them all. The train begins to move. Akhila dreams of being there. And not there. Of adding a memory by the moment. Were the railways providing a hitherto unknown service to the sisterhood of women by throwing them in together for a night and a day of bonding through the boondocks of the Indian countryside? We shall never know. Part of the charm of Nairs narrative is that we are lulled into accepting her thesis. Once locked in together, its a question of age no bar, caste no bar, sex no bar, indeed the intimacy with which the ladies discuss their sexual adventures seems to underline the message that ""having sex"" is destiny. Akhila herself is the magnet for their stories. She has suddenly decided to take her life in her hands. At the age of 45, having achieved near anonymity working as a clerk in the Income Tax Department she is suddenly filled with the idea of revolt. She decides to bolt, to take a long train journey to Kanyakumari. Are there shades of an Anita Brookner heroine here, encased in stiffly starched cotton saris and the disappointments of a lifetime of sacrifice travelling to her own Hotel Sea Breeze by the seafront? Though she might lack the subtlety of a Brookner heroine, Akhila is not without her desires. Theres a hilarious description of her singular form of revolt when she wants to taste a boiled egg brought by an Anglo-Indian colleague to work and, much later, a tense moment when she discovers herself responding to the anonymous groping of a mans hand in a crowded bus. Nairs evocation of the ordinariness of a middle-class Brahmin family struggling to keep itself afloat in Chennai, hanging on to the rigid pattern of their lives, as exemplified in the patterns of kolam traced in front of their houses and expecting an unquestioning sacrifice from the women in the family to underwrite this myth, is what powers her narrative. Akhila and her friends are on the threshold of self-discovery. The manner in which Nair relates these transformations is in turn revelatory and redeeming. Her tale is light enough to relieve the tedium of a long journey and yet filled with the incantatory power to burn up the tracks, to seek a new destination.

Zero Movie Review: Shah Rukh Khan gifts fans mindless Christmas release with Meerut and Mars,"Zero Movie Review: Zero starring Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif has hit the screens today. The film begins well and maintains pace in first half but is a disaster post intermission, says our review.",,2018-12-21T13:45:00+05:30,India Today,"Do not try and find logic in a Salman Khan film. That became a learning long time ago. Leave your brain at home and enjoy the brawn, we told ourselves. Little did we know we would have to make peace with even brainless Shah Rukh Khan films. So when Aanand L Rai named his film Zero, he probably should have got his Maths correct. Because the name of his film might just be the closest metaphor to what Zero is. Bauna Bauua Singh rules Meerut and Mumbai Queen Babita Kumari rules his life. He is 38 years old, vertically challenged and has barely matriculated. Bauua does not want to die a bachelor. So he lands up at a matrimonial agencys doorsteps, a photo of the girl from their portal in hand. But she is out of his league. Or so we think. Scientist Aafiya Yusafzai Bhinder falls in love with this gaanwaar and he serenades her with shooting stars. Till superstar Babita replaces Aafiya in Bauuas life by a stroke of pure, unbelievable luck. Babita Kumari needs a place in Alcoholics Anonymous. But awkwardly waltzes into the baunas heart. Life goes on, from smalltown Meerut to big city Mumbai and before you know it, director Aanand L Rai hurls the next missle at his audience: Mars. Like they say in the best of sci-fi films from the West, a miscalculation of an inch lands a spacecraft several miles off its destination. The trajectory of Zero meets the same fate. Director Aanand L Rais Zero starts well. Shah Rukh Khan plays to the gallery. He dances to Babita Kumaris tunes in the theatre as India dances to his tunes in theatres off screen. Khan romances both Sharma and Kaif with abandon. But he cannot save this disaster of a film. The biggest front on which Zero scores a zero is logic. Writer Himanshu Sharma should have spent some time in researching the nitty-gritties of sending a spaceship to Mars before starting off on this tough journey. Director Aanand L Rai gives Shah Rukh Khan fans enough of the whistle-worthy moments. A lot of slapstick is thrown in to make Zero palatable. That does the trick. Zero gets its seetis and taalis. Shah Rukh rehashes his own elements and adds them to Zero too. There is a lot of romancing; complete with the outstretched arms and teary eyes and quivering lips. Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub as Bauuas best friend is a revelation in Zero. Zeeshan brings his comic timing from Raanjhanaa and gives the audience a best-friend duo to look out for, straight out of our Jai-Veeru tales; complete with the scooter and sidecar. All of these external elements hardly help cover this shoddy tale of mismatched fortunes and love stories. Post intermission, especially in the last 20 minutes of the film, the desperation is visible. The writer and director are both clutching at the last straws and trying to give a befitting end to Zero. They have to try and make sense AND they have to keep Shah Rukh Khan fans happy. In this tussle, logic is thrown into the Pacific Ocean. The film gets passable performances from its lead actors. Shah Rukh Khan is impressive as Bauua Singh. He gets into his a few-sizes-smaller shoes and does the Meerutiya act well. Anushka Sharma does a forgettable Stephen Hawking. Katrina Kaif burns everyone around her... to borrow a line from Shah Rukh Khan, ""She is soooo hot ... that we have to keep her in a tub on the sets."" But beyond her hotness, Katrina Kaif is the usual Katrina Kaif in a Khan film. The music of the film is a winner, with special mention to Husn Parcham and Heer Badnaam. The cameo by Salman Khan and Bollywood actresses from Sridevi to Deepika Padukone are forced into the film to add to its star power. But without legs to stand on, the superficial can do only so much and no more. Zero the film, like its lead character Bauua Singh, falls short. Dont expect Zero to take you to Mars. Meerut, maybe. Zero starring Shah Rukh Khan, Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif has hit the screens today. The film begins well and maintains pace in first half but is a disaster post intermission, says our review. 2 (no, not 0) stars on 5 for Zero. (The writer tweets as @ananya116) Trivia: Anushka Sharma got a wheelchair at home to practise moving around in one for nearly a month.

These consequences may involve Problems at work, school, home or in interpersonal relationships Problems with the law Physical risks that come with using drugs in dangerous situations Alternative Names Substance abuse; Illicit drug abuse; Narcotic abuse; Hallucinogen abuse Information MARIJUANA Marijuana is also called ""grass,"" ""pot,"" ""reefer,"" ""joint,"" ""hashish,"" ""cannabis,"" ""weed,"" and ""Mary Jane."" About 2 in 5 Americans have used marijuana at least once in their life. Marijuana comes from a plant called hemp (Cannabis sativa). The main, active ingredient in marijuana is THC (short for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). This and other ingredients, called cannabinoids, are found in the leaves and flowering parts of the marijuana plant. Hashish is a substance taken from the tops of female marijuana plants. It contains the highest amount of THC. How fast you feel the effects of marijuana depend on how you use it: If you breathe in marijuana smoke (such as from a joint or pipe), you may feel the effects within seconds to several minutes. If you eat foods containing the drug (such as ""hash brownies,"") you may feel the effects within 30 - 60 minutes. Marijuana acts on your central nervous system. Low to moderate amounts of the drug may cause: Increased appetite (""the munchies"") Feeling of joy (euphoria) Relaxed feeling Increased sensations of sight, hearing, and taste Other effects can include: Feelings of panic Anxiety Excessive fear (paranoia) Decreased ability to perform tasks that require coordination (such as driving a car) Decreased interest in completing tasks Delirium Firmly held false beliefs (delusions) Seeing or hearing things that arent there (hallucinations) Bloodshot eyes Increased heart rate and blood pressure Infections such as sinusitis , bronchitis , and asthma in heavy users Irritation of the airways causing narrowing or spasms Possibly weakening of the immune system Sore throat Trouble concentrating and paying attention, which can interfere with learning Trouble telling oneself from others Violence (may be related to marijuana that is laced with a drug called PCP) Regular users may have withdrawal effects when they stop marijuana use. These may include: Agitation Anxiety Insomnia Irritability MEDICAL MARIJUANA The medical use of marijuana is controversial, yet its active ingredient (THC) is legal for medical purposes in at least 16 states. (Whole marijuana is illegal, even for medical use.) THC has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the following medical purposes: Relieving chronic pain and spasticity Stimulating appetite in patients with AIDS or who have undergone chemotherapy Treating glaucoma Treating nausea caused by chemotherapy in cancer patients PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP, ""angel dust"") PCP is an illegal drug that comes as a white powder, which can be dissolved in alcohol or water. PCP may be smoked, shot into a vein, or taken by mouth. How quickly it affects you depends on how you take it. Shooting up: If given through a vein, PCPs effects start within 2-5 minutes. Smoked: The effects begin within 2 - 5 minutes, peaking at 15 - 30 minutes. Taken by mouth: In pill form, or mixed with food or drinks, PCPs effects usually start within 30 minutes. The effects tend to peak in about 2 - 5 hours. Different doses of PCP may cause different effects: Lower doses of PCP typically produce feelings of joy (euphoria) and less inhibition, similar to being drunk. Higher doses can cause numbness throughout the body, and perception changes that may lead to extreme anxiety and violence. Large doses may produce paranoia, ""hearing voices"" (auditory hallucinations), and other forms of psychosis , similar to schizophrenia . , similar to . Massive doses, usually from taking the drug by mouth, may cause kidney failure , heart arrhythmias , muscle rigidity , seizures , and even death. Because of the pain-killing ( analgesic ) properties of PCP, users who get seriously injured may not feel any pain. LSD AND OTHER HALLUCINOGENS LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a strong hallucinogen. Only tiny amounts are needed to cause effects, such as hallucinations. LSD use may cause: Anxiety Blurred vision Dilated pupils Seeing things that arent there ( hallucinations ) ) Paranoia and other delusions Tremors Other commonly abused hallucinogens include: Psilocybin (mushrooms, ""shrooms"") Peyote (a cactus plant containing the active ingredient mescaline) Hallucinogens can lead to extreme anxiety and loss of touch with reality, called ""bad trips"". These experiences can come back as a ""flashback,"" even without using the drug again. Such experiences typically occur during times of increased stress, and tend to occur less often and intensely after stopping the drugs. COCAINE Cocaine is a strong stimulant. The abuse of cocaine increased dramatically in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but is now on the decline. Other names to describe different forms of cocaine include ""crack,"" ""coke,"" ""snow,"" and ""speedball."" Cocaine may be taken in different ways: Snorting: Inhaling it through the nose Shooting up: Dissolving it in water and injecting it into a vein Speedball: Mixing with heroin and injecting into a vein Smoked: Cocaine may be changed into smokeable forms known as freebase or crack Smoking cocaine typically produces a nearly instant and intense sense of joy (euphoria). Other effects include: Feelings of increased confidence and energy Less inhibition Local numbness Regular users of cocaine may need larger amounts of the drug to feel these effects. Regular users of cocaine may develop: Loss of interest in school, work, family, and friends Memory loss Mood swings Sleep problems Social withdrawal Heart disease and other blood vessel disease A hole in the septum that separates the nostrils Heavy use may cause paranoia, which can lead to violence. AMPHETAMINES Amphetamines are stimulants. Other names used to describe amphetamines or methamphetamines include ""crystal,"" ""go,"" ""crank,"" and ""cross-tops."" Amphetamines can be very addictive. Prescription amphetamines are considered controlled substances. Over-the-counter (OTC) amphetamine look-alike drugs are often abused. These drugs typically contain caffeine and other stimulants, and are sold as appetite suppressants or stay-awake/stay-alert aids. Signs and symptoms of stimulant use include: Dilated pupils Exaggerated feeling of well-being (euphoria) Fast heart rate Restlessness and hyperactivity Skin flushing Sleep disturbances Tremors Appetite decrease and weight loss INHALANTS Inhalant use became popular with young teens in the 1960s with ""glue sniffing."" Since then, a greater variety of inhalants have become popular. Inhalant use typically involves younger teens or school-age children. Commonly abused inhalants include: Aerosols for deodorants or hair sprays Cleaning fluids Gasoline Liquid typewriter correction fluid Model glue Spray paints Negative effects of inhalant abuse include: Brain damage Convulsions Liver or kidney damage Nerve damage ( peripheral neuropathy ) Sudden death OPIATES, OPIOIDS, AND NARCOTICS Opiates come from opium poppies. These drugs include morphine and codeine. Opioids are artificial substances that have the same effect as morphine or codeine. The term ""narcotic"" refers to either type of drug. Narcotics are powerful painkillers that cause drowsiness (sedation) and, sometimes, feelings of euphoria. These drugs include: Codeine Heroin Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) Methadone Meperidine (Demerol) Opium Oxycodone (Percocet or Oxycontin) Signs and symptoms of narcotic use include: Sedation Needle marks on the skin (""tracks""), scars or abscesses if drug use is by injection if drug use is by injection Relaxed or euphoric state Small ""pinpoint"" pupils Coma, respiratory depression, and death in high doses Because heroin is commonly injected into a vein (used intravenously), there are health concerns about sharing contaminated needles among IV drug users. Complications of sharing contaminated needles include hepatitis , HIV infection, and AIDS . CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS These substances produce sedating and anxiety-reducing effects, which may be therapeutic in some cases and lead to abuse or dependence in others. These types of drugs include: Alcohol Barbiturates (e.g. amobarbital, pentobarbital, secobarbital), also called ""yellow jackets"" Benzodiazepines (e.g. Valium, Ativan, Xanax) Chloral hydrate Paraldehyde Signs and symptoms of excessive alcohol or other depressant use include: Decreased attention span Impaired judgment Lack of coordination Slurred speech OTHER DRUGS A number of other illegal drugs have become popular and available in recent years, including: Ketamine, a substance related to PCP, commonly called ""Special K"" ""Ecstasy,"" or MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) GHB and Rohypnol, also called ""date rape,"" ""acquaintance rape,"" or ""drug-assisted assault"" drugs CALL YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER If you are concerned about the possibility of getting addicted to any prescribed medications If you are concerned about possible drug abuse by you or a family member If you are interested in getting more information on drug abuse If you are seeking treatment of drug abuse for yourself or a family member SUPPORT GROUPS There are a number of different support groups available to help those with drug abuse.

'I would like to do more work than what I get to do',,,2008-01-19T09:58:17+05:30,India Today,"A well-known face on TV, he’s acted in serials like Hasrateein, Ghar Ek Sapna, Love Story and Thodi Si Zameen, Thoda Sa Aasman. Apart from some regional movies, he has also acted in Bollywood movies like Ramji Londonwale and Corporate. He was last seen in a cameo role in Yash Raj’s Laaga Chunari Mein Daag. Currently shooting for Madhur Bhandarkar’s Fashion where he is playing a gay character, Harsh Chhaya speaks to Shruti Vashist about his journey from being a TV actor to working in films. Q. Tell us about your role in Fashion. A. In the movie, I am playing a gay fashion designer. We just started shooting for the movie this month and it has already been quite an experience for me. While I haven’t changed my lifestyle or the way I look physically, I have to walk, talk and behave in a certain manner which complements my character. This has really been an ‘out-of-body’ experience for me that I have enjoyed doing so far. Harsh Chhaya Harsh Chhaya A. I heard that Madhur Bhandarkar was making this movie. I really liked the concept of it and shot myself with a home video camera for the auditions of the various roles in the movie. I presented it to Bhandarkar and, within a few days, I got a call from him. I was happy to get this particular role because Bollywood rarely offers experimental roles like this. Q. How has the transition from TV to films been? A. Well, I have done TV for many many years now and that can sometimes go against you as an actor. As an accomplished TV actor, I have to face a lot of resistance from the film world. So it is almost like starting from scratch. For whatever reason, I have not been offered too many film roles and would like to do more work. Fashion will help me prove to people that I am a versatile actor and hopefully get me more offers. Q. What’s in the pipeline? A. I will be seen in a comedy called Oh God No God with director Saurabh Srivastav which stars Divya Dutta and Vinay Pathak. Another upcoming venture is Dhuan, which will be directed by Mrinalini Dayal and is based on an issue very relevant today. Q. Your views on anything Gujarati? A. Although I don’t know much about Gujarati cinema, as I have been born and brought up in Delhi, they seem to be too stuck on traditional plots. While my father is from Vadodara, I have relatives in Gujarat in the interiors like Surendranagar and Limbdi. There is stuff about Gujarat which amuses me like the alcoholics anonymous in a totally dry state! Q. Can you read and write Gujarati? A. Yes.

India Fashion Week 2004: Get set for beauty with a twist,"The Lakme India Fashion Week 2004 starts at April 2004. And after the vacuous look of the past, a complex image straddling fantasy and reality will mark the ramp this year.",,2012-03-28T15:27:52+05:30,India Today,"FANTASY FLIGHT: Model Sapna Kumar in a new look created by Manish Arora FANTASY FLIGHT: Model Sapna Kumar in a new look created by Manish Arora The Buzz: Who, What, Why Moni Dutta Moni Dutta Moni Dutta is not on the model list, but is Raghavendra Rathores in-house muse during IFW. The Assamese beauty has just returned from a European stint. India Shining sun tan India Shining sun tan Is fashion getting smarter as designers try to get attention? An ""India Shining"" sun tan bottle is part of Kiran Uttam Ghoshs press kit. First Timers After the discovery of Sabyasachi, new designers are watched closely. Varun Bahls diffusion line, with detailed embellishments, should be well attended for a debut. Despite the noise designers make, there remains a strong suspicion that audiences turn up to watch not the clothes, but those they hang on.The model is the weakest link in the commerce of fashion, yet she is the most visible. Models epitomise what Christian Dior famously called the ""New Look"". They are a reflection of, for what its worth, what ""beauty"" will be in vogue next.Fashion projection has, at different times, glamorised, objectified, celebrated and humiliated women. The supermodel on the international runway was haughty and untouchable.At the peak of the Tom Ford nightclubber days, she wore hideously expensive clothes, but still managed to look dirty. Gianni Versace invented hooker chicon his runway, which was followed by the darker days of John Galliano when women were objects of fetish fantasies. On Indian runways, the couture years saw the rise of the touch-me-not, aloof, exotic supermodel. In the recent pret past, the bad boys of fashion brought her down to earth. Often with a thud. Manish Arora gave her the ""socked eye look"" in the early days of the India Fashion Week (IFW) when in runny overused mascara, she walked down the rampas if she was on her way to Alcoholics Anonymous. So whats the look of the Lakme India Fashion Week, which begins this year on April 27? According to most experts, it is a complicated one. ""The look swings between extremes of reality and extremes of fantasy,"" says stylist Yatin Ahluwalia who, along with partner Jojo, works on the runway look at IFW. Unlike the nude lipstick-wearing, straight-haired, natural, if vacuous Kaif beauty, she is still cheerful, but a lot more cerebral. She is part goddess, part goof. She is mostly happy, but can bite. She is Indian, but could live anywhere. She is a whole package, rather than a part. ""Its a sophisticated cheeriness. The best way to put it would be beauty with a twist,"" says Ahluwalia. Part of it reflects the sartorial adventure that Indian designers are on. While being steeped in Indian craft and textiles in fabric and technique, they are combining many elements in their work. Ashish Soni is influenced by Zen, Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi are inspired by the Sloane Ranger English tweeds, while Morocco seems to be coming up in the works of designers as diverse as Ranna Gill and Ashima-Leena. ""This is a woman who cannot be contained in definitions, she has her own opinions and ideas of style, but unlike the 1980s power dresser of the West, she is much less aggressive and severe in her attitude,"" says Ahluwalia. Dishevelled hair is in, rather than the combed-to-the-scalp neatness of the past year. The mouth is asking for attention, rebelling against the nude tone niceties of the recent past. The eyes are defined once more. While retro chic also returns to international runways- Galliano led the look with his ""grannies from hell"", over-painted models inspired by the 50s, headed for a naughty night out-some insist that good old world glamour fits in just as well in the Indian context. Raghavendra Rathore, a designer more in the classic mould, says, ""As malls mushroom and retail and real estate join hands to create more room for fashion, the industry is riding on their own version of feel-good. Fashion is celebrating sophistication and good old dressing up is nothing to be ashamed of."" His model, he says, will be the classic Indian beauty of the 50s Bollywood, but scratch the surface and there is a raunchy diva just waiting to get out. Runway Tips Ringlets and texturing are big. Throw out the straighteners. Orange, pink and other colours replace nude in lipstick. The eyes are defined again. Blended two-tone colour is hot. Use sheen, gleam and glow. Translucent is back. Arora, with his penchant for the over-the-top, will exaggerate the same theme. The hair will be voluminous enough to house a birds nest, the mouth will be inviting red. This woman enjoys attention. ""There is an aggressive sexiness with a hint of stylishness,"" says Arora.But according to him, it is the subdued nightclub sensibility of Tokyo rather than the sluttiness of New York. ""She is sensual, but mischievous and romantic as well."" Her clothes fit the look: contemporary silhouettes with prints inspired by newborn babies, cartoons and romantic roses.The twist shows up again with fellow shocker Narula. ""She wears chiffon slipdresses with velvet track pants. Her look reflects this contradiction: she is pretty, but not too pretty, she is chic but fun, and she is all these things at the same time."" While Kumar did well as the blank bombshell, designers say she has enough mystery and mischief for the new look.The model who is on top of the heap, charging Rs 18,000 per show, will continue to be a show-opener by all accounts. Insiders say Michelle Innes too can suit the role, as can former Miss India, the now-nice-now moody Poonam Nath.Jesse Randhawas has-she-got-ants-inher-pants excitability might be too strong for the look and last years favourite Bhawna Sharma may be too full of fun to be every mans fantasy. For more, just wait for the frontrow view.",{},"['shining', 'look', 'beauty', '2004', 'india', 'fashion', 'indian', 'designers', 'set', 'fantasy', 'model', 'twist', 'week', 'runway']","India Shining sun tan India Shining sun tanIs fashion getting smarter as designers try to get attention?

Alarming number of youngsters in Indian cities take to drinking,Egged on by peers and condoned by indulgent parents an alarming number of youngsters in Indian cities are taking to the bottle. And chasing their own doom.,,2013-01-04T12:28:58+05:30,India Today,"Every fifth college student in Delhi drinks regularly. About three lakh teenagers cant kick the habit and one lakh need treatment. Every fifth college student in Delhi drinks regularly. About three lakh teenagers cant kick the habit and one lakh need treatment. The parents were influential, the police turned silent and the incident got an official burial. But in Bangalore they still talk about it and with every telling the room turns cold with fear. Five Bangalore boys decide to board a bus bound for Goa. One boy has stolen Rs 1.5 lakh from his parents to fund the trip. One of them gets cold feet and tips off the police. The errant four are found in Hubli, completely drunk. They are all 13 years old. They were going, they say, ""to drink and then die in Goa"". Maybe that isnt chilling enough, so try this then. At 15, Sanjay Kumar was drinking Scotch. His father, a building contractor in Delhi wanted his son to ""live like a king"". This is a short story. At 19, the ""king"" was dead. Inebriated at a new years party he drove his Zen into a pole. The stories are getting gruesome, the evidence is mounting, the message is stark: teenage drinking is spiralling out of control. Drunk children in their shiny new cars with an alcohol-induced disdain for the law are worrying policemen. Since January 1999, when the Chandigarh Police acquired a breath analyser, 226 people have been challaned for drunk driving. Nearly 40 per cent of them were teenagers. Similarly, the Maharashtra Police statistics show that in 1999 there were 244 accidents linked to teenagers who had imbibed a peg too many. Many of the accidents were fatal. Teenagers, with no ID in hand, are streaming into liquor shops to buy their bottle of choice. Daljit Singh of Calcuttas Empire Stores says he gets an average of 60 teenage customers a day. ""They come during the daytime, and buy either canned beer or white drinks like vodka which are easy to conceal."" Youngsters arriving at school with the stale smell of beer on their breath are not completely unknown. In Calcutta the principal of one of the citys posh schools suspended a boy for drinking on the campus. In Delhi, Rajesh Kumar, then 15, drove to school with his friends, all clearly inebriated, and was thrown out. Today, with a history of deviant behaviour like locking his parents out of the house because they refused to give him a Gypsy, he is an alcoholic undergoing counselling. He is only 17. Psychiatrists across the country are alarmed by this sudden spurt in teenage alcoholism. Delhi psychologist Dr Achal Bhagat puts it starkly, ""Alcoholism is becoming a lifestyle for teenagers"". In Chennai, Dr Gopalakrishnan at Chennais Apollo Hospitals says, ""Children are misinterpreting a mug of beer for a fashion fad."" He has six to 10 troubled teenage drinkers visiting him every month. Society in its ambivalence may pass it off as youthful indiscretion but it is far more serious than that. Alcohol routinely destroys brain cells, binge drinking can kill - in Bangalore, 17 youngsters drank all night late last year to find one of their friends dead in his own vomit the next morning - and the liver begins to malfunction. Research by the WHO says that one out of 25 drinkers turns into an alcoholic. Thats a scary statistic considering that alcoholics are 50 to 100 times more prone to commit suicide. As R. Kumar, a counsellor at the Bangalore chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous, confirms, ""We have more and more young people coming to us with drinking problems."" Beyond the health impact is a larger social problem: young drinkers who move from use to abuse find their grades dropping, their interpersonal relationships turning sour and they often resort to deviant behaviour. Says Harsh Vardhan, former health minister of Delhi and currently adviser to WHOs regional director for South-East Asia: ""When teenagers drink they damage their physical and mental growth. They are in fact chasing death."" Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence. Almost half the 3,000 schoolchildren surveyed in Mumbai felt that alcohol was not harmful and that it enhanced self-confidence. The malaise is rooted in the societal acceptance of alcohol and societys indulgent view towards teenagers knocking down the odd peg. Unlike drugs that have an alarming connotation to them, a frothy glass of beer is hardly taboo. If anything, there is a conspicuous absence of deterring messages. The images that waft into living rooms through cable television seem to promote the idea that a swig of beer equals youthful exuberance. Instead of public caution over alcohols harmful effects, the signals are positive. Its hard to convict Shah Rukh Khan for sauntering through a Bagpiper advertisement or Ajay Jadeja for dancing for Kingfisher, but theres no one there to interpret the message for children who go wide-eyed at what their heroes are doing. As psychiatrist Dr Debashish Bhattacharya explains, ""Teenagers have several mistaken notions about drinking: that it is masculine, it enhances the sex drive and that achievers do it."" Hanging around at home with 17-year-old friends and posturing over a whisky bottle, or popping into a bar for an illegal pitcher of beer because its hep, is common conduct among teenagers. For a generation of sensation seekers with an extremely low threshold of boredom, this is terrific pastime. As Shruti, an 18-year-old pub-goer from Chandigarh, says, ""Beer is not an intoxicant. Its a social lubricant."" Alcohol becomes an excuse for everything. If youre too shy to talk to a girl, rum will give you courage; if youre not fitting in with your peers whats a vodka if it means acceptance. Peer pressure as always can be tortuous and as Deepa, a fresher at a Mumbai college puts it, ""If you say no you could be alone for the entire evening and labelled a spoilsport. So whats the big deal in a couple of beers?"" Dilip, a third-year student explains soothingly, ""The next morning the maximum you have is a headache."" If only it was that simple. Sanjay Sahney knows, for he too began with a glass of beer just to be part of the crowd. An engineering student in Mumbai, the metropolis was a different world for this insular Indore boy. No parents to note his movements, a rich girlfriend who enjoyed frequenting the citys hot spots, life was that cliched ""big party"", he says. Except that one glass of beer grew to a bottle, one bottle grew to four a day. ""I used to crave for the high because it left me happy."" Except that his grades slipped and he fell into debt, till a student counsellor sent him to Seva Dan, an NGO that works with alcohol and drug abusers. Today, eight months later, Sahney is limping back to normalcy. In the heat of the moment, young men are too busy to realise that the confidence a bellyful of beer brings is entirely false and often dangerous. They strut out of bars ready to do Michael Schumacher impersonations on city roads only to wind up sober in the morgue. Similarly, a brain addled by too many whiskies emboldens shy young men and leads them into risky sexual behaviour. ""They consume alcohol to get the confidence ... and then they visit prostitutes,"" says Sekhar Sheshadri, additional professor of psychiatry, NIMHANS. A scary corollary to this is another NIMHANS study which reveals that 70 per cent of HIV patients are alcoholics, especially teenagers. The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age. The best way to control the problem is to make it more difficult for youngsters to find a drink. Liquor shops must insist on proof of age. As alcohol abuse grows it becomes a significant crutch and much like Asterix, young people believe that one sip of this magic potion is all it takes. A survey of 3,000 class 10 students by Seva Dan in 13 schools in Mumbai revealed some frightening figures. Forty-eight per cent of the children didnt think that alcohol was harmful, 47 per cent said it helped gain confidence and 52 per cent said it helped decrease mental tension. If parents are slow to recognise their child is stressed, they take a mild view if their children toss back a few even if they havent reached the legal age. As Panjab University sociologist Rajesh Gill says, ""Its no longer stigmatised."" The comments are not out of place. A fortnight ago, Sanjeev Verma, owner of Wild West, one of Chandigarhs oldest pubs, was told by a father that he wanted beer served at his sons school passing-out party. A manager of a bowling company in Mumbai concurs: ""We have the right to refuse but if a parent asks for a pitcher of beer and pours his teenage son a glassful we are helpless."" Not all parents grant their children a drinking license. Yet when both parents work and attempt to compensate for their absence by doling out large sums of pocket money, it can be a dangerous indulgence. It is a situation that is compounded by the easy availability of alcohol, says Vimla Nadkarni, professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai. Unlike most western countries where only the flash of a required ID is a passport to a drink, laws in India are loosely enforced. Eighteen may be the legal age to ask for a beer but one round of the pubs in any city confirms that few bartenders have ever heard of it. And there are certainly no shortage of pubs. Six years ago, Chandigarh, a city of white beards, had just two pubs; today there are 26. Excise Department rules also stipulate that a liquor outlet must not come up within 100 m of an educational institution or religious place, but it is a rule easily flouted. Governments see no sin in being casual, blinded as they may be by profits. In Maharashtra, the excise income from sales of beer, IMFL, and wine in 1997-98 was Rs 774.79 crore; in 1998-99 it is expected to be Rs 1,023.23 crore. Naturally, teenage alcoholism is also on the rise. According to studies done by the De-Addiction Centre at AIIMS in Delhi, every fifth teenager in the 15-19 age group in the capital drinks regularly and around three lakh are addicted. Another one lakh, it is estimated, need medical attention for alcohol-related disorders. Says H.K. Sharma, a social scientist who was associated with the studies: ""Any party or get-together is incomplete without corks popping open. Its a whirlpool into which children get sucked so easily."" To alter established mind-sets, to convince a generation that the buzz that comes with a beer has dangerous implications, requires a mammoth effort. Counsellors stress that parents must start communicating with their children, identify reasons for their stress and not turn away with a grin when junior steals a peg of whisky from daddys cabinet. In fact, some Mumbai colleges have already put up posters that read, ""Drinking with Dad is also Bad"". The most basic of all prevention is enforcing the ban on sale to those under 18. The harder it is for kids to find a drink the better it is. As Y.G. Rajalakshmi Parthasarathy, dean of the Chennais Padma Seshadri group of schools insists: ""Age certificates have to be made a must."" Chennai Police say they conduct surprise raids in front of schools on Saturday nights when teenagers are prone to drink and drive, but its not enough. Also, a society that merely smirks at underage kids trying to find some machismo in a beer mug needs to understand theres nothing amusing in it. The journey from recreation to addiction, or to death in a Zen at 19, is not a long one. -with Sayantan Chakravarty, Avirook Sen, Ramesh Vinayak, Stephen David and Methil Renuka",{},"['drinking', 'children', 'cities', 'alarming', 'alcohol', 'mumbai', 'indian', 'parents', 'beer', 'teenagers', 'delhi', 'youngsters', 'number', 'drink', 'lakh']","About three lakh teenagers can't kick the habit and one lakh need treatment.

LETTERS,,,1993-09-15T00:00:00+05:30,India Today,"A PYRRHIC VICTORY I am anguished by the immorality of means and the crude tactics adopted by the Rao Government to defeat the no-confidence motion sponsored by the combined opposition (""A Battered PM"", August 15). Never in the past had a government at the Centre stooped to ignoble means like using money and indulging in horse-trading to remain in power. While the Congress(I) has only served to further erode morality in public life, the moral authority of the Government to rule the country has been undermined. Hyderabad s.b. singh The role played by Mulayam Singh Yadav in the survival of the Congress(I) Government cannot be easily dismissed. He nurtures dreams of becoming chief minister of Uttar Pradesh by riding on Narasimha Raos shoulders. But are these weak shoulders capable of carrying him? Dehra Dun shailendra seinger RAO IS IRREPLACEABLE The opinion poll ( Three Way Split"", August 15) reveals two very interesting aspects of the public mood. They are: the emerging consensus on the Ram Mandir and Raos lead in comparison to other prime ministerial hopefuls. Isnt it ironical that Rao still commands confidence in spite of the scandals besieging him? This only highlights the sad fact that there is an absolute lack of credible leaders in the country. Pune vijayan b. Your electoral prediction does not take into account political parties other than the main three-Congress(I), bjp. National Front-Left Front combine. The smaller, regional parties play a crucial role in determining the result in a general election. Madras c.t. vairavan The opinion poll only highlights how short public memory is and the ease with which politicians manipulate the minds of the people. This is reflected in the way political equations have undergone a complete change within a short span of six months. But the sad part is that we Indians are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even if there is a mid-term poll, there isnt much to choose from. Indore ananth srinivas Your story based on the marg poll seems to have been cooked up within the four walls of your office. If you think there is no bjp wave, all you need to do is hold a mid-term poll to find out the truth. The way the bjp has grown in the past few years is only because of the personality of L.K. Advani. I do not believe that he comes fourth in the race for prime minister. Next time you publish a so-called opinion poll, make sure that you present it in such a way that it does not look or sound so made-up. New Delhi asha prabha CRIMINAL FARCE This is a case of grotesque juxtaposition (""Gunning for Cover"", August 15). Men who are facing criminal charges are being protected by the state while it is society which needs protection from them. And the very same state is, on the other hand, fighting these men in the courts. Bhopal KHALII) AL HASAN THE TIME CRUNCH It is hard to believe that bereft of its Air Time Committee (atc), Doordarshan was unable to evolve reasonable criteria for allotting time slots on its satellite channels (""Air Time Inanities"", August 15). If that was really the case, one is hard put to explain dds success on its two channels. Besides, it will be grossly underestimating the Indian bureaucracys sophistication to blame it on plain incompetence. The real reason perhaps was the time crunch. Hyderabad Dr codadu pratap STILL SMOKY One cant be certain even now whether the cbi will be able, or allowed, to produce clinching evidence linking Rajiv Gandhi with the Bofors pay-off (""The Smoke Clears August 15). But it doesnt really matter. Anyone who believes that the late prime minister was not one of the beneficiaries must be naive or a fool. Or Mani Shankar Aiyar. Bangalore k.r. narayanaswamy LET REASON REIGN Your story on the rationalist movement (""The Triumph of Reason"", August 15) was refreshing. People need to emerge from the shadows of astrology and superstition. They need to discover that success depends on the work of their hands and not on the lines on their palms. On the other hand, it is necessary to realise that science too is not infallible. When I was at school we were taught that neutrons were the smallest particles. Now we have discovered neutrinos and quarks. Kanpur chhotechai BIG BUSYBODY By forcing Russia to backtrack on its deal with India to supply cryogenic rocket technology (""Misguided Muscle"", August 15), Uncle Sam has clearly proved that in addition to its many faults, it is also the biggest busybody in the world. By his abject surrender to US blackmail, Boris Yeltsin has damaged his own stature and credibility. Im certain the Russian President would even roll over and play dead if his American masters asked him to. New Delhi samir mahajan The US has once again established its credentials as a world policeman by forcing Russia to break its agreement with India. Obviously the US is concerned about our success in space technology and wants to protect its own multimillion-dollar arms market. The Government must provide adequate funds, necessary facilities and moral support to our technocrats and scientists to undertake a space research programme to devise an indigenous substitute for the cryogenic engine technology. Solan PRAMOD SHARMA CLEANING THE CAPITAL The most important thing is to control the menace of air pollution (""Capital Punishment"", August 15). The main culprit is the ever increasing number of vehicles on the road. It is, therefore, imperative that air pollution control leg- islation be strictly implemented immediately. The authorities should be equipped with modern gadgets to check the levels of emission and must be empowered to file cases against the defaulters. Above all, the courts should decide cases promptly in order to deter offenders. New Delhi k.k. bajaj The problems of Delhi, so professionally summed up by you, are really well known. What is lacking is any long-term plan to tackle them with sincerity and determination. The greatest need at the moment is to set up an efficient transport system by implementing the Metropolitan Rapid Transport System through public and private funding. A few zones in the city could be declared out of bounds for private vehicles. Pedestrian plazas will cut down traffic snarls in the congested areas. If none of these plans work and things continue to deteriorate, we could shift the capital elsewhere and hope that history does not repeat itself. Bangalore d.b.n. murthy In a typically Indian way we will all complain about our suffering, vehemently discuss Delhis problems till we tire ourselves and then continue life as before. Nobody will take the initiative and take the necessary decisions. Ideas and proposals will be written down and then be lost in the bureaucratic jungle. New Delhi thomas and nancy niggli STRESS ON QUANTITY Your special survey on housing (""Building on Shortages"", August 15) was enlightening and relevant. However, you have not stressed the necessity of building large-scale low-cost housing. For most people interested in just finding a roof over their heads, fancy flats and bungalows are out of reach. There must be emphasis on the construction of inexpensive dwellings and importance should be given to utility and comfort rather than merely style and decor. Panchkula, Haryana alokgupta DENIGRATING OURSELVES Your tribute to A.K. Ramanujan (""Without Obituary"", August 15) cites the MacArthur prize as ""the highest critical accolade in the US"", while the Sahitya Akademi is called ""puny"". The former, established by an insurance tycoon, is nothing more than a monetary award given to dozens every year-well known and obscure, accomplished and potentially outstanding-merely to relieve them of the need to chase money. Do we still need to drool over any little recognition abroad while denigrating our own institutions? Madras s. ashok MIRACULOUS MATA The sarcasm and tone of your story on Mata Amritanandamayi, is intolerable (""The Gurus For the 90s"". July 31). My wife and I were deemed by doctors to be infertile but we were blessed with a child only by her divine grace and love. Ammas children shed tears of joy and relief lying in her lap. We offer these tears to our Mata. What qualification, what spiritual authority do you possess to write about one who is the divine mother of the universe? Madras t.n. krishnachandran Mata Amritanandamayi, who you have written so harshly about, is the ambrosia that saved my husbands life and restored our domestic harmony. He was an alcoholic and smoking for over a decade. Then, just one confession to the Mata brought about a transformation which neither the Alcoholics Anonymous nor a clinical psychologist was able to bring about. I will be eternally grateful to her. Madras vinaya govindam A QUESTION OF TRUST Lt-General A.S. Bhullar, director-general, Bureau of Indian Standards (bis), is right in saying in his letter that the bis is the first organisation to issue quality system certificates. But Indian Register Quality Systems (irqs), a department of Indian Register of Shipping, is the first duly accredited Indian organisation for certification of quality systems (""Certified Fit"", Trade Winds, May 31). The certification system of the bis has not been independently verified as meeting internationally accepted criteria for certification bodies, unlike irqs which has been accredited by Raad voor de Certifi-catie of the Netherlands. Consequently, the bis certificate may not be easily accepted by importers abroad. This is not to say that the bis system is inferior. What is urgently needed is a national accreditation system and organisation-like the UKs National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies- as recommended by the EC experts group.

Ramesh Tawadkar claimed he was misquoted even as Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar did some damage control to say homosexuality is not a ""disease"". ""I was misunderstood and misquoted. I was not talking about the LGBT (youths) but about drug addicted and sexually abused youths,"" Tawadkar told PTI, as local channels in Goa continued to air the footage in which he assured medical treatment to LGBT youths to make them ""normal"". ""Youth policy speaks about drug addicted youths and sexually abused youths as a focused group. There are provisions in the central government sponsored Social Justice Scheme for such youths which can be implemented in Goa,"" the Sports and Youth Affairs minister said, a day after he was widely criticised for his statements. He said when journalists asked him about LGBTs(Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders), he told them, ""I am not expert on the issue."" The minister also refused to acknowledge LGBT as a focused group, though the youth policy document which is currently in public domain has mentioned them as one. ""We will make them normal. We will have a centre for them. Like Alcoholic Anonymous centres, we will have centres. We will train them and give them medicines too,"" the minister had said. ""Like in the case of other target groups such as juvenile offenders, drug afflicted youth, marginalised or migrant youth, geographically disadvantaged youth, a detailed survey would be carried out among state LGBT community, so that their problems could be specifically addressed,"" he had added. In a damage control exercise, Parsekar said, ""Homosexuality is a natural thing, it is not a disease...It could be ignorance. Probably, he might have thought of some other question and reacted."" Asked what was the state governments stand on homosexuality, he said, ""it is a natural thing"". The row broke out even as visiting UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon strongly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality in India, saying that doing so breeds intolerance by violating basic rights to privacy and freedom. Reacting to Tawadkars remarks, noted fashion designer Wendell Rodricks said the minister was trying to divert attention from the main issues by talking such things. ""There are lot of other issues which need urgent attention in Goa. They should concentrate on real issues like corruption, illegal constructions, drug mafia, lawlessness and others,"" said Wendell. Wendell also took to Twitter to lodge his protest over and said, ""They seem #lost in the #Goa mist. Talk about quick backtrack on the #LGBT #treatment #centres in Goa.

""The idea had been brewing in my mind for a long time. I was offered a game show by Star television, which I refused. When I suggested Satyamev Jayate, the television network agreed.

Admitting that he never anticipated such an overwhelming response to the show, Khan aid that the aim of the latest episode which focused on sports was to exhort children to dump their video games and go out in the open. ""It is so disturbing that they have forgotten how to play under harsh elements. Outdoor sports are also about socialising and realising the importance of team play. Besides, look at the violence in digital games. Its so sad to see the younger generation getting addicted to them. Schools are also to be blamed.

(Representational Image) A three-year-old girl was rescued by Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) in Delhis Prem Nagar. The minor was found lying in a pool of excreta in her room. She was severely ill. She looked pale and her alcoholic father was asleep next to her. The DCW rescued the minor after receiving an anonymous complaint that a minor girl in Prem Nagar area was not fed for the last three days by her father. The DCW team found her father sleeping in the same room which was filled with empty liquor bottles. When they tried to wake him up, he got violent. The DCW team then called the police and took the duo -- the father and child -- to the Prem Nagar police station. However, no FIR has been registered so far in the matter. The neighbors informed DCW that the father, a rickshaw puller, was a drunkard and would not wake up for hours while his daughter wept due to hunger and the filth inside the room. The childs mother died a year ago and the father was drunk all the time, the neighbours told the DCW team. He would leave the girl alone in the room whenever he went to work and did not allow his neighbours to help him.

Haryana government admits to possibility of mass rapes in Murthal,The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday castigated the Haryana Police for suppressing the facts pertaining to the alleged Murthal mass rapes.,,2016-04-12T08:33:13+05:30,India Today,"Around 20 women claimed to have been raped by agitators. At least 30 people were killed and over 300 injured in the nine-day-long Jat agitation in Haryana. The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday castigated the Haryana Police for suppressing the facts pertaining to the alleged Murthal mass rapes. In another development the state government - which earlier denied that no rapes were reported during the Jat agitation - admitted to the possibility of rapes during the hearing. The Haryana government was further embarrassed when the police, which had also earlier denied that no rapes took place during the nine-day Jat agitation, told the court that they were investigating two complaints filed by alleged rape victims. Submitting the SIT report in the form of an affidavit, Murthal gangrape SIT chief IG Mamta Singh informed the court that the police have included Section 376-D (rape) of the Indian Penal Code to FIR No 118 registered on March 30, 2016. Belongings of alleged rape victims were found on streets Belongings of alleged rape victims were found on streets The section has been included on the basis of complaint of Delhi resident that women were allegedly sexually assaulted by the agitators. The state government said it had received anonymous letters alleging that the rapes took place. ""The anonymous letter forwarded by CP Faridabad vide letter dated March 1, 2016 to SP Sonipat which was further forwarded to Special Group of officers by SP Sonipat on March 2 and the letter from a non-resident Indian forwarded by a news channel on March 2016 was also taken on record. Since the content of both communications reveals commission of offence under Section 376 of the IPC, the relevant Section has been added on the basis of the content and further investigation will be conducted on these communications to verify the content of communication,"" the affidavit submitted by Haryana police said. ""Efforts have been made to identify the victim of these two communications. Keeping in view the sensitivity of the matter, utmost care has been taken to keep secret the identity of the victim, if the communication is substantiated, and victim is identified,"" the affidavit added. So far, three alleged rape victims have surfaced. One of the victims is a final year degree student, who was present on the street along with her father. The second woman who has alleged rape is a resident of Patparganj in New Delhi. She has spoken to amicus curiae Anupam Gupta. The third alleged victim is an Australian woman whose complaint was also forwarded to the police. The court also questioned the state government on the appointment of the Parkash Singh Committee to look into the incidents of violence during the Jat agitation, asking it to clarify its constitutional and legal status. ""We have been taken for enough rides. We wont be taken for one more. The police only registered FIR after we pulled them. After the court pulled them up, the police have now conditionally accepted the rapes. I have video tapes of Murthal victims statement,"" Gupta said. Meanwhile, a Chandigarhbased NGO, Haryana Human Rights has said it will file a contempt petition against former SIT chief Dr Rajshree as she misled the court and the media.

'Drunchies' behind youth obesity epidemic,,,2018-08-08T13:06:00+05:30,India Today,"Washington, Aug 8 (PTI) Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say. Researchers from University at Buffalo in the US decided to look at a sample of 286 college students to better understand how drinking affects what they eat, both that night and for their first meal the next day when, most likely, they are hungover. ""Given the obesity epidemic and the rates of alcohol consumption on college campuses, we need to be aware of not only the negative effect of alcohol consumption, but also the impact it has on what people are eating while they are drinking,"" said Jessica Kruger, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo. Research on the effects of drinking and diet is scarce, Kruger said, adding that eating more unhealthy foods following alcohol consumption is an often overlooked behaviour in traditional addiction research. The inspiration for the study, published in the Californian Journal of Health Promotion, came from an ad researchers saw in a university newspaper. ""It said, Got Drunchies? and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said. An average beer contains 150 calories. If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. Add two slices of pizza or a burrito to that at the end of the night, and its a recipe for weight gain, she said. ""So, we dug a bit deeper and first figured out what the drunchies were, and then decided this would be interesting to study,"" Kruger said. Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous online survey. Researchers found that drinking influenced study participants dietary behaviours before going to bed. All alcohol drinkers were more likely to eat something before they went to bed after drinking alcohol than in general before they go to bed. Specifically, they were more likely to opt for salty snack foods and pizza. Healthy foods, such as dark green vegetables and other veggies they would ordinarily eat, were not as appealing. Of particular concern, the researchers noted, was the fact that participants did not report drinking more water or other non-alcoholic beverages before bed. That exacerbates dehydration, which may lead to additionally unhealthy food choices. The following day after drinking, participants dietary patterns varied from the night before. They were less likely to skip meals the morning after a night of drinking compared to a typical morning. They favoured foods like pizza or tacos over milk and dairy products and grains, most likely because of the so-called hangover cures that get passed down to students and which entail eating foods that ""soak up"" the alcohol. Dispelling these myths is one way to promote a healthy diet even after a night of binge drinking, Kruger said.

"Orissa village women forge their identity, future with micro credit schemes, determination",Women in some of Orissa's most impoverished villages are forging their identity and their future with the state's micro credit schemes and their determination.,,2012-08-23T18:48:30+05:30,India Today,"TIES OF PROFIT: Women in Atotapalli village have taken a loan to start a community brick kiln; others (below right) in Mayurbhanj district earn their living at a rope-making unit TIES OF PROFIT: Women in Atotapalli village have taken a loan to start a community brick kiln; others (below right) in Mayurbhanj district earn their living at a rope-making unit WOMEN AT WORK: Confident participants at a district Sanchayika Sangh meeting WOMEN AT WORK: Confident participants at a district Sanchayika Sangh meeting Some miracles are self-made. Stranded deep in Orissas backwoods, Tapaswini Dhals life was a bleak one and there was little hope of her seeing light in the years to come. With no electricity, her thatched home in Mayurbhanj descended into darkness every night and her husbands meagre earnings meant that her four children went hungry most of the time.Till the day she heard of womens self-help groups in the state and decided to join. Soon after, Dhal was able to set up a small rope-making unit. Over the months, the common fund to which she subscribed along with other women grew big enough for her to apply for a loan. The amount she wanted wasnt huge but it was sufficient for her to pay for a power connection at home. ""We havent become rich,"" says Dhal. ""But the future looks brighter now.""Like Dhal, there are many other women leading anonymous lives in the remote regions of Orissa who are now daring to dream. Individually helpless, they have found strength in numbers by joining the self-help groups being set up under Mission Shakti, a statewide campaign launched last year by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.The object of Mission Shakti is to facilitate the empowerment of women. ""It is as if a silent revolution is on,"" says Anu Garg of the state Governments Social Welfare Department, who heads the mission.Garg should know best. Her phones ring constantly with officials at ground zero reporting heartening stories: a self-help group in Odapada of Dhenkanal pooled in money to get an orphan girl married, in Khurda a group of women overpowered a suspected rapist who had managed to give the police the slip, in Chatrapur crooked contractors found themselves laid off as women took to laying roads, in Koraput, alcoholic husbands had been served ultimatums, and so the stories grow.Although a full-fledged campaign to form self-groups began only last year, the idea is not entirely new. Years ago in a unique experiment, an innovative district collector at Ganjam, Santosh Satpathy, encouraged women in his district to save money. The women were initially reluctant because few realised the value of savings.But with constant prodding, Satpathy managed to build a common pool, even accommodating women who could spare only Re 1 a day. Thus began a movement. As the groups grew in size and number, the kitty too grew fatter. By the last count, there were over 8,000 groups in Ganjam with over one lakh members who could boast of a total savings of around Rs 5 crore.Soon women began setting up their own businesses, such as brick kilns and units collecting and processing forest products. Some borrowed from the kitty while others approached banks for loans. With savings becoming a habit, loan defaults were a rarity and the size of the common fund remained healthy. The women discovered a new side to themselves. ""They were able to get back their voices,"" says Sanjeev Mishra, the current collector of Ganjam.Tales of the Ganjam womens success soon travelled to the neighbouring districts. The women of Atotapalli in Chatrapur too organised themselves into a group and set up a brick kiln. As profits trickled in, they began calling the shots. They recall how they stopped one of their husbands from going in for a second marriage. They even roped in the police to teach the man a lesson.Impressed by the developments in Ganjam and Chatrapur, Patnaik decided to give the self-help programmes an official boost. To make matters easier, Satpathy was now serving in the chief ministers secretariat itself. Using Satpathys expertise, Patnaik soon kicked off Mission Shakti.Unlike states like Tamil Nadu where the Government spends around Rs 200 crore a year on similar self-help groups, the Orissa Government only helps build up credit linkages of the groups with the banks. The banks are only too willing to lend. ""With defaults as little as 2 per cent, our money is safe,"" explains Prasanna Kumar Behera of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.While women in Orissa have unarguably benefited from the programme, there have been gains for local politicians too. It was just as well for the chief minister that his assembly constituency was in Ganjam district. The scheme can only have widened his support base.By focusing on the formation of one lakh self-help groups, he has ensured the rock-solid backing of two million women in the state. ""The issue is not about reaping political dividends,"" insists Dharmendra Pradhan, a BJP MLA. ""It is about improving lives and empowering women."" Whatever the political motivation behind the scheme, the statewide campaign is bringing about unprecedented synergy among the women.In the one year that Mission Shakti has been at work, at least 29,000 additional self-help groups have sprung up over the state, from Nayagarh in coastal Orissa to Nowrangpur and Koraput districts deep in the tribal interiors. Whats more, the women in these groups have managed to save Rs 6 crore so far, a fund from which they freely borrow and just as easily replenish.Rita Roy, a sociologist with the Bhubaneswar-based Utkal University, says Orissas women are finally beginning to forge an identity of their own. Its true in more ways than one. For years, the women of Panijia were little more than voiceless entities. But ever since they grouped themselves into the Bana Durga Sayang Sanchayaka Sangh-the groups are generally named after reigning deities-the men ""comply with what we say"", smiles Rukmini Deo, one of the regions pioneer women.Although illiterate, Deo and other sangh members were clear that their children should be educated. So they went about planning a school in the village. While they provided the money for the structure, their men agreed to put it up free of cost. The school building at the centre of the village is a veritable landmark now. It not only stands as a tribute to the efforts of the women, but also holds the promise of a secure future for their children.Its a heartening example for other women so far trapped in poverty and illiteracy, unable to rise out of it or dream of a better future for their children. With their rope units and brick kilns, these women are building the road to hope in Orissa.",{},"['village', 'women', 'determination', 'orissa', 'forge', 'state', 'identity', 'groups', 'district', 'ganjam', 'money', 'micro', 'brick', 'selfhelp', 'schemes', 'future', 'credit']","The amount she wanted wasn't huge but it was sufficient for her to pay for a power connection at home.

Contusion in Command,,,1993-04-15T00:00:00+05:30,India Today,"AN alarming chain of events that unfolded last month has caused considerable embarrassment and convulsions in the higher command levels of the army. Top level courts of inquiry have opened up a Pandoras box, involving misuse of funds and command failure in the sensitive Eastern Command that plays a strategic role in defending the border against China and in containing insurgency in the North-east. Key professional reputations have been tarnished. The services of a Lt General, N.P.S. Bal, have been terminated. Two major-generals and several officers face inquiries. One brigadier has been dismissed from service and two others face trial. The details have been pieced together by india today with access to reports of courts of inquiry and high-level official correspondence. The disturbing story began soon after Major-General Vinod Saighal, an armoured corps officer and former military attache to France, took over command of27 Mountain Division on March 17,1991. Differences arose with Lt General Bal, then goc of 33 Corps, a Param Vishisht Seva Medal recipient with considerable combat experience. Bals career had a brush with controversy in 1984 when he was accused of being soft towards Sikh army deserters. He was later exonerated. Within 17 days of taking over, Saighal sent a signal to HQ 33 Corps expressing reservations about the ""strategies for the 90s and proposed redeployment and dual tasking of formations"". The plan called for thinning out the army in the Himalayas in view of the receding threat from China. To Bals chagrin, Saighal sent a copy of his dissenting note to the Command HQ in Calcutta. Bal asked him not to bypass the Corps HQ. Saighal ignored this: ""The national interest requires that those directly charged with preserving the sanctity of the countrys frontiers communicate their misgivings to their military superiors."" Finally, Lt General K.S. Brar, then coc-in-c, Eastern Command, had to warn Saighal: ""Ive found in you a consistent tendency to question orders..in an effort to project yourself as an independent thinker."" The strategy was nonetheless implemented. Differences between Saighal and Bal surfaced again when Major Rajiv Khanduri, posted in HQ 27 Mountain Division, died from gunshot injuries in mysterious circumstances on May 25, 1991. An inquiry ruled out foul play. But Saighal was not satisfied. He appointed an evaluation committee which recommended a cbi inquiry. Saighal wrote to the Army HQ, alleging foul play and referred to rumours about an alleged extra-marital affair involving a senior officer. But Bal and Brar decided to go by the inquiry report. Saighal was again reprimanded for overstepping himself. From then on, it was an undeclared war between Saighal and Bal. One instance was the inquiry into the canteen of HQ 123 Mountain Brigade, commanded by Brigadier G.S. Kahlon. Saighal alleged that Kahlon had been provided immunity by his predecessor, Major-General Kulwant Singh, and Bal. But Bal maintained that Saighal was blowing the whole thing out of proportion. As the top commanders locked horns, several other units of 27 Mountain Divi- sion got into trouble. According to inquiries, an engineers regiment was alleged to have misappropriated operational funds; a battalion of the Bihar Regiment (2 Bihar) was accused of selling coal dust illegally; and a battalion of the Garhwal Rifles (19 Garhwal) was allegedly running an unauthorised soda water factory. Allegations surfaced against the ordnance unit of the division and the ordnance set-up in HQ 33 Corps. Meanwhile, there was a dispute between Saighal and Bal over an adverse evaluation given by Saighal to Brigadier M.P.S. Kondal, commander, 166 Mountain Brigade. Instead of accepting Saighals dim view of his brigadier, Bal decided to organise an exercise in October 1991 to test Kondals proficiency. Saighal complained that Bal was interfering in his command. But Bal maintained that he chose to test Kondal personally to ensure that he was not being treated unfairly. The shenanigans continued. A battalion of the Sikh Regiment (19 Sikh)-a part of 2 7 Mountain Division-became the centre of controversy when two of its officers were roughed up by jawans. Bal ordered another officer, an alcoholic, to be hospitalised and had the commandant replaced. Saighal complained against Bals interference. But Bals response was: since Saighal never visited the unit, he, as the regiments ceremonial colonel-commandant had to ensure things did not get out of hand. THE constant skirmishes were bound to escalate into a full-blown battle and the involvement of the Army HQ and Defence Ministry was inevitable. Saighal wrote several letters to the ministry. One contained insinuations of a ""communal nexus"" between various senior officers in the Command, others spoke of the presence of anti-national elements in the Corps. Some of the communications were anonymous. That led to the Military Secretarys branch at Army HQ scrutinising the annual confidential reports initiated by the concerned officers. In an unusual move, the Army HQ appointed a court of inquiry in October 1991 headed by the then vice-chief of army staff, Lt General V.K. Sood. Eventually, Bal was removed from the command of 33 Corps and appointed director-general, Rashtriya Rifles, at New Delhi. Saighal too was removed and appointed deputy commandant, College of Combat, Mhow. Sood is reported to have expressed dismay at the state of affairs in 33 Corps. Following this, Kulwant Singh was removed from a pivotal appointment in the HQ Western Command and posted as deputy commandant, Infantry School, Belgaum. He was issued a show cause notice for the award of the army chiefs displeasure, and action is yet to be taken. But that was not the end of the story. The sorry saga, in fact, took a strange twist. Saighal, the cause of much of the controversy, suddenly saw a change in his professional fortunes. He was given command of 24 Rapid Division in the Western Sector, a more sensitive command than his earlier command of the Mountain Division. His rehabilitation is still steeped in mystery and is viewed by many officers of the Eastern Command as being another example of the imbalance and inconsistency in decisions taken by the Defence Ministry. However, Army HQ sources said Saighal was given a second command in view of his representation against the adverse report filed against him. The unusual turnaround in Saighals case is more surprising considering the action taken against others. On the basis of separate inquiries, several other officers are to face court martial. Kahlon has been sentenced to dismissal. Eight officers of 123 Mountain Brigade are facing action. And the 33 Corps deputy director of ordnance, a brigadier, who has since retired, continues to be attached for court martial proceedings. Bal, meanwhile, was given a show cause notice last October on the basis of Soods inquiry, for award of severe displeasure of the army chief on four counts. The charges included misuse of manpower and army transport, failing to report property returns satisfactorily, failing to accommodate views different from his own, interference in the command of subordinates and exhibiting lack of firmness in dealing with Saighal. But then, instead of inviting the army chief s displeasure, Bal was dismissed by the Government on January 25 under Section 18 of the Army Act, 1950, and his decorations withdrawn. ""The termination of Bals services in this manner was not only unprecedented but came as a great shock to me,"" said Brar, adding that while Saighals conduct was unbecoming of an officer, he had no complaints against Bal. Regretting that the action against Bal and the rehabilitation of Saighal were done within days of his retirement on October 1,1992 as goc-in-c, Eastern Command, Brar observed: ""What value is an army commander if his views are to be undermined."" Sood is unwilling to talk: ""I completed the inquiry in November 1991 and retired in February 1992. The action against Bal may be related to something that happened after that."" Full details of the episode may never be known. But it raises many disturbing questions about key areas of the armys functioning. Ego clashes and disagreements are nothing new among senior officers in professional armies. But the way these undermined the Eastern Command and the fact that charges and countercharges of incompetence and even a communal nexus were allowed to be tossed around as if it were routine bureaucratic warfare in a government department, is extremely disturbing. While refusing to comment on the episode, the Army HQ says steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence. But judging by the curious twists and turns in the recent happenings in the crucial Eastern Command, that is unlikely to be taken seriously by the officers whose careers depend on the whims of the military bureaucracy.",{},"['contusion', 'army', 'saighal', 'officers', 'bal', 'hq', 'corps', 'eastern', 'command', 'mountain', 'inquiry']","Top level courts of inquiry have opened up a Pandora's box, involving misuse of funds and command failure in the sensitive Eastern Command that plays a strategic role in defending the border against China and in containing insurgency in the North-east.
To Bal's chagrin, Saighal sent a copy of his dissenting note to the Command HQ in Calcutta.
Brar, then coc-in-c, Eastern Command, had to warn Saighal: ""I've found in you a consistent tendency to question orders..in an effort to project yourself as an 'independent thinker'.""
He was given command of 24 Rapid Division in the Western Sector, a more sensitive command than his earlier command of the Mountain Division.

Sweeping social changes and new role models give dramatic rise in teenage crime,"With more and more teenagers from well-to-do families turning to crime, tremors of shock are rippling through Indian society.",,2013-08-30T17:47:29+05:30,India Today,"Four rich schoolboys killed an executive for money as they wanted to go on a holiday Four rich schoolboys killed an executive for money as they wanted to go on a holiday Kokila Vora had barely opened the door of her Bombay flat to let in her son s five schoolmates when they stabbed her 13 times till she dropped dead. Then they killed her dog, tried to set the house on fire after leaving the gas stove on to destroy evidence and decamped with valuables worth Rs 2.5 lakh. All were under 16, from rich, respectable families and had done a professional job of the murder. The reason: they had run up debts of thousands of rupees through a lavish life-style, visiting brothels and five-star hotels. Manoj Fafri, son of a senior Delhi administration official; Gaurav Kumar, son of a director of a research institute; and Somesh Tripathi, grandson of the late Kamlapati Tripathi; took Robin, a close friend for a drive. On a lonely stretch, they stabbed him to death. Reason: he was carrying Rs 45,000. Bored during their vacations, four rich boys who had just appeared for their high school exams in Delhi raided a house hoping to get jewellery and cash. Failing to find any, they cold-bloodedly tortured and killed owner Prem Gopal Nair by repeatedly ducking his head into a bucket of insecticide. Ten days later, they attempted another robbery, but were caught. They told the police that they wanted money to go to Mussoorie with their girlfriends. Sweeping social changes and new role models have combined to fuel a dramatic rise in teenage crime, causing concern to the police, sociologists and, above all bewildered parents. Sudipa Pal, 17, a ninth standard student in Calcutta, fed her parents and grandparents sweets mixed with poison after testing them on a pig. When they were dead, she tied all of them with electric wire and connected it to the mains to make it look like mass suicide. She eliminated them in the expectation that they would hinder her relationship with her tutor Randhir Bose, 51. She showed no sign of remorse. Appearing for her tenth standard exams shortly after, she scored distinction marks. Robbery. Murder. Rape. Car thefts. Kidnapping for ransom. These are crimes expected of hardened criminals. Not of your respectable neighbours 17-year-old son, or your mild-spoken college-going nephew. Or even your own daughter. Youngsters you trusted and knew), But with more and more teenagers from well-to-do families turning to crime, tremors of shock are rippling through Indian society, tor some youngsters, it is a shortcut to riches. Others, already rich, are bored teenagers looking for kicks. Whatever their motives, the facts are alarming enough to leave police and psychologists perplexed, parents anguished and schoolmates mystified. After his schoolmates killed Vora, Kapil Anand, 19, went into a state of depression and shock as he could not believe they could do it: ""I wondered if I could trust my friends because I just could not fathom how these cool rich guys could do this. No one suspected them."" Crack police teams in Calcutta did not suspect the nubile, but innocent-looking Pal of having the audacity to murder her parents and grandparents either. Says a police officer: ""Even after arresting her, we kept wondering if we had gone wrong somewhere."" Adds Neeraj Kumar, senior superintendent of police in Delhi: ""We can crack down on crime and criminals. But how do we control a sociological phenomenon driving teenagers to crime?"" He is referring to the fact that youngsters are more violent than ever before. They are in the forefront of riots and political violence. Campus crime has become too commonplace to shock. Their role models are Arun Gawli and Dawood Ibrahim. Many of these young criminals are not lumpen elements but bright youngsters looking for quick money to finance flashy life-styles. Out of 61.2 7 lakh officially registered crimes throughout the country in 1990, over 32.87 lakh were committed by those under 30. In metros like Delhi and Bombay as many as 70 per cent of those arrested for various crimes are under 25. In Bombay, 71 per cent of dacoities, 77 per cent of robberies and 74 per cent of murders were perpetrated by those under 25. Five years ago, there were just two or three teenagers involved in dacoities in Calcutta every year. Now it is more than ten times that figure. Points out Ajit Ghosh, Calcuttas deputy commissioner of police: ""Todays major criminals are aged between 18 and 22."" Even smaller places are seeing the trend. Eric Ekka, jailor at Sajiwa, Imphal, observes: ""Ruthless youngsters are seeing crime as a new way of life."" Of the 610 prisoners at his jail, 80 per cent are in their 20s. Criminologists and sociologists are worried that it can only get worse. Why are normal teenagers taking to crime? Experts offer a host of reasons but generalisations are often too superficial. Criminologist Shubral Sanyal of the National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science (NICFS) in Delhi believes that most affluent teenagers are lapsing into crime as a way of wreaking revenge on uncaring parents. ""Youth with incomplete lives fall into deviant behaviour to gratify themselves. The danger of crime makes them feel alive."" Dayal Mirchandani Bombay Psychiatrist Indifference and abuse instead of attention and affection can make emotional cripples of children. This cycle then culminates in deviant behaviour. Bombay psychiatrist Dayal Mirchandani says: ""Youngsters leading dissatisfied and incomplete lives get into deviant behaviour to gratify themselves. The excitement derived gives them a feeling of being alive."" Others blame it on social changes. Criminologist James Vadackumchery who works in Trivandrum believes: ""When society itself is becoming criminal and escapist, how can we expect our youngsters to behave differently?"" In a way, the teenager is only reflecting the chaos and aggression in society, its acquisitive urges, and the degeneration of values. The youth see cheats triumphing in exams, degrees being auctioned and jobs not necessarily going to the best candidate. This was best exemplified by the Mandal agitation during which scores of students in Delhi took to the streets and indulged in wanton violence. Many made human torches of themselves, frustrated that their merit and hard work were no longer valid criteria for college admissions and jobs. Todays youngster is cynical, angry, desperate. He sees gangster politicians, smugglers and underworld dons - even parents - getting rich and powerful through dubious means. Points out T.K. Oommen of the Centre for the Study of Social Systems at the Jawaharlal Nehru University: ""Before Independence, youngsters had a sense of purpose, fighting for freedom. Ghaziabad youth being punished for stabbing and looting Ghaziabad youth being punished for stabbing and looting But after that, values crumbled, corruption became institutionalised and anti-social elements grew in stature with illegitimate money. Catapulted into powerful positions, they commanded respect. The message sent out to the young was that this was the way of the world."" Says eminent sociologist M.N. Srinivas: ""We have not really taken the trouble to understand the teenage mind. How can we just blame them? Society itself has become violent and materialistic. Parents rarely empathise with their children, talk to them, help them out with their confusion or neutralise their frustrations."" Nuclear families are increasingly characterised by working parents who are treading a tightrope between home and work. While they spend lavishly on their children, they can end up denying them the care and the time they need, not to mention the discipline which has to be inculcated in the early years. Children who feel emotionally abandoned look elsewhere for companionship and acceptance. Take the case of three rich college girls from Shertallai in Kerala. Anju Joseph, 17, Sindhu Thomas, 18, and Safeena, 19, left home feeling lonely and angry. They wanted companionship and excitement. When the police caught up with them, they were part of an underworld gang in Goa. ""They were so mild-mannered. I still cant understand why they did it,"" says a friend of the trio. Wealthy Sirhan Shah, 19, who lives on Peddar Road in Bombay, stole three motorcycles and a Maruti car. Sirhan told the police that though his family had a car, he wanted his own, like his peers. For parents, seeing their children take to crime is traumatic. Teacher Shetram Mishra was stunned when his son, Siddhivinayak, 20, was arrested for forging a Rs 30,000-cheque: ""I have lost self-respect. But how can I disown him?"" ""Fear of the law has gone. Some trials take place after years. With the collapse of the judicial system, youth believe crime pays."" Subramaniam Ramamurthy Bombay Police Commissioner Divorce and separation add to the problem. Studies at Nirmala Niketan show that 60 per cent of juvenile delinquents come from broken families. Says Mohan Issac, assistant professor of psychiatry at nimhans: ""Squabbling parents are poor role models. Invariably, teenage criminals reflect the sorry situation at home."" Akram, 14, is a perfect example. His nights were often spent on Bombays pavements to escape abuse from his alcoholic father. Eventually, he fell into the company of teenage criminals who stole car carburettors. ""My father drove me to crime,"" he says. Abdul Sajid, 17, caught for house-breaking, hates his father who left when he was 10: ""I dont even want to see him."" Psychiatrist Shoba Srinath believes the only solution is for families to devote quality time to children and play an intimate role in their emotional growth. Police agree that most teenage criminals have emotional problems at home, primarily a communication problem with their parents. In New Delhi, police found that the millionaire parents of four school students involved in car stereo thefts had never bothered to find out why they stayed out late. They accused the police of framing their sons till the evidence was produced: stacks of car stereos in their childrens rooms which they were unaware of. The students said they did it ""for fun and adventure"". Police brutality hardens the young ones Police brutality hardens the young ones In todays parlance, fun for a teenager could mean anything. For Nakul Wahi, Dhruv Goyal, Sanjeev Jacob and Amar Upadhyaya, all from rich Delhi families, it meant driving a Maruti to Agra, wearing masks, and entering the house of ophthalmologist N.N. Aggarwal. They held him at gunpoint and looted cash and jewellery worth Rs 2.5 lakh while one of them sat in the car with a walkie-talkie set. When the police caught them, they discovered that the gang was well equipped and very well organised. The bottle of chloroform, the nylon ropes, the surgical gloves, the face masks and the pistol showed only too depressingly that their crimes were committed in cold blood and with total calculation. Says Pune-based lawyer-activist Aroona Nafday Goswami: ""Trying to be westernised, many parents keep away from their childrens rooms to give them space. So they have no idea what their children are seeing on the video or doing in their spare time. With modern-day pressures and values, parents find little time to instill discipline or respect for the law."" In Delhi, minors often drive cars to school. When the police hauled up dozens of such children outside Modern School, they nonchalantly paid the fines. Says Sub-Inspector Laxman Wagh in Bombay: ""Rich children feel everything can be bought. Even acquittal."" In the first half of March, Delhi Police cracked down on 323 children below 18. Traffic Commissioner Maxwell Pereira says criminally indulgent parents encourage such acts which symbolise how rich children are encouraged to fool around with the law. Says Madhava Menon, director of the National Law School of India University at Bangalore: ""Parents should be penalised as they should be responsible for what their children do."" ""Young criminals can be reformed by social workers rather than the police as their circumstances need to be investigated, not the crime."" Amodkanth Delhi Police Official Today, the formative years of a child are frittered away in a fast-moving world. While scholastic performance grabs the limelight, the emotional development is ignored. Personality profiles done by Bombay counsellor Shenaz Elavia on teenagers with criminal tendencies indicated poorly developed personalities. When children internalise their anxieties, they suffer emotional disorders. When they externalise them, they become anti-social - stubborn, aggressive and violent. Fuelling this trend is the breakdown of the system of criminal justice. Convictions take an eternity. When a case finally comes to trial, witnesses are untraceable. Teenagers arrested 20 years ago in Calcutta are yet to be convicted. Bombay Commissioner of Police Subramaniam Ramamurthy echoes a common concern: ""With the collapse of the criminal justice system, the message now is that crime pays."" Teacher Rukmani Srinivas in Bangalore says that students ridicule her when she talks of honesty as a value. They ask why they cant think of striking it rich when Harshad Mehta can make his millions and politicians get kickbacks. ""Twenty years ago, we wanted to work hard and build a career. Today, teenagers are looking for quick wealth,"" says K. Srinivas, inspector-general of police, Bangalore. Adolescence can often be a tremendously traumatic phase, with its agonies, frustrations, rages and uncertainties too easily underestimated by parents and laughed off by society. Peer pressure is overpowering and unless parents exert their own influence, youngsters whose characters are yet to crystalise can be swayed by friends values in their desperation to win approval. Tongminthang, 20, from Churachandpur, Manipur, broke away from drug addiction during a jail term in a drug-related case. But once free, he was dragged back into it by peer pressure. He found himself part of a gang stealing to finance their addiction, and is in jail again. Balaji (second from right) allegedly hired friends to kill a classmate to settle a score Balaji (second from right) allegedly hired friends to kill a classmate to settle a score If drugs are inflating juvenile crime figures, so is terrorism. Terrorists have always found it easy to lure teenagers in Punjab, Kashmir and the North-east. As Peter Ngahanyui, dig Crime, at Imphal, points out: ""Being between the ages of 16 and22, they are easy to indoctrinate."" Frankee Sema, 19, was lured from Kohima into a banned insurgent organisation. Carried away by ideological fervour at a camp in Burma, he was more than happy to rob a Shillong bank at gunpoint. But most criminologists argue that the prime motive for teenage crime is quick and easy money. Says B.N. Chattoraj, a professor at NICFS: ""Nowadays, the accent is on money and no one cares how it is acquired. So teenagers opt for the easiest way out as working hard is no longer the way to get it."" Crime files in every city have hundreds of examples: Mohanraj ,19, thought his hosiery unit job at Tirupur in Tamil Nadu would never make him rich. So he wrote an anonymous note to five-year-old actress Shyamlee saying that he had been paid Rs 50,000 to kill her and if she paid him Rs 1 lakh, he would eliminate her enemy. As he walked into a police trap, he confessed: ""I wanted to get rich quick."" The brutality involved can be chilling. Viswajeet, Vajpayee, Neeraj and Pawan had yet to turn 18 when they took a friend Arun Thapa, 16, to a secluded area in Delhi, hit him on the head with an iron rod till he died and threw him into a well. They did this as Thapa was demanding part of the money they had made from selling his mothers jewellery - itself stolen. Or consider the case of an army officer in Delhi numbed by the horror of his dynamic, popular young son taking to murder. At school, girls doted on him, cajoling him to take them out for coffee at the nearby Oberoi. Entertaining was expensive, Vikram Ramphal soon realised. He was drawn into the easiest way to make a fast buck - crime. Beginning with stealing video cassette recorders, he graduated to robberies carried out at knife-point. ""Teenagers with criminal tendencies are merely reflecting the increasingly violent and materialistic side of society."" M.N. Srinivas Bangalore Sociologist But when he cleaned up jewellery and cash worth Rs 3 lakh from his family doctors house, the police caught up with him. A jail sentence at Tihar merely hardened him. Soon after his release, he knifed to death R.P. Tuli, a rich New Delhi businessman, while robbing his house. When he was jailed again, he had yet to celebrate his 20th birthday. His parents have yet to recover from the shock. Parents agree that children today demand huge sums of pocket money. They take pride in discussing how their school-going children need over Rs 100 a day. Points out Kumar: ""The idea of entertainment has changed. We used to go to the theatre, listen to music or read. But today the youngster wants to be seen eating and shopping at upmarket places."" When the high-profile Vasavi Vidya Niketan School in Bangalore warned the parents of Balaji and Suraj, both 16, that they should not give their sons over a thousand rupees as pocket money, they were ignored. Balaji reportedly asked schoolmates Lathendra, 20, Bhaskar, 19 and Mahesh, 18, to kill Suraj after paying them Rs 3,500 and promising them more. The three did just that. Balaji, the son of a grain merchant, said he wanted to take revenge on Surajs parents for squabbling with his parents. For his classmates and teachers, this was almost unconceivable for they never thought the frail, bespectacled Balaji could be so vicious. In fact, the most troubling aspect of teenage crime is the senseless brutality. When Madhavi, 5, was kidnapped from Shakarpur in Delhi, her family found comfort only in close friend Ramesh, 22. He came every day to console the family and plead that they pay the Rs-4,000 ransom. But when he offered to talk to the kidnappers and got Madhavis clothes as evidence, the family informed the police. Somesh allegedly murdered his friend for money Somesh allegedly murdered his friend for money By then, he had killed her. Jhula, a 16-year-old orphan, was given all he wanted by his grandfather Bipin Sen. But when he demanded a motorcycle, Sen refused, arguing it was dangerous to drive in Calcutta. Jhula beat him to death. In Kanpur, two teenagers battered a cobbler because he didnt repair their chappals on time. Why has the teenager imbibed so much violence? Sociologists cite the overdose in films and on satellite television as the main reason. By the time the Indian child is in his teens, he has seen thousands of brutal acts on television and video. When Chandan, a Bangalore medical student, strangled his uncle to death in a car for the Rs 1 lakh he carried, he did it exactly the way he had seen it in The Godfather. Social workers and counsellors feel jailing and institutionalising youngsters are not the solutions. Families should be helped to establish a rapport with them, rebuilding a sense of values and purpose. Jails only corrupt them further. Calcuttas Deputy Commissioner of Police Prasun Mukherjee, is trying counselling. When Arvind Sen, a 10th standard student from a well-placed family in Calcutta was picked up by the police for stealing eight two-wheelers, Mukherjee did not arrest him. Instead, he counselled him and his parents who, all too predictably, could not believe it. They realised they had lost touch with their son as they were too busy with their careers. The real challenge lies in the years ahead. Little can be gained from pointing an accusing finger at the teenager alone. Society needs to take a hard, careful look at itself and the values it is promoting. ""With modern day pressures and values, parents have little time to instill discipline or respect for the law in their children."" Aroona Nafday Goswami Pune Lawyer As Srinivas points out tartly, we cannot sit back and pride ourselves on being a religious and spiritually-inclined society unless we take on the burden of instilling the right values in our children and taking concrete steps to stem the flood of materialism. It is too easy to disclaim responsibility for the crimes and misdemeanours of the next generation. Unless society believes these young criminals are inherently wicked, it should respond to their cries for help.",{},"['teenagers', 'teenage', 'children', 'rs', 'role', 'dramatic', 'rich', 'money', 'social', 'wanted', 'changes', 'parents', 'models', 'delhi', 'sweeping', 'youngsters', 'crime', 'rise']","They told the police that they wanted money to go to Mussoorie with their girlfriends.

"Aaj ka sawaal: While PM Modi is in Israel, where is Mr Kejriwal?","AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal, who used to take on PM Modi and the BJP on most issues of national significance until recently, has been conspicuous by his absence of late.",,2017-07-05T20:00:25+05:30,India Today,"Amidst the hectic political activities happening in the country and abroad, one person missing from action is Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener, who usually comments on all the crucial national issues and attacks Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP, of late is conspicuous by his absence. These days Kejriwal is not seen even on television channels giving sound bytes. Advertisements featuring him on TVs and radio channels have also done a vanishing act. At least three significant developments have taken place in the last one month. The presidential and vice presidential elections have been announced, historic economic reform in the form of Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been implemented and Narendra Modi became the first prime minister in about 70 years of Indias independence to embark upon a three-day visit to Israel. But the Delhi CM appears to be aloof from all these developments. His comments on mainstream and social media are hard to find. Otherwise, Kejriwal used to be at the forefront in criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his government and BJP on most of the issues. KEJRIWAL HAS NO LOCUS STANDI ON ISRAEL ISSUE: SOURCES Reacting on these three recent developments, sources close to Kejriwal told India Today that the Delhi CM does not have any locus standi on the Israel issue. Reminded that other opposition leaders were giving their opinion on it, they were of the view that Kejriwal had not been forthcoming on foreign matters. On GST, they said Kejriwal had taken part in a hangout on July 2 over the issue and also the alleged lynching over beef of Junaid a day before Eid. They said he had also ""retweeted"" some comments. On the presidential elections, they said the party had hinted that they would not support the candidature of BJPs candidate Ram Nath Kovind. However, in the past, the Delhi CM used to take an unequivocal stand on issues and would aggressively put forth his point of view. When the whole nation was celebrating over India launching surgical strikes against terrorists on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on September 29, 2016, Kejriwal was among the few opposition leaders who had doubted the military exercise. The Delhi CM had demanded that the Centre provide proofs of the surgical strikes. While doing so, he faced criticism in the country but was quoted extensively in Pakistan. KEJRIWAL CRITICAL OF DEMONETISATION Similarly, when PM Modi announced the demonetisation initiative at 8 pm on November 8, 2016, most of the people went euphoric. The move was hailed by most sections of society. But Kejriwal along with his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee led a campaign to demand a rollback of demonetisation. He even threatened PM Modi of ""revolt"" from the masses if notebandi was not withdrawn. But not any longer. Kejriwal has refrained from appearing on the national scene regarding any significant matter. He has confined himself to the national capital, attending to local issues.

These could be the seven reasons behind the Delhi CM taking a backseat: 1. DEFEAT IN ASSEMBLY POLLS Kejriwal was almost sure of winning the Assembly elections in Punjab and Goa held earlier this year. The drubbing in Punjab and the failure to open any account in Goa was embarrassing for the Delhi CM. His prestige was at stake in both these states because of the time and resources invested there. But a loss in both these states in his very attempt to expand AAPs base beyond the national capital proved a damp squib. 2. LOSS IN MCD ELECTIONS It was AAPs first election for controlling the three bodies of Municipal Corporation of Delhi. However, the party ruling in Delhi lost to BJP. This was no less a jolt than the defeat in Punjab and Goa Assembly elections because AAP is the ruling party here. 3. EMBARRASSMENT OVER EVM After the defeat in the two Assembly elections, Kejriwal alleged that the EVMs were tampered with to defeat AAP. He alleged that the EVMs were rigged to favour BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Goa and Congress in Punjab. He accused the Election Commission (EC) of playing into the hands of the Centre. He demanded that the EC hand over one EVM to AAP for 72 hours and it would prove that the software could be tampered with. EC accepted the challenge and invited not just AAP but all political parties to try their luck in proving that EVMs could be rigged. However, the parties, including AAP, backed out. This was again a loss of face for Kejriwal. 4. INTERNAL WRANGLINGS AAP has been beset with internal strife, particularly after the electoral defeats. Former Delhi minister Kapil Mishra has revolted against Kejriwal, levelling serious allegations of financial irregularities and improprieties against his chief minister. Around the same time, AAP co-founder and Kejriwals confidante Kumar Vishwas have fallen apart. The two were seen trying to harm each others political interests. A truce was sought to be brought about but it does not seem to be a permanent one. These have bogged Kejriwal down. 5. DEFAMATION CASES The defamation cases filed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley against Kejriwal and four others from AAP have weighed him down. Though the AAP convener is fighting the case and has appointed senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani to defend him, he appears to be on the defensive. Kejriwal has been seen trying to wriggle out of the case by prolonging it and buying time. 6. OFFICE OF PROFIT CASE Besides the revolt by three AAP MLAs, the sword of disqualification is also dangling over 20 of the 66 party legislators over the office of profit case. EC has ruled that it would continue hearing in the office of profit case. It has also signalled disqualification of the 20 MLAs. The final decision may come soon. If that happens, it would be the severest jolt that Delhis AAP government would receive so far. The judgment may also rob AAP of the moral authority to rule Delhi. Kejriwal may be forced to resign and call for mid-term election. 7. ED, CBI CASES Central investigative agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are examining cases lodged against AAP leaders including Kejriwal and his ministerial colleague Satyender Jain. ED has filed a case against AAP for allegedly diverting Rs 2 crore donations. A case is also pending over financing of ""secret spy squad"". BACK TO DELHI Kejriwal has apologised to the people of Delhi on two counts - for resigning in 2014 in a huff after 49 days of rule and for contesting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from a large number of seats in several states. While swearing in as CM during his second term on February 14, 2015, he had promised not to leave Delhi. However, he forgot his promise and did the opposite by trying to expand AAPs base to Punjab and Goa. While the party lost elections in both the states, Kejriwal lost face and Delhi lost administration and governance. While he and his party leaders were busy campaigning outside Delhi, Delhi was plagued with vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya. Kejriwal seems to have realised his folly. And its back to basics now for him.

"When in Mumbai, these are the 12 things one HAS to do","As Simply Mumbai celebrates its 12th anniversary, we look at the most interesting experiences the city has to offer.",,2016-10-24T17:18:05+05:30,India Today,"When Gregory David Roberts first attempts to paint a picture of Mumbai in Shantaram, he evokes the readers olfactory senses to describe the city. ""I could smell it before I saw or heard anything of India. Its the smell of gods, demons, empires, and civilizations in resurrection and decay. Its the blue skin-smell of the sea, no matter where you are in the Island City, and the blood-metal smell of machines. It smells of the stir and sleep and waste of sixty million animals more than half of them humans and rats,"" says Roberts protagonist Lin. In those few lines, Roberts describes so much that makes up Mumbai. And its not pretty. But beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder and Mumbai can be gorgeous to those who look closely enough. For Mahim-based author Jerry Pinto, the citys beauty is best experienced in the monsoon. ""Walking on Marine Drive in the rains. Its almost dangerous because the waves are angry and can even cross the road,"" he says of his favourite city experience. Whether it is enjoyed during a walk by the promenades, the beaches, a breezy drive by Worli Sea Link or from up in the air, the sea is indeed Mumbais saving grace. But as Suketu Mehta notes in Maximum City, ""There are many Bombays."" And while the New York-based author returned to the city to find his Bombay, we at Simply Mumbai celebrate our 12th anniversary in search of ours through some of the most interesting experiences the city has to offer. Here are 12 of our favourites. 1) Spot art in the most unlikely places Street art is not difficult to spot in Mumbai city, especially if youre a regular to Bandra and its several quaint little villages. Colourful, quirky, comical, some political and others blatantly Bollywood works of art adorn the walls surrounding the Portuguesestyle bungalows and old shops and bakeries in the area. Also, keep your eyes peeled for Mumbais most well known anonymous artist Tylers snarky graffiti and the giant tribute to Dadasaheb Phalke on Bandras MTNL building. In Juhu, youd be hard-pressed to dodge the art-full trees. Raasta Chaaps group of ladies has been dedicatedly painting dead rain trees to draw attention to the menace, leaving residents with brighter pavements. Thanks to the Snehal Patil-led Bombay Drawing Room, Santacruz station now has a tribute to Vincent Van Gogh as well as Monet. And if youre at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus this month, youre likely to experience a public art festival with artists including Owais Husain showcasing their work. 2) Escape to a green hiding place Mumbai is a crowded city, and we dont need numbers to prove it. Greenery is hard to find and quiet even more so. Unless you know exactly where to look or you know someone in the know. Author Jerry Pinto suggests early mornings at Sanjay Gandhi National Park. ""There are more butterfly species here, I am told, than in the whole of the UK,"" he says. But the national park in Borivali is a prime picnic spot in a city starved of space. For a truly secret location, youd be better off trusting Blue Bulbs Regan Rodricks or Nelson Fernandes, who will arrange for complete isolation in the midst of a forest-all within city limits. Rodricks favourite hideaway in Nala Sopara is a 25-minute hike which brings you to a waterfall and a lake where you can go kayaking. If youd rather skip the trek, hell show you the way to Shirgaon, a Virar wonder which has a lake but no falls. ""The secret location was discovered during a flight by a paragliding instructor, who doubles as a guide,"" reveals Rodricks. Contact bluebulb.in 3) Take in the aerial view of the city Mumbai looks magical from the skies. A helicopter ride is a great way to enjoy the views-the shimmering seas, the legoland skyscrapers, and the dazzling lights. Aman Aviation claims to be the first to have started the helicopter services about three years ago. They tied up with the IRCTC and operate from the Juhu aerodrome, offering rides of different durations for differing budgets. ""A fifteen minute ride will take you over Juhu, Bandra, Worli Sea Link and Dadar. Five minutes more and you can see the Queens Necklace over Marine Drive,"" reveals Mahesh Purushothaman, Aman Aviation. A ride over Colaba and the eastern side takes about 30 minutes. If youve got the budget for it, this is the one you should be doing so you dont miss the very tip of the city. ""The helicopters are three seaters, but most of our rides are taken by couples,"" reveals Purushothaman. No doubt, a number of marriage proposals happen up in the air. If you do go in for a 30-minute ride, carry along a picnic basket. Price Rs 9,900 onwards Contact helicoptertoursmumbai.in (for helicopter ride) 4) Walk among history Youd be forgiven if you said Mumbai pales in comparison to Delhi when it comes to the richness of its history. But to be fair, the city does have a rather intriguing past too. From the original Mumbaikars-the Kolis, to the Portuguese and then the British Raj, each community has left an enduring impact on the city. The stories can be found in the bylanes of Bandra and Byculla as well as the colonial buildings of South Mumbai. ""I think that every neighbourhood has its own unique story to share, which fit into and help illustrate the wider story or histories of Mumbai. The erstwhile Fort area, Colaba, the area north of Crawford Market, Bandra, Byculla, would be only some of my favourite parts of the city to explore,"" says Alisha Sadikot, who organises heritage walks across the city through The Inheritage Project. If youd like to know more about the living, thriving city, a great way to do it is to meet Harshvardhan Tanwar at dawn. The founder of No Footprints shows you how the city can be teeming with activity even as early as 5 a.m., taking you to Parel, Sassoon Docks, Crawford and Dadar markets. Contacts theinheritageproject.wordpress. com; facebook.com/nofootprintsmumbai 5) Sail into the open seas The monsoon is gone and the October heat has set in. This also means that the seas are open to the public once again. Yacht, sailboat, ferry-from luxury experiences to a choppy adventure-pick your preference.""Sailing is always a crowd-pleaser,"" claims Regan Rodricks, Blue Bulb, which organises two hour experiences that cost Rs 4000 for four people. This is an experience that wasnt available to the public until a few years ago. ""Id say grab the opportunity quickly before the government changes the rules again,"" he laughs. If youre looking for something a bit more exclusive, try The Happywala Weekend, which promises to host you on a yacht at a secret location or plan your own party with Gateway Charters, which rents out luxury motor yachts, speedboats or sailboats. Contacts gatewaycharters.in/; facebook. com/The-Happywala-Weekend 6) Join the midnight cyclists Mumbai might not have dedicated cycle tracks, but it certainly does have an extremely active cycling community. A monsoon ride, an Independence Day ride, a long ride to Lonavala, a short ride down Carter Road-youll find a cycling group for every mood. If youre comfortable on a two-wheel ride, a night ride would be the best way to enjoy the city. While some of these are paid events, most are open to all and encourage a sense of community. Avid cyclist and author Rakesh Bakshi enjoys getting riders together to appreciate the citys heritage structures by night. Sunil Gandhi organises night rides to hit the citys after-hours restaurants, while Bichanixs Zubair Lodi organises fun rides. ""Those who dont have their own, can rent cycles from us at Rs 70 per hour. We usually go for two or three hours to explore the city by night,"" says Lodi. The group always stops for a bite at the citys favourite food spots Haji Ali Juice Centre, Bachelorss and the likes. For those who dont mind pitching in for a ride, Some Place Elses The Mightnight Trail is also a good option. They allow you to rent a cycle for Rs 975 and usually ride from Bandra to Worli and back. Contacts facebook.com/Bichanix; facebook.com/SomePlaceElseIndia 7) Experience magnificence at the Royal Opera House For 25 years now, the Royal Opera House has been deprived of its former glory. Thanks to restoration architect Abha Narain Lamba, under the patronage of the royal Gondal family, the countrys last remaining opera house is going to open its doors not just to the finest performances from across the globe, but also to dialogue, debate, and discourse. ""The Royal Opera House in this new avatar is our gift to the city of Mumbai,"" says Gondal Maharaja Jyotendra Sinhji Jadeja. On October 20, the Opera House reopens with the inauguration of the 18th Jio Mami Film Festival. ""The very next night, we have an operatic performance paying homage to its heritage,"" reveals Asad Laljee, in-charge of programming. Thrilled that the ""cultural jewel"" of Bombay is back, Laljee reveals that he is hoping to get children to visit the space too. ""It would be a great way for them to learn about our heritage and its restoration,"" he says. After the private events in October, the opera house will take a bit of a breather and open to the public in November. Contact Royal Opera House, Charni Road 8) Be part of the countrysbest wine club When youve got the countrys only Master of Wine in the city, why would you go to anyone else to find you the best vino in the world? Launched late last month, Sonal Hollands Soho Wine Club is a membership-based club for the citys wine lovers. Appalled at how few wines are accessible in the markets in Mumbai, Holland uses her expertise to curate the best wines from across the globe.""Soho is devoted to wine lovers who want to be part of a community. People always ask me what to drink, where to buy it; this was always a dream for me,"" says Holland. As part of the club, members receive regular reading materials on wine. ""But to really know wine, you must taste as much as you can,"" she adds. And so Holland plans to organise as many events in the city as possible. Contact sohowineclub.in/ 9) Sniff out a secret music session Secret Roof/ Secret Sessions is a closed Facebook group; its 865 members are the only ones invited for the sessions musicians Aditya Jasiwal, Ankit Mansukhani, Abhishek Kukrety, Davind Handa and Chirayu Vedekar host on private rooftops across the city. ""Our sessions began as a way to give each other a platform, but we are now working hard at not attracting too much attention,"" admits Jaiswal. Attempting to offer a range of music options, these secret sessions include electronic as well as live music. If the underground rap scene seems more enticing, you could look up Battle Bars Bombay, who organise themed battles. ""At the end of October we have three battles, all related to comic book themes such as Deadmau5 vs Mickey Mouse, Shaktimaan vs Superman, and so on,"" says Vineet Nair aka Poetik Justis, who is currently also working on building a Freestyle Fraternity. ""Itll be an all-freestyle rap-based concept where we go right off the dome. No practiced lyrics or nothing,"" he adds. Contacts facebook.com/groups/993255020753742/ (Secret Sessions); facebookcombattlebarsbombay 10) Say hello to the Flamingoes at Sewri Birwatching in the city can be surprisingly satisfying. One might think that pigeons, crows, kites and the occasional sparrow crowd the skies, but keep your eyes open for birds of a different feather and you do find them. The Coppersmith Barbet, a tiny green bodied, red headed, whiskered bird, is Mumbais official bird. Its shy, but extremely common and is often spotted around large peepal trees. But its the pink flamingoes that begin their visit to the city every year around October or November and stay till March that bring the most excitement to bird lovers in the city. The Sewri mudflats become home for these birds for months and the Sewri jetty offers an expansive view of the flock. If youd like to join a birdwatching session to learn a thing or two about the longlegged beauties, a tour with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) are a great bet. Contact bnhs.org 11)Savour some of the finest meals in the mills Mumbai before the 1980s mill strike was a very different sight to see. Cotton mills had dotted central Mumbai then. The 1990s brought a surge of redevelopment, turning several mills into unsightly malls. Luckily, recent times have brought more tasteful, culturally inclined developments in the old industrial plots. So the G5A Foundation for Contemporary Culture finds a home at the Laxmi Mills Compound in Mahalaxmi and the Nine Fish Art Gallery comes to The New Great Eastern Mills compound in Byculla. The various mills across the city have also become hubs for exciting restaurants and restobars. Kamala Mills is home to Bombay Canteen, which serves some of the most exciting food in the city. Laxmi Mills has Masque, the citys first restaurant to have a rotating set menu that depends solely on the produce available to Chef Prateek Sadhu and his team. Magazine Street Kitchen, in the industrial Devidayal Estate in Reay Road, is another experimental space to keep track of for foodies in the city. Contact 022-2499 1010 (Masque); facebook.com/MagStreetKitchen 12) Find a friendly neighbourhood performance space The NCPA in Nariman Point has for decades been the citys premier performance space, and continues to be because of its exciting productions (this year theres Mughal-e-Azam and Reth) and fantastically curated performances. ""But more recently theres been a trend of smaller performance spaces, which are providing opportunities to a lot more performers. Apart from The Cuckoo Club in Bandra, CLAP in Malad, there are so many pubs that are open to performers,"" notes Deepa Gahlot, Head - Programming (Theatre & Film). Bandra also has NSPAs QTube Cafe, while South Mumbais Ballard Estate has Yiamas, an experimental space that ""gives you the opportunity to weave stories to complement your memories."" Last month saw an exciting range of theatrical performances from YouTheatre including Bandar ki Baraat, The Storytellers and Alexander vs Chanakya. Besides these performance spaces, you might walk into a neighbourhood pub, brewery or caf and be pleasantly surprised with a comedy act or a play. If you drop in at AntiSOCIAL, in the basement of Khar Social-""a raw, un-programmed and un-regulated space for the social outliers""- youll always be in for a surprise. Poetry readings, workshops, pow wows, art exhibitions, musical evenings, design showcases, screenings, and literary evenings-theres something for everyone.

"Viral videos stoke celebrities' images, show guileless snapshots of their innate coolness","Mila Kunis' stardom went up a notch last week, and you would think it's because she stars in the biggest movie of the year so far.",,2013-03-13T17:11:43+05:30,India Today,"Mila Kunis stardom went up a notch last week, and you would think its because she stars in the biggest movie of the year so far. But Oz the Great and Powerful, which debuted with $79.1 million at the box office, had little to do with the sudden rush of adulation that engulfed Kunis. Instead, it was a seven-minute viral video thats been watched more than 10 million times and blogged about the world over. The Great and Powerful isnt Oz, but the Internet, which can burnish a stars image just as it can destroy it. The video, youve surely seen by now, is from a press junket interview for Oz with a young BBC radio personality, Chris Stark. Stark begins by announcing hes ""petrified"" at doing such an interview for the first time. But hes obviously quite comfortable as his own version of Hugh Grant, charmingly peppering Kunis with questions about pub drinking, his local soccer club in Watford and a theoretical day out together. He expects to earn ""massive lad points,"" he says. Kunis is exceptionally winning: She happily goes along, eager for a break from a day of monotonous TV interviews promoting the film. When Stark moves to return to more normal questions, she protests: ""Why? This is such a better conversation."" The clip was roundly greeted online as proof of Kunis ""awesomeness."" (Google ""Mila Kunis is awesome"" and youll get countless links rhapsodizing about the interview.) New York Magazines Vulture blog hailed ""a brand-new inductee into the most-adored-actress-ever club."" Whats emerging is a new kind of stardom propelled by glimpses of authenticity circulated on the Web like evidence of a stars real nature: guileless snapshots of their innate coolness. Internet videos are known for elevating anonymous people to renown, but they can greatly enhance the reputations of the famous, too. Kunis went viral because the interview confirmed her image: Shes funny, sarcastic and game. She banters just as well in real life as she does in the romantic comedies she stars in. It was the same when, in 2011, Ryan Gosling was captured in a cell phone video on a New York City intersection helping to stop a fight in the street. There was Gosling, wearing a baseball hat and carrying groceries, humbly playing the role of hero, just as he sometimes does in the movies. Stars arent just like us, we think; theyre just like their screen personas.

Stars arent just like us, we think; theyre just like their screen personas. Jennifer Lawrence most recently experienced a similar surge after her best actress Oscar win. You would expect the award - a mountain peak for any actress - would have been the dominant conversation the next day about the 22-year-old Lawrence. But more than the Academy Award, she was lauded online for her backstage demeanor. Facing reporters, she confessed to taking a shot beforehand, flashed the middle finger and laughed at herself for falling on the stairs on her way to the stage. She was perfectly self-deprecating and unpolished. Angelina Jolies right leg became a star in its own right after the 2011 Oscars Angelina Jolies right leg became a star in its own right after the 2011 Oscars Millions watched videos of her backstage, and more than 5 million viewed an ABC News interview with Lawrence from later than evening. It captured Lawrences astonished reaction when Jack Nicholson introduced himself to her. A Lawrence mythology was in full flourish.Another Oscar-winner, the director Ang Lee, was captured after the Academy Awards in an Instagram photo. The tuxedo-clad director ofwas candidly spied clutching his statuette in one hand, and chomping on an In-N-Out burger in the other. Vanity Fair declared ""Even housing an In-N-Out Burger is adorable when Ang Lee does it.""Becoming a meme holds a lot more risk than reward. Certainly, Tom Cruise would rather certain Scientology videos hadnt hit the Internet. Its unlikely Angelina Jolie was pleased her right leg became a star in its own right after the 2011 Oscars. Alec Baldwin detested that private phone messages from him to his daughter leaked online. (Charlie Sheen appeared to love every bit of his ""Winning,"" but few stars desire the same kind of publicity.)Even Gosling, who also became a meme that flaunted his sensitivity with photo captions beginning ""Hey Girl,"" is ambivalent about the Internet. In a recent interview, he said the experience of the street video made him hesitant to get involved, ""even if its the right thing to do.""""The Internet has just become a bit of a minefield,"" he said. ""I try not to go in there. Its funny, I think about that time Fabio was on a rollercoaster and got hit in the face with a pigeon. I think about that a lot. I feel like that pigeon.
