BOOZE RUINS LIVES!,“THE wake-up call for me should have been the day a bullet blew my hat off.”.,Jabu Kumalo,2018-08-15T14:30:02.000Z,DailySun,"“THE wake-up call for me should have been the day a bullet blew my hat off.” These were the words of Mussolini Shumi, who has managed to stop drinking thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He told Daily Sun he sometimes couldn’t believe he was still alive after all the drinking and criminal activities he was involved in. Speaking about the day he almost lost his life, Mussolini said: “We were coming back from a soccer match between Chiefs and Sundowns when we decided to rob a guy. “There were four of us and we thought he was an easy target because he was with a woman. “As we tried to grab him, he pulled out a gun and fired at us. The first bullet hit my friend and severely injured him. “We scattered all over the place and he kept on shooting. I felt my hat leaving my head as it was hit by a bullet. “Every time I think about that moment, I sweat a bit.” Mussolini said they later learned the man was a soldier. He said thanks to AA, he was happy to say he no longer lived a rough and dangerous life. To show his gratitude, Mussolini and some members of his AA group in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, will be holding a rally this Saturday. He said the aim of the imbizo was to spread the message to those still ruled by alcohol that there was hope for them. The imbizo will be held at Tsolo Hall on Makau Street from 9am. The venue is close to the well-known Change Bible Church. Mussolini, who has been sober for 10 years, said: “After being involved in two car accidents while driving a company car, I knew I needed help or I would die. “I decided to tell my employers the truth and was booked into rehab. When I came out, I joined AA and the past 10 years have been pure bliss.”Mussolini said anyone who thinks they might have a drinking problem should attend the event to find a solution.",{},"['aa', 'booze', 'hit', 'lives', 'decided', 'involved', 'ruins', 'imbizo', 'day', 'drinking', 'mussolini', 'thanks', 'hat']","He told Daily Sun he sometimes couldn’t believe he was still alive after all the drinking and criminal activities he was involved in.

Ladies stop panicking, as there are escort agencies you can call since you are so desperate to be seen with good-looking men. You can hire a man you know. Especially if you don’t have one, but want one for pictures and company.You could always pose next to a hot stranger in a restaurant, if you have to have a picture.Church is another place you’re likely to find a kind and godly young man willing to have a free meal.Look, I don’t get why ladies are so desperate to be paired up, but stay away from the usual suspects: Stay away from married men and give their wives a chance. Please, run toward the opposite direction if you see Nico Matlala, as the “heartbreaker” will leave you heartbroken – I still don’t get it. Stay away from your ex, no matter how horny you are this Wednesday, as nothing has changed. Other people’s boyfriends are off limits, like yours. A date after 10pm is not a date but a booty call. Stay away from dating acquaintances we can’t trace, like men who take girls to Dubai only to leave them there. Ensure a friend knows your location at all times, as these strangers you date become our problem. One celebrity dated a thief who stole shoes for her. Stay away from men who raise their voice and will inevitably hit you.Look ladies, I still don’t know why you are so desperate to be wooed, taken out and fed when it’s so nice indoors and it’s a week night.Also, can all the men who believe they’ve made it in life please just stay at home with their wives this Valentine’s Day and evening.

NAIR MAY GO FOR MENTAL HEALTH CHECK!,HE called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video.,Sun Reporter,2018-10-02T09:34:03.000Z,DailySun,"HE called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video.And now the Verulam Family Court is expected to make a ruling on Tuesday on whether Kessie Nair can apply for bail or be sent for mental observation before applying for bail.State prosecutor Carlson Govender and Nair's attorney Chris Gounden submitted their final arguments on Monday afternoon on the state's application that Nair be sent for a 28-day mental assessment at Fort Napier Hospital in Pietermaritzburg.Nair - the former Durban councillor and convicted fraudster who called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video - has been charged with six counts of crimen injuria and two of incitement of public violence.Govender argued that Nair should be treated as an in-patient at Fort Napier.He said the court should consider the evidence of a district surgeon who examined Nair on the day of his first court appearance, the evidence of Nair's brother Krishnan and that of the investigating officer Warrant Officer Ajay Lutchnan.The district surgeon had found that Nair showed no signs of mental illness but recommended that he should be sent to Fort Napier for 28 days, the court heard.Krishnan told the court that he noticed ""changes"" in Nair's mental state when he visited him at Westville prison on ""numerous occasions"".Lutchnan told the court that there was a time when he couldn't understand what Nair was saying when he took his fingerprints on the day of his arrest.Lutchnan said they had interacted about Nair's time in prison and about Nair ""belonging to a 26 section of the prison"".However, Gounden hit back at the state's witnesses.""The district surgeon is incompetent to do a mental observation, has no qualifications to deal with someone's mind and lacked expertise to make such an assessment. The district surgeon recommended that the accused be sent to Fort Napier but found that he had no signs of mental illness, which is contradictory,"" argued Gounden.His said Krishnan's evidence should not be considered because ""he can't manage his own affairs"" and had also ""sought assistance"".Krishnan had admitted in court that he was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous but said he had been clean for two and a half years.Gounden also argued that Nair should have been summoned to appear in court instead of being arrested. He said most people who were facing crimen injuria cases had only been summoned to appear in court.https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/court-to-rule-on-whether-kessie-nair-must-be-sent-for-mental-observation-prior-to-bail-application-20181002",{},"['surgeon', 'district', 'nairs', 'fort', 'napier', 'sent', 'health', 'evidence', 'nair', 'mental', 'check', 'court']","Govender argued that Nair should be treated as an in-patient at Fort Napier.

XOLANI RAN 90KM ON HIS CRUTCHES,"HE STARTED the race in the middle of the night, facing 90km of tarred road and relying on his crutches and his will to succeed.",CHARLES BALOYI,2018-06-12T12:00:25.000Z,DailySun,"HE STARTED the race in the middle of the night, facing 90km of tarred road and relying on his crutches and his will to succeed. Fifteen hours and 50 minutes later he crossed the finish line at Moses Mabhida Stadium a national hero.  BUT HIS JOURNEY TO RECOVERY STARTED MANY YEARS AGO UNDER A STORMWATER BRIDGE. Amputee Xolani Luvumo, a 34-year-old weekend athlete who works at a perfume factory in Pretoria, completed his first Comrades Marathon, running on crutches with only one leg.Xolani’s parents abandoned him when he was young. He lived with his gogo in the Eastern Cape. After his gogo died, young Xolani lived with his uncle. But soon his life spiralled out of control and he started a life on the streets.“I became addicted to nyaope. I was arrested and sentenced for using and selling drugs,” he said. He spent five years in prison and lost his leg to bone cancer. When he left prison, he lived under a bridge for seven years, still addicted to nyaope.Then, on 26 April 2016, his life changed when he met Hein Venter, who gave him a second chance. Venter was driving home one night and saw Xolani. He was moved to help him.Xolani went to rehab and attended Alcoholics Anonymous. “Venter means everything to me. For the first time I felt I was a man,” Xolani said. Venter said: “I saw Xolani on crutches and I decided to give him a chance. I offered him a job and he is now living in a flat in Mamelodi.”In September 2016 Xolani took part in a 5km fun run and in May 2017 he took part in his first 21km race. Last year he did his first marathon. When Xolani entered the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Sunday afternoon he was given a standing ovation. Xolani said radio stations like SAfm and Radio 702 phoned him and fans lined up at the Pinetown Premier Hotel for autographs. Xolani’s message is that people must not allow disability to get them down. His dream is to represent South Africa at the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.“Nothing beats the feeling of receiving a hero’s welcome from a big crowd,” he said.",{},"['xolani', 'young', '90km', 'took', 'ran', 'saw', 'lived', 'crutches', 'life', 'stadium', 'venter', 'started']","HE STARTED the race in the middle of the night, facing 90km of tarred road and relying on his crutches and his will to succeed.

They pay their money to come to stadiums to see their club – only to go home disappointed. “They stayed in the club until the wee hours of the morning.” Another source further claimed: “They had Durban girls all over them and the mood was like they had won the cup. While, in fact, they were supposed to be resting and preparing for the game. “Instead, they were dancing and drinking booze the whole night. “Some were enjoying their wine and others were getting busy with Durban’s hotties.” Azar’s manager, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “We won’t be able to help you with that. “We have a lot of customers and we don’t ask them who they are and where are they from.” Qalinge said: “I won’t say we did or did not, but clearly you must be beware that such information is not true.” Bucs spokesperson, Thandi Merafe, said she wouldn’t comment on the issue, if we didn’t reveal our sources. Rakhale, Mhlongo and Memela refused to comment.",{},"['allegedly', 'babalas', 'orlando', 'source', 'thabo', 'club', 'bucs', 'pirates', 'drinking', 'wont', 'went', 'players']","ORLANDO PIRATES players allegedly escaped from their Three City Hotel at Umhlanga Rocks in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal.
