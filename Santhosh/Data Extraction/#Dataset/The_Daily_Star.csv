Serenity in the South China Sea,"The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of America's unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over.",Gareth Evans,2015-07-03T00:00:00+06:00,The Daily Star,"Diplomats and alcoholics dont always have as much in common as is sometimes assumed. But there is useful guidance for policymakers in the Reinhold Niebuhr prayer that Alcoholics Anonymous has made its own: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Americas response to Chinas rise – and in particular to its assertiveness in the South China Sea – is a case in point. The United States should accept many dimensions of Chinas economic, and now military, growth with as much serenity as it can muster. But there are some that call for pushback, and the jury is still out on Americas capacity to make the right calls. The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of Americas unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over. Economically, the writing is on the wall. Despite US opposition to Chinas Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, much of the region has embraced it. And, again despite US resistance, it seems inevitable that the renminbi will join the International Monetary Funds reserve-currency basket. Then there is the immense difficulty the US is having in bringing its China-excluding Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact to fruition. Militarily, while the US will remain the dominant global power for the foreseeable future, its absolute superiority in East Asia is no longer unchallenged. The dramatic build-up of Chinas military (especially naval) capability is no more than can be expected of a hugely trade-dependent regional superpower. It is not easy for some US leaders to say so publicly, but most acknowledge privately that America can no longer expect to have the seas and skies to itself. Its role will necessarily be scaled back to that of regional counterweight. But how far should serenity extend when it comes to the South China Sea? This is the most sensitive geopolitical issue looming over Xis state visit to the US in September. China has been stretching the limits of regional (and US) tolerance with its expansive sovereignty claims and massive land-reclamation activity – some 2,000 acres in the last 18 months – on Fiery Cross Reef and elsewhere. Pushback is required, but within defined limits. What critics of Chinas land reclamation need to understand is that, even without any credible sovereignty claims to the sea area in question, or any islands within it, under international law China does have the right to build artificial islands and installations, including airstrips, on outlying reefs and shoals. The Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have been doing so for years in the Spratly Islands, albeit on a smaller scale. Although such installations must be for “peaceful purposes,” that does not necessarily exclude some military presence, provided the intent is non-aggressive. The US cannot stop such activity and should not try. What it can do is make clear that reclamation activity does not, by itself, provide a foundation for any new sovereignty claim or exclusionary activity. The reclaiming country can set a 500-meter “safety zone” around such installations. That is all. China cannot claim a 12-mile territorial sea or a 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ); nor can it put in place an air defense identification zone or any other kind of military exclusion operation. And the US is within its rights to make this point by flying surveillance aircraft to within 500 meters of such installations. As for Chinas broader sovereignty claims, again some distinctions are necessary. To the extent that these claims are based on the “nine-dashed line” – embracing some 80 percent of the South China Sea and described as Chinas “historic waters” – the entire international community should reject them out of hand. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) – now generally accepted as customary international law even by countries that, like the US, have failed to ratify it – is the only credible framework within which any kind of exclusive claims can be made. On the other hand, to the extent that Chinas claims are based on long use or occupancy of particular habitable islands in the Spratly or Paracel groups or elsewhere (and as such consistent with UNCLOS, to which China is a party), they may be as credible as those of other regional players, if not more so. So the US and other outsiders are right not to take sides about competing claims, and to urge that they be resolved by negotiation or international adjudication, not by force. Pending resolution of these competing claims, it is also appropriate, in the course of asserting the right to freedom of navigation, that the US and others treat as a de facto sovereign exclusion zone a 12-mile perimeter around such islands. After all, if they are not owned by China, they are owned by someone. As with the reef installations, the wise course is to minimise provocation. On the issue of freedom of navigation, China should be believed when it says that it is not in the business of obstructing commercial shipping or flights anywhere in the South China Sea. But it has created difficulties for the US – and a continuing risk of inflammatory incidents – by insisting that, within the entire 200-mile EEZ extending beyond its territorial waters, no military ship or aircraft has a right to engage in surveillance and intelligence collection. American pushback on this front, though justified, should be tempered. In the interest of defusing tensions, the US should scale back its monitoring activities within Chinas EEZs and rely more on less obviously intrusive means. Managing the US-China relationship in general, and the South China Sea in particular, requires, above all, keeping official rhetoric under control. Lines will need to be drawn, but wise leaders will focus on cooperative diplomatic solutions, playing military cards to the minimum extent possible – and perhaps repeating to themselves, the AA serenity prayer before creating expectations that they cannot meet.

Anonymous people and the insidious logic of petrol bomb terror,"POLITICAL violence is as old as the memory of our nationhood stretches back. Between the rise and fall of regimes, what appears again and again is the cycle of political violence.",,2015-02-10T00:00:00+06:00,The Daily Star,"POLITICAL violence is as old as the memory of our nationhood stretches back. Between the rise and fall of regimes, what appears again and again is the cycle of political violence. Given this habitual co-existence with violence, it is all too easy for us to take the recent petrol bomb phenomenon as a continuous chapter in the rather darkly illustrated history of political violence. Such a generalisation, however justified, glosses over the insidious logic of this petrol bomb phenomenon. The logic of the petrol bomb terror, as I will try to show below, registers a qualitative break from the previous forms of political violence. There is something extraordinary about the widespread attacks on public transportation across the country. With the risk of simplifying it, it could be argued that the ordinary forms of political violence have a palpable object -- they erupt over evident contests over interests. In quotidian life, the clash among political factions and parties over the control of institutions subjects ordinary citizens to violence and suffering. Granted, the terror involved in, say, taking siege of residential halls or forcefully extracting money from businessmen, result in obvious cases of political violence. However, while the victims of such politically-grounded violence suffer in multiple ways, the logic behind ordinary political violence revolves around the questions of interests and power. In other words, these forms of commonplace political violence are primarily a result of the clash over power and material interests, while the mass public is the necessary collateral damage of such violent processes. In contrast, the public is no longer the collateral damage, but the very target of the petrol bomb attacks. The anonymous people, to put it simply, are chosen as victims precisely because of their identity as the public. Most political violence in our recent history happened on the basis of group-identity. Curiously enough, the targets of petrol bombs are neither singled out because of their specific socio-cultural identity nor are they chosen on the basis of their political affiliation. Their identity, as it were, is the very absence of any specific identity. The other name of this apparently nameless entity is the people, or what we call janata in Bangla. The choice of public transportation is significant both for practical and symbolic reasons. In a city like Dhaka where public space is quickly dwindling, streets and public transportations are the crucial spaces that bring together strangers and generate images of publicness. It is no exaggeration to say that streets and public transportation symbolise the very idea of the public. Not surprisingly, public transportations on the streets have been a site of political intervention for quite some time. Hartal, for example, is a political strategy that seeks to mount pressure on the authority by way of keeping the vehicles off the streets (forcefully or not). During hartal, the political activists often choose to vandalise vehicles with the aim of reinforcing the strike. Yet, despite this formal similarity, it would be mistaken to compare hartal-related violence with the petrol bomb attacks. Vandalism associated with hartal generally targets vehicles, not the passengers inside them. In addition, hartal violence is often for the sake of forcefully reinforcing strike -- it is not necessarily violence for the sake of violence. On the contrary, petrol bombs are directly aimed at the helpless passengers called the people. To an extent, the petrol bomb attacks are violence for the sake of it. Historically, streets are at the forefront of all sorts of politics in Bangladesh. Whether it is a mass movement or an inter-political-party contest, the contention inevitably spills over to the street. And this is understandable. Given the weak nature of our political institutions, streets are the most significant sites of political mobilisation and pressure-generation. The politics of occupying streets often gets violent, resulting in forceful intimidation of the public. Even in 2006, when the political order faced a problem akin to the contemporary one, the then-opposition party, Awami League, attempted to force the government to accept their demands by way of occupying the streets, however forcefully. The BNP and other oppositional parties -- perhaps owing both to the authoritarian grip of the present government and their failure to effectively mobilise activists so as to take control of the streets -- are failing to provide any semblance of popular legitimacy to their protest. The resultant vacuum has taken an insidious trajectory. Instead of building the oppositional movement on and around the street, the oppositional elements have chosen to attack the street and the public who occupy them. This development is as anti-democratic as it can get. I conclude with such a bold statement for two reasons. Firstly, this petrol bomb strategy is seeking to destabilise the ruling order not by confronting the regime itself, but by way of attacking the mass public with terroristic means. Secondly, this strategy amounts to nothing but a desire to destroy the political agency that the people hold. The underlying strategy that informs the petrol bomb phenomenon is not difficult to discern. The petrol bomb violence, and the fearful environment it is giving birth to, is expected to produce a situation that facilitates interventions from extra-political actors. This underlying direction registers a profound distrust not so much in the ruling regime, but rather in the people themselves. This is the most terrifying flame of the disastrous petrol bomb fire. The images of the burnt bodies of the victims are haunting enough. But the anti-people logic of the petrol bomb phenomenon is going to leave an even deeper scar in our already disfigured democratic body. Mired in this intricate situation, the government is taking recourse to the brute forces that can never address the political crisis at the heart of the problem. Mirroring the opposition party, the government is effectively failing to garner any political legitimacy from the people who themselves have become the new target of terror. Nothing can be more shameful for a democratic polity than the act of appealing to a higher authority that is not the people. Worse still, the petrol bomb phenomenon is making room for the extra-political authorities by attacking the people themselves. This is a grim instance in our political history. The law enforcement forces are not going to rescue us from this political nightmare. What is needed is the subversion of the inherent political logic of the petrol bomb phenomenon, a task that can only be accomplished in the very name of the nameless targets of petrol bombs.

How is he doing?,"Set in a serene location, Sunrise Guest House is a lavishly built two-storey building with a neatly furnished drawing room, four large bedrooms, plush bathrooms, a well-decorated library and a spacious, lush lawn at the front. There's also a mini bar with alcoholic beverages.",,2015-07-27T00:00:42+06:00,The Daily Star,"Set in a serene location, Sunrise Guest House is a lavishly built two-storey building with a neatly furnished drawing room, four large bedrooms, plush bathrooms, a well-decorated library and a spacious, lush lawn at the front. Theres also a mini bar with alcoholic beverages. This is where Salahuddin Ahmed, BNPs joint secretary general, has been staying. The BNP leader is facing trial for illegally entering the state of Meghalaya in India. Upon a visit to the luxurious guest house on Thursday, this correspondent found that Salahuddin, who has rented two rooms on the first floor, is the lone guest at the house. He was seen browsing through four newspapers -- one Bengali daily and three English dailies -- published from Assam. Apart from his personal assistant, there are a manager, two caretakers and two gardeners at the house, which is located in a highly secure area as it is very close to the local offices of Indian Air Force and an intelligence agency. Sources at the house said he has rented the rooms for 4,000 Indian rupees (Rs) per day for two months, which amounts to a total of nearly two and a half lakh rupees. Asked about how he was paying the rent, he refused to make any comment on anything while at the guest house on the ground of being under constant watch. However, when this correspondent had met him on the premises of a Shillong court on Wednesday, he had agreed to talk. He had gone there to appear before the court. ""How are your days going in Shillong?"" this correspondent had asked. ""Doesnt this go without saying? My health is not that good. I need to see a doctor. My back pain is worsening. I dont want to take the risk of undergoing a surgery. Lets see what the doctors do,"" Salahuddin answered, buying a betel leaf from a vendor on the premises. ""Dont you want to return home?"" ""Of course I do. But its a legal issue, so I wont comment on this. My lawyer will speak on my behalf,"" he replied, pointing to his lawyer SP Mahanta, who was standing beside him. Before the reporter could ask him anything, Mahanta smiled and chipped in, ""Its not yet the time to speak about this."" Asked how his Eid day was, Salahuddin went silent for a while and then lamented, ""After a long time, I spent an Eid away from my family."" ""How long will you stay at the rented guest house?"" this correspondent asked. ""I wont stay there much long. I am thinking of shifting to a new place,"" Salahuddin said. During the conversation, he congratulated Bangladesh cricket team, especially Soumya Sarker and Mustafizur Rahman, for their recent feats against Pakistan, India and South Africa. WHO PAYS THE RENT? Indian intelligence sources said although Salahuddin is supposed to pay nearly Rs 2.4 lakh (Tk 2.9 lakh) for 60 days, he managed to rent it only for Rs 80,000 with the help of some locally influential people. A high official of Shillong police said, “We will investigate if any payment is being made illegally. We need to know where an intruder is getting the money from."" The official, who wished to remain anonymous, said Salahuddin has good ties with a number of influential stone businessmen on Dauki border. ""They may have provided him the money."" However, Hilabarth Martho, manager of the guest house, said Safayet Hossain, a nephew of the BNP leader, paid Tk 60,000 last month though they are yet to receive the rest of the amount. The owner of the guest house skirted around a query about Salahuddins rent payment. The BNP leader had been arrested on May 11 by Meghalaya police and sued under the Foreigners Act for trespassing. He was allegedly picked up by plainclothes officials from a house in Uttara on March 10, according to his family members. The law enforcers, however, denied the allegation. After the arrest, Salahuddin was initially sent to MIMHANS mental hospital in Shillong and was later shifted to Shillong Civil Hospital. Later he was admitted to Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Science after Salahuddins wife Hasina Ahmed demanded better treatment for her husband. Within 23 days of the arrest, Shillong Sub-Inspector M Lamhare submitted the charge sheet accusing Salahuddin only of trespassing. Two days later, a Shillong court granted Salahuddin conditional bail, making it mandatory for him to appear before the court every week. He was released from the hospital thereafter.",{},"['rs', 'long', 'doing', 'rent', 'guest', 'shillong', 'days', 'correspondent', 'rented', 'salahuddin', 'house']","Asked about how he was paying the rent, he refused to make any comment on anything while at the guest house on the ground of being under constant watch.

'And God Created the French' By Louis - Bernard Robitaille,"""IF we are to believe the longstanding legend, France has been resented ever since its birth.

All its European neighbours, to the north, to the east, even to the south, when they saw this new country in their midst, joined forces at once to pool their indignation and send emissaries before God to voice their complaints. To this single land, they said, God had granted everything: the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, the fertile plain and the proud mountains, the sun of the south and the melancholy mists of the north, cooking with butter and cooking with oil, the inexhaustible subtleties of the most wondrous vineyards in the world and the conviviality of a land where beer flows freely. Was this his idea of divine justice? God gave ear to this torrent of arguments and in his heart of hearts admitted that on this occasion, yes, he had been overly prodigal. So to make up for those unfair benefits and bounties... God created the French. And so the other Europeans went home, mollified. Justice had been done."" Robitaille adds, ""The anecdote may not be historically accurate."" Paris has always hosted writers - have been writers, would have been writers, will be writers and those chosen few writers whose writings sell. French-Canadian journalist, Louis-Bernard Robitaille happily falls into the latter category. With two books already published in Montreal and one novel published in Paris, Le Republique de Monte Carlo in 1990 - Robitaille achieved further success with the first English translation of his fourth book in 1997, ""Et Dieu Crea les Francais. The author has been for over twenty years the Paris correspondent for the Montreal daily newspaper La Presse and the bi-weekly newsmagazine LActualite. Pierre Salinger, the ardent Francophile American journalist and one-time press secretary to President John F Kennedy in a review of And God Created the French writes ""A biting, loving, and wonderfully knowledgeable insiders guide to Parisians. Few observers know France better than Robitaille."" Louis-Bernard Robitaille has been an intimate observer of Paris and of French society since the mid-sixties when he too, like countless others before him, sat the Cafe de Flore on the Left Bank. ""Dressed in a velvet suit and turtleneck, I sat myself down on the terrace of the Cafe de Flore, my left elbow lodged in one neighbours ribs, my right hand with about six inches leeway before it would capsize my other neighbours glass. I thought I spotted Francoise Sagan - which seemed perfectly normal, and a happy omen of events to come. Having ordered a coffee, I flipped open the notebook I had placed in front of me, and took out a pen. No sooner had I done so when a terrifying waiter, strapping and mustachioed, boomed out in a voice that could not be ignored: ""No writing on the terrace!"" No. Those bygone days are a things of the past; a bit of history down memory lane. At the Parisien cafes where literary success was achieved (one has to discount all those never made it); in the past, ""owners of such establishments... would have been flattered by such cultural consecration. On the contrary. They were appalled by the ensuing invasion of penniless scribblers from hither and yon, who threatened to monopolize indefinitely - in exchange for the modest price of a small espresso - a precious table that could bring in at the very least the price of a large beer every half-hour"". Alas no more wordsmiths in a Parisien cafe. Robitaille went on to write his first novel elsewhere in Paris in 1965-1966 ""whose only copy I lost in the gents at Heathrow airport the day I returned to Montreal."" Literary recognition finally came in 1982 with the publication of his first book. One should not come to Paris, the City of Wonder to dream? Is he joking? Robitaille jolts the reader with the line, ""But to come here to dream, no. Certainly one is taken aback, bewitched, overwhelmed at first by the beauty of Notre Dame or the quays of the Seine. But wait six months or a year, and the astonishment will have fled. Well, almost. Now and then when you least expect it youll be dazzled anew, on an autumn evening, say, as you cross over the Seine. What endures is the respect and admiration you feel for the Beauty and Perfection you behold as you try to recall, just as it was, that first sense of wonder, the colours and the smells"". Perhaps the writers inspiration, the Muse, Paris succumbs to two proverbs - Familiarity breeds contempt (doubtful) and Absence makes the heart grow fonder (undoubtedly). It was another Canadian, Sir Wilfred Laurier, Canadian Prime Minister, in an address in Paris, in 1897 who said ""My eyes do not grow weary in gazing at this Paris, so full of marvels; Paris the City of Light, as Victor Hugo called it with such truth, beyond dispute the most beautiful of all cities."" One of the enlightening bits of information Robitaille provide us is on the subject of French nobility titles - such as the commonly aristocratic de. The chapter is titled The de is not for burning. Even though noble privilege was abolished in France in 1789. ""An impressive number of people try each year to join the ranks, officially and administratively, of the vague dead letter which is all that remains of the French aristocracy"" In a matter of speaking I would add; since that vague de is yet sufficiently close to the hearts of many whereby ""nobility now caters only to the variety of those who seek it. But the usurper doesnt risk much either, just a snigger here and there. There is no dearth of candidates, therefore, for an expanded name. A French historian, Pierre Diudonnat has spent a quarter of a century listing the truly noble families and the bogus noble families. The 1994 edition of his Encyclopedia de la Fausse Noblesse et de la Nobless dApparence (The Encyclopedia of False or Ostensible Nobility) in some 669 pages, defrocks some 4000 names of dubious noble affiliation. Another myth shattered. In order to understand the French strata, Diudonnat reminds us that ""the de is not in itself an attribute of nobility. Many ancient noble families did not initially sport the particle, whereas it was found among some of the common folk. But it is true that, since for most people the two little letters were synonymous with aristocracy, nobles tended to affix them to the name of one of their fiefdoms. And families of the grand bourgeoisie followed suit to give themselves a semblance of nobility"". For our information, Charles de Gaulle ""was simply the issue of a very old bourgeois family, and we find as of 1720 a Jean-Baptiste de Gaulle who was prosecutor in the Parliament of Paris."" Further enlightenment on Parisien social makeup is provided for in Robitailles discussion of la bonne societe. He defines it as, ""a relatively unique French category, which groups, loosely speaking, the right crowd, the people who count in the media and the state, the defenders of culture, intelligence, refinement and reassuring good taste. This cultural bourgeoisie will be hereinafter referred to by its French name, i.e. la bonne societe."" And it is in the seventh arrondisement in which ""the heart of real Parisien society beats, and nowhere else; so much power linked to so much discretion commands respect."" The hallowed Golden Quadrilateral, a Forbidden City, includes the expanse covering the Rodin museum, any number of ministries, Les Invalides, Boulevard Montparnasse, rue Varennes, Rue de Grenelle and preserved facades hiding members of the Parisien establishment. The social hierarchy extends to the extent that ""The Parisian bonne societe may not lack for money, but neither does it consort with the moneyed.... Money exists, like bathtubs and toilets, but should not be shown off, nor publicly discussed. You may think about it all you want, just dont talk about it.... With a clear conscience one espouses what is worthy, cultivated, intelligent, enlightened, refined and reassuringly tasteful."" Yet, quartiers do evolve over the years - slowly. Barriers do become less defined. Robitaille remarks that ultimately, ""A neighborhood that yesterday was beneath contempt, today is declared chic by the arbiters of taste for the elite, and becomes acceptable. So goes the sociology of living space in Paris, and the price per square metre follows not far behind, at a moderate but constant speed."" We are in for a treat in his discussion of The Great Presidential Works (GPW) - which they certainly are - since they receive direct patronage of the president (as they once upon a time did under Louis XIV or Napoleon I). The GPWs include the Grand Louvre (See How to do the Louvre in Forty-five Minutes), DOrsay museum, Arab Institute, French National Library, the City of Science and Music and the Defense Grand Arch. The author asked one manager of the work site for Cite des Sciences et de la Musique about the difference between an ordinary project and a GPW. ""The response is classic in the French mode of expressiveness and expression. ""Ah! He replied, with feigned dismay, as though I had asked him to cite, off-the-cuff, the various proofs for the existence of God. ""Ah! You know, in such instances, there are no budgetary constraints."" He gestured vaguely, and sighed, as though he were contemplating the Infinite or the Great Void. ""There is, as it were, no budget at all."" A Thomas Bentley in Journal of a Visit to Paris all the way back in 1776 noted that ""The French have very magnificent ideas, and it is their delight to be laying magnificent plans. They begin work with a degree of vigour and expense that exhausts both their patience and their finances."" The innate sensitivity of the French to such national needs was apparent even then. So be it. Thus came about the Bastille Opera. President Mitterand and his Minister of Culture, Jacques Lang put forth a plan for a popular opera at the Place de la Bastille (the site of the popular uprising against the Bastille prison in 1789). Robitaille argues that, ""The seats are as expensive as they were at the old opera, the Palais-Garnier, and they are just as hard to get hold of for the major productions. It cost twice as much as what had been estimated...."" On the other hand, The Palais-Garnier, the mammoth classical opera house at the Place de I Opera, ""was one of the most beautiful opera houses in the world, with good acoustics, and it only needed a bit of modernization: it had 2,200 seats (20 per cent of which had an obstructed view) compared to 2,700 today at the Bastille not an enormous difference."" Lt. Col Nathaniel Newnham-Davis in ""The Gourmets Guide to Europe"" of 1903 wrote, ""An Englishman who loved his Paris beyond any other city of the world once said to me, as we stood chatting in the Place de IOpera, ""If you find the central spot of this square, you may rap your stick upon it and say ""This is the centre of the world."" I know about the obstructed view. In an umpteenth unsuccessful attempt to acquire proper seats for a ballet at the Palais-Garnier, I reluctantly agreed to buy tickets at 60 francs - a ridiculously low sum. On the ticket was printed partial visibility. Upon enquiring as to its meaning, I was informed that our vision of the performance of the Don Quixote ballet would be partial i.e. obstructed. Well, an obstructed view is better than no view - if one is ever to get into a masterpiece of nineteenth century architecture and see a prima ballerina perform. My husband unimpressed at my efforts declined to see a partial performance. I argued that at 60 francs, one could not lose. After all, we would see the interior, like a museum including what is acknowledged to be Charles Garniers landmark staircase; at worst, see half a ballet and at best, with eyes closed hear a full concert. My husband did not appreciate the bargain of my argument. He stayed. I went with our daughter and her friend. In an excellent expose on Paris - the heartbeat of France vis-a-vis the rest of the country - Robitaille finds that, ""the saga of Parisian centralism harks back uninterrupted to the ninth century AD., and that all the great men and key events in French history have contributed to it.... In France there are only two boxes in the ring; Paris in one corner, and in the other a huge anonymous mass referred to only in negative terms, as ""la province."" An Englishman, Sir William Clayton in his Journals 1861-1914, wrote that. ""The heart of France beats in Paris, and the excessive centralisation of the French has centered the hopes and ambitions in their capital."" A brilliant manifestation of this fundamental Parisien thinking is the decision to relocate Ecole Nationale dAdministration (ENA), the National Management School to Strasbourg close to the German border. ENA the bastion of Parisien establishment produces the French political leadership and Parisian bureaucrats. The national powerhouse opened in 1994 at its new address - en province. Yet, ""out of 26 months at school theyll spending seven in Strasbourg. That comes down to some boring return trips on the train and a few nights in a hotel. The ENA is now Strasbourg without ever having left Paris."" A magnificent compromise surely. Plus ca change, plus cest la meme chose? (The more it changes, the more it remains the same?) Robitaille here paraphrases Prince Salina in the Sicilian author, Guiseppe Lampedusas great novel, the epic, The Leopard; published in 1958 and later made into a film by Luschino Visconti. ""We must change everything so that nothing will change - a time-honoured teaching. The Economist magazine in an October 1998 issue, discussed The Leopard. To many readers, The Leopard is the greatest Italian novel this century perhaps the greatest ever and uniquely relevant to modern Italy."" (And elsewhere). The Economist quotes Lampedusas most famous line in the book, ""If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change."" Change within continuity. Mobility within immobility. Are these the ingredients, the motto for the durability and attraction of a city, a people, a nation? The author interviews a number of French celebrities. As the journalist remarks, ""Its an exercise that brings you face to face with the humbleness of your lot in life and the modesty of your profession."" He interviewed Isabelle Adjani, the Algerian-German born French actress and President of the Cannes Film Festival of 1997. The French have successfully overestimated the significance of a film festival. Only the French could make a social bonanza complete with starlets and paparazzi and give in an intellectual aura - a meaning, substance, social conscience - and money-making to boot. Remember the masterpiece Adele H by Francois Truffaut where she portrayed at eighteen the daughter of Victor Hugo? A much sought-after interview with the French music composer, Michel Legrand took place at Fouquets on the Champs Elysees at the suggestion of Legrands secretary. It went like this. ""Theres only one solution. ""You invite us to lunch on Wednesday. At Fouquets practical and its not expensive."" ""(In fact, its the most famous show-biz eatery on the Champs Elysees, and not the least expensive)."" Legrand composed the music for the 1964 cult film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg."" A seasoned journalist, Robitaille is starry-eyed in his interview with Catherine Deneuve, a star since the sixties. Can you blame him? He gushes, ""Deneuve the Immaculate. Catheine Deneuve is a consummate modern incarnation of French perfection..... Perfection, of course, of her features, with their steadfast limpidity. Its perfection that is never laboured, that is imbued with intelligence and culture. Perfection, above all, of her musical voice, which with a slight effortless inflection shifts from coldness to amusement, from polite indifference to animation, from spontaneous laughter to boredom. She says, just like that, ""Ah, you think so?, and you hear the angels sing."" A cover story on Catherine Deneuve in Le Figaro magazine is titled ""The Consecration of a Mythical Actress."" She is also named ""The New Idol of the Young."" A rap artist, a pure product of the 1990s, Stomy Bugsy in meeting Caterine Deneuve declares: ""My greatest dream was to meet her. That has been done.... a bomb of charm... Deneuve is a queen and I am nothing but her dArtagnan (her knight)."" Place Vendome, her latest film released in 1998 is takes place in the luxurious setting of Place Vendome in Paris, a coolly elegant square hosting top international jewellers. Deneuve plays an alcoholic. The film is set in the jewellery business. She has received accolades at the Venice Film Festival for her role in Place Vendome. Robitaille declares at the end of the interview, ""She has become, to all intents and purposes, the one star of French cinema, even if she finds the idea ""ridiculous. There are no stars in France."" Notwithstanding her statement, the epitomy of French beauty, the face of Catherine Deneuve graces the sculptured head adorning the Hotels de Ville (Town Halls) all over France. Fran Lebowitze in Metropolitan Life states, ""Paris is a great beauty. As such it possesses all the qualities that one finds in any other great beauty; chic, sexiness, grandeur, arrogance."" The same could be said of Catherine Deneuve.",{},"['deneuve', 'bernard', 'writers', 'god', 'louis', 'paris', 'place', 'la', 'film', 'created', 'robitaille', 'parisien', 'france', 'french']","So to make up for those unfair benefits and bounties...
