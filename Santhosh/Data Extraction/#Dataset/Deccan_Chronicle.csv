Alcoholics Anonymous: The helping hand for addicts,"This group is not a rehabilitation centre or an NGO, but just a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences.",,"May 3, 2016, 3:24 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it. Bengaluru: Sitting at one of the quiet corners of Stracey Memorial High School, a group of about thirty addicts gather late in the evenings to discuss one of the most debilitating issues of all ---alcoholism. What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it. ""I was the General Manager at a company until alcoholism gripped me and I was forced to leave the job,"" says 46-year-old Gnaneswar, who has not touched any alcohol for the past six years. ""I havent even taken a sip of beer in the last 6 years as I am completely out of it,"" says Gnaneswar, who is an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bangalore and helps other alcoholics get rid of this problem. This group is not a rehabilitation centre or an NGO, but just a fellowship of men and women who share their experiences, strength and hope with each other, so that they may solve their common problem and help others recover from alcoholism too. At the age of forty, Gnaneshwar became an alcoholic and was told to leave the house many times. ""For me back then alcohol was a religion and I would even lie to get things done my way. I would do it for money as well. All I cared about was drinking,"" says Gnaneswar. His addiction cost him his job, his family and his friends. ""I still remember the day when I was hospitalized and my father asked me to leave the house as he’d had enough. On the third day, a few people from this group met me and the rest is history!"" But he is not alone in the journey to get rid of this addiction. ""There are people who have not touched alcohol for thirty years and they help one another. But the first step is acceptance. “Only if the alcoholic accepts his condition will we include him into the group, where we dont charge anyone a single penny."" There are 72 centres across the city, which conduct sessions from 7 pm to 8 pm and each centre witnesses around 30 to 40 alcoholics. ""We have teenagers and senior citizens attending our sessions,"" says Gnaneswar. Every single alcoholic who has fully recovered tries to reach out to others as well.",Health and Wellbeing,"['addicts', 'anonymous', 'leave', 'turns', 'touched', 'hand', 'group', 'gnaneswar', 'alcoholics', 'drinking', 'alcoholism', 'alcoholic', 'alcohol', 'helping']","What begins as social drinking turns into alcoholism for many, but there are many who want to come out of it.

"The chat room: ‘Not prohibition, rehab is the answer to alcoholism’",Drinking is now a celebrated part of our culture and is an almost inextricable part of meeting,,"May 22, 2016, 5:53 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Last week, Samrat Chadha, one of the head honchos at the UB Group, drove his BMW into an autorickshaw, injuring three people. After hours of negotiation with the police, he was made to take an alcometer test, which proved positive. With drunken driving incidents like these on the rise - a number of them fatal - and more and more states taking to the idea of prohibition, is it time for Karnataka to follow suit? A counsellor for rehab inmates and long-time member of Alcoholics Anonymous rubbished the idea at once. Suresh (name changed) chose to remain anonymous, in keeping with the groups policy, but said, ""Thats quite stupid. The state would lose out on a lot of revenue. And the bottom line is that it would only hit the poor man. The rich, like Samrat Chadha, will not be affected by it at all. They know how to procure alcohol and can afford to pay for it."" Chadha, he said, exhibits definite signs of a drinking problem — ""He doesnt know his limits, clearly. This is the second stage of the disease, when the alcoholic begins blacking out. When they are under the influence, they have no idea what they are doing, lose their sense of judgment and dont remember it the next day."" Todays lifestyle, Suresh explained, has a big role to play in these incidents. Drinking is now a celebrated part of our culture and is an almost inextricable part of meeting ""social commitments."" Its up to the individual, he explained, to know his limits. The effects, of course, are mostly visible among the wealthier sections of society - ""A man who doesnt own a car will end up in a brawl on the streets or at home. The principle is the same, though. You dont know what youre doing and the next day, youre wondering what on earth happened."" Not everybody who drinks has a problem, of course and Alcoholics Anonymous has stats at the ready to back this. ""Out of a 100 people who drink, 10 are problem drinkers,"" Suresh said. ""Out of those ten, three will turn into alcoholics."" And its unfair to blame the condition on anybody else, he added. ""The blame game can go on and on - your boss fired you, so you drink. Your wife didnt listen to you, so guess what - you drank! Every alcoholic has a thousand excuses to have a drink and its upto him to come to terms with it."" Still, the fact that money is easy to come by these days has played a major role in the drinking culture we see today. ""Everyone can afford to go out for a drink - or three. Its a part of office life as well - corporate companies need to spread awareness among their employees. Alcohol is a fashion statement."" The onus cannot be lifted entirely from the government, even if prohibition is not the answer - ""I might be an A.A. member, but that doesnt mean Im against drinking,"" Suresh remarked, with a laugh. ""Still, the government can spread awareness and work with groups like A.A. - who will help for free, by the way. We need more stringent rules in place."" Getting caught for driving drunk means a fine, yes, but thats the end of that and it simply wont do. ""Every time a case of drunken driving or domestic abuse brought on by alcohol is reported in the station, cops should know what to do. Sending people to rehab or to A.A. meetings for a stipulated time period should become part of the system. Thats how things are done in the West and it works very well. But we, as a society, dont understand the meaning or the implications of alcoholism."" Far from recommending an A.A. meeting to a repeat offender, cops, he said, respond with, ""Did the wine shop invite these people to drink? Thats the kind of reaction we get, even though we dont charge any money for what we do."" Very little government funding goes into long term plans, Suresh added. ""You have departments like the Welfare Board, which dont do anything. Theyre just a farce and completely politically motivated. If a little bit of the money allocated to them was put to the use for which it was intended, society would come a long way.”",Current Affairs,"['know', 'room', 'society', 'problem', 'suresh', 'dont', 'answer', 'prohibition', 'drink', 'aa', 'chat', 'drinking', 'alcoholism', 'thats', 'money', 'rehab']","Chadha, he said, exhibits definite signs of a drinking problem — ""He doesn't know his limits, clearly.

Helping alcoholics kick the bottle!,Today Harsha is a happily married man and he calls himself a good son and a good father.,,"Aug 28, 2017, 1:23 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"BENGALURU: Despite measures being taken by several states to make the sale and consumption of alcohol illegal, reports suggest that it hardly impacts the alcoholics, as they find various ways to consume alcohol. With a vision to end the long term ramifications that alcohol has on the individual and the chain of relationships dependent on the individual, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a non-profit group of men and women, share their experiences in order to help others recover from the addiction. Anand, a member of the AA, terms alcoholism as a disease. He said, “People do not understand that it is a disease which can be compared to diabetes, where patients despite being advised to stay away from sugar would be tempted to consume it.” He adds that AA being a fellowship of men and women approach the alcoholic who wants to quit drinking, as only an alcoholic can understand the trauma of another alcoholic. While the de-addiction centre isolates the individual by keeping them in a protected area, AA volunteers aim to bring the alcoholics to the mainstream by the volunteers sharing their personal experiences. Harsha (name changed), one of the recovered members of AA, who quit alcohol consumption six years ago, shares his experience with Deccan Chronicle, “I was 21 when I was an alcoholic. It ultimately led to my isolation as nobody gave me respect. Despite having a good job I was paranoid,” he said. Today Harsha is a happily married man and he calls himself a good son and a good father. There are over 93 groups of AA in Bengaluru and meetings are conducted at schools and churches twice a week. Out of 2,500 members of AA, Anand said 705 are active members.",Viral and Trending,"['members', 'good', 'volunteers', 'individual', 'kick', 'aa', 'alcoholics', 'women', 'despite', 'alcoholic', 'alcohol', 'bottle', 'helping']","BENGALURU: Despite measures being taken by several states to make the sale and consumption of alcohol illegal, reports suggest that it hardly impacts the alcoholics, as they find various ways to consume alcohol.

"We are addicted to the absence of absence, says Pooja Bhatt","Actor-director Pooja Bhatt talks about dealing with alcoholism, her reasons for walking out of marriage and other life choices.",,"Apr 1, 2017, 12:23 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Power, determination and the unabashed guts to state a ‘spade a spade’ — actor-filmmaker-producer Pooja Bhatt is known for speaking the blunt reality of life. Whether it’s through her films like Dushman and Zakhm or her personal life, she did what she found right with conviction. In an interview, she spoke of the stigma of women alcoholism, walking out of marriage, having no children and more. Alcohol addition When you can ‘easily gulp half a bottle of single malt’ without feeling guilty, it’s time to pull the plug, states Pooja. “I have Scottish genes, my grandfather was Scottish. My father was a voracious drinker. So, drinking came naturally to me. It was Christmas when I finally decide to pull the plug. I sat with my four cats, put my phone on the silent mode, made myself dinner, toasted myself with a glass of water and went to bed,” shares the actress who was celebrating her 90 days of sobriety. She further adds, “I quit drinking because I thought somewhere I had fallen in that trap of addiction and the only way to get out of it was to acknowledge it to myself.” Societal stigma Pooja points out the societal stigma associated with women makes them brush things under the carpet. “I want to break the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because it’s a matter of shame for the family. We don’t share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer. Also, people put up this facade that they are under control by saying things like ‘It’s socially acceptable’, ‘I am not that drunk’,” she explains. “It’s the absence of absence we are addicted to. All of us are somewhere lonely and have different ways to cope with it — for some of us it’s alcohol that provides solace.” World — her AA group She didn’t need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as she had strong support systems, and speaking openly about the problem helped her overcome it. “To overcome any problem one must have to be real with themselves. I made the world my AA class. I have never been to any AA group meeting neither did I have a medical problem. It was just self-realisation that made me quit. I am 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which got watered down.” Today, Pooja has a fully stocked bar at home and even pours out drinks for friends and could sit through a party without having the urge to drink. “If I can’t be around alcohol and resist it, it means I’m not in control. Each day strengthens my resolve as I realise I have more hours to a day now. Even when I drank till 4 am, I’d be at work at 10 am but I was burning myself out. Today, I feel lighter with the excess water gone. All the drama alcohol brings is eliminated from my life,” she says. Talking about her biggest achievement so far, she says, “When some of my female friends call me asking for help and advice to overcome their addiction, I feel very good. Though, I am not qualified but I give them motivation to face each day as it comes. I do not believe in having a long-term plan.” Ending her marriage Two years ago, Pooja ended her marriage of 12 years. “People did not even think that we could survive a few months together but we were together for 12 successful years. We promised each other that we would never look over each other’s shoulder and live a lie. We didn’t have children which made it easier for us. One of the prime reasons for ending the marriage was that in the process of being a responsible wife, producer and production designer, I forgot and left the girl in me far behind. People do ask me, ‘Oh, you left your 12 years of marriage to find yourself’. Yes, that bloody well is the reason I left. Not for somebody else or a comfortable life, I gave all that up for being fiercely single and living the life on my own terms.” Having children At one point in her life, she wanted to have six children. “Today, science has advanced to the extent that I could have children whenever I want. Do I want to opt for surrogacy? I do not. At present I do not have any such plans but if I feel like that in future, I might have a child of my own. I am sorry if I am going to disappoint women who feel that becoming a mother completes you. I don’t feel I am any less of a woman for not having a child. I do not think any woman in the world should feel that way. It’s a personal choice. Why me syndrome “We all go through a phase when we think that why everything bad is happening. I don’t believe in feeling victimised, instead I like facing it on. Would I like to change a few things in life, Yes! But at the end of the day, mistakes are the dues you get to have a full life. And remember it’s a fact that bad thing happens to good people and good things always happen to good people. So, you need to get passed it and me true to yourself,” she states.",Bollywood,"['life', 'having', 'good', 'absence', 'day', 'addicted', 'children', 'marriage', 'bhatt', 'women', 'pooja', 'feel', 'things']","Power, determination and the unabashed guts to state a ‘spade a spade’ — actor-filmmaker-producer Pooja Bhatt is known for speaking the blunt reality of life.

Prayers can help us resist urge to booze: study,Prayer stimulates the parts of the brain that are responsible for attention and emotion.,,"May 8, 2016, 10:41 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Researchers found that a craving for alcohol could be tempered by the power of prayer. (Photo: Pixabay) Washington D.C.: When the urge to booze hits you, turn to God, suggests a new study. After working with longstanding members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the New York University researchers found that a craving for alcohol could be tempered by the power of prayer. According to them, prayer stimulates the parts of the brain that are responsible for attention and emotion. The participants, who were first shown a series of images considered to induce alcohol cravings, reported less desire to drink after they recited a prayer. Senior author Marc Galanter, Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at the university, said the experience of going to AA had left some people with an ""innate ability"" to use prayer to minimise the effect of alcohol triggers. Craving is diminished in long-term AA members compared to patients who have stopped drinking for some period of time but are more vulnerable to relapse, he added. ""Our current findings open up a new field of inquiry into physiologic changes that may accompany spiritual awakening and perspective changes in AA members and others,"" said Dr Galanter.

Binge drinking dramatically ups mortality rate,The new study also showed social risks of drinking,,"Apr 30, 2015, 12:37 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Hangovers are inevitable when it comes to New Year celebrations, heres how you can banish them. Washington: A new study has provided a link between drinking behaviors with the overall mortality rate. A new University of Colorado Boulder study involving some 40,000 people indicates that social and psychological problems caused by drinking generally trump physically hazardous drinking behaviors when it comes to overall mortality rates. The study showed, for instance, that participants who had experienced an intervention by physicians, family members or friends had a 67 percent greater risk of death over the 18-year study period, said sociology Professor Richard Rogers, lead study author. Those who reported cutting down on social or sports activities because of alcohol use had a 46 percent higher risk of death over the same period. In contrast, issues like driving after drinking too much or engaging in other physically risky behaviors did not result in a significant uptick in mortality rates. The new study also showed social risks of drinking, from losing jobs to having spouses threaten to leave, were equally or more strongly linked to mortality than physiological consequences of alcohol abuse like withdrawal jitters or becoming physically ill. One of the most unexpected findings was that of those who identified themselves as light drinkers, consuming less than one drink a day, 48 percent reported having some problem with alcohol in the 12 months prior to the survey. The research data allowed the CU-Boulder team to investigate the mortality associated with 41 separate drinking problems including drinking more than intended, unsuccessfully trying to cut back, driving a car after drinking too much, losing ties with friends and family, missing work with hangovers, drinking more to get the same effect, depression and arrests. It was also found that 23 percent started drinking without intending to, 20 percent drank longer than expected and 25 percent experienced a strong urge to drink. For those who experienced a strong urge to drink over the past year, 19 percent were light drinkers, 40 percent were moderate drinkers and 57 percent were heavy drinkers. Current drinkers who found it difficult to stop once they started had a 15 percent higher risk of death over the follow-up period; those who acknowledged going on a drinking bender during the past 12 months had a 54 percent higher mortality rate; and those who blacked out during the previous 12 months prior to the assessment had a 22 percent higher mortality rate over the 18-year study period. The new study also showed those who reported attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in the past year had a 45 percent higher risk of mortality. But those results likely are somewhat misleading in that some of those people could have recently have been diagnosed as alcoholics or were more likely to have severe health, social or legal problems, including required AA attendance. In addition, those who reported attending AA might have had increased risk of mortality due to smoking or may have had other substance abuse problems. The study is published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence.",Lifestyle,"['study', 'drinkers', 'dramatically', 'social', 'mortality', 'showed', 'higher', 'binge', 'rate', 'risk', 'drinking', 'ups', 'alcohol', 'reported']","Washington: A new study has provided a link between drinking behaviors with the overall mortality rate.

"Is sex addiction real, a crime, or made-up to deflect blame?","When sex addiction contributes to criminal behavior, rehab could bolster a defense attorneyâs argument that the accused has changed.",,"Dec 5, 2017, 5:10 pm IST",Deccan Chronicle,"When sex addiction contributes to criminal behavior, rehab could bolster a defense attorney’s argument that the accused has changed. (Photo: Pixabay) Is sex addiction a true addiction, a crime, or a made-up condition used by misbehaving VIPs to deflect blame or repair tarnished images? A tide of high-profile sexual misconduct accusations against celebrities, politicians and media members has raised these questions — and sowed confusion. Sex addiction is not an officially recognized psychiatric diagnosis, though even those who doubt it’s a true addiction acknowledge that compulsive sexual behavior can upend lives. Either way, there is an important distinction, sometimes blurred, between a mental condition and a crime. Some men who have been accused of assault or other sexual crimes have sought treatment for sex addiction or other unspecified conditions. But compulsive behavior is very different from a crime, and the vast majority of people who suffer from sexually compulsive behavior do not harass or assault others. There’s “an extremely fine line between addict and offender” and sometimes the two overlap, said psychologist Leah Claire Bennett of Pine Grove Behavioral Health & Addiction Services, a rehab center that offers sex addiction treatment in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Despite pressure from some therapists, sex addiction was not included in the most recent edition of the manual that psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illness. “The reason is very simple,” said Dr. Charles O’Brien, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatry professor involved in the manual’s 2013 update. There is no rigorous scientific proof that compulsive sexual behavior affects the brain in the same ways that have been shown with addiction to drugs or alcohol, he said. “There’s an overuse of the word ’addiction,’” O’Brien said. “There are many treatment programs. That doesn’t make it a disorder.” Still, some skeptics don’t dispute that compulsive sexual behavior can become a serious problem. The issue for some is whether it amounts to mental illness, or whether it might result from a different psychiatric condition, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Robert Weiss, a California-based sex addiction therapist, said the condition involves unrestrained compulsive sexual behavior without regard to consequences. Sometimes that leads to illegal behavior. The International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals says sex addiction affects from 2 percent to 5 percent of the general population but that only 10 percent of those with this addiction engage in criminal sexual behavior. Most patients and sex offenders are men. Some treatment programs won’t admit patients accused of rape and other violent sex crimes, referring them to centers or therapists who specialize in treating sex offenders. Addiction treatment at Pine Grove, The Meadows in Arizona and other high-profile residential rehab centers can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Despite country club-like settings, there’s nothing cushy or indulgent about sex addiction therapy, Weiss said. Pine Grove requires daylong sessions including group therapy daily for up to three months. Some centers use 12-step programs similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, but they don’t require swearing off sex for good. Some use brain “retraining” exercises, or sharing stories about bad behavior with a roomful of strangers. Some centers use equine therapy. Weiss says that interacting with horses can help patients recognize problems sometimes associated with sex addiction, including overly aggressive, controlling behavior. The New York Post published a photograph last year that it said showed former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner riding a horse as part of treatment at a Tennessee sex addiction rehab center. Weiner was sentenced in September for sexting with a teenager. He said at the time that he was undergoing therapy and had been “a very sick man for a very long time.” Weiss and other therapists say sex addicts are never cured, but they can learn to manage their behavior and avoid triggers, including avoiding jobs and circumstances that could lead to a repeat of problem behavior. L.J. Schwartz, a former real estate adviser in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, says a nearly 30-year addiction to sex almost ruined his life. Schwartz says his addiction included having sex with strangers at adult bookstores or masturbating there while watching porn nearly every chance he got; working as a stripper and phone sex. He was never arrested but says his behavior endangered his job and marriage. “There’s no pleasure derived from sex addiction; it’s pain,” Schwartz said. He says a 12-step program helped him resist his compulsions and he now works as a recovery coach for other patients. But hard evidence that treatment works is lacking. “There’s not a lot of data,” Bennett acknowledged. “We have a lot of anecdotal evidence. We can see the change in people,” she said. She said Pine Grove plans a long-term study to measure the benefits. Whether treatment can repair tarnished images is uncertain. “The accusations levied against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K. and others for sexual assault, harassment and abuse have created righteous outrage and concerns that ‘sex addiction treatment’ is being used to excuse their offensive behavior,” the addiction professionals institute said in a recent statement. Whether any of these men have a diagnosed mental condition has not been publicized. A representative for Weinstein confirmed that he is receiving treatment and has been taking his recovery and sessions seriously. But the representative declined to specify Weinstein’s condition or the treatment he is receiving for it. A former publicist for Spacey said he also is seeking unspecified treatment. Bennett said some people do use sex addiction as an excuse, “but that’s not who we’re treating here at Pine Grove. These peoples’ lives are in shambles. They’ve been traumatized throughout their lives. They have huge psychological wounds and are using very maladaptive ways of coping.” Actor David Duchovny voluntarily sought rehab for sex addiction in 2008 while starring on Showtime’s “Californication.” Married to actress Tea Leoni at the time, he had been dogged by cheating rumors. His career never stalled. He returned to “Californication” for the remainder of its run and has continued to appear in high-profile roles. When sex addiction may have contributed to criminal behavior, a trip to rehab could bolster a defense attorney’s argument that the accused person has changed, said Samuel Pillsbury, a professor at Loyola School of Law in Los Angeles. But it’s a less effective strategy for violent crimes, he said. “It’s very difficult for me to imagine a prosecutor deciding, ‘Oh, he’s in rehab, I’ll drop the charges or I’ll reduce the charges significantly,’” Pillsbury said. “But it could have an effect on sentencing.”",Sex and Relationship,"['addiction', 'real', 'crime', 'compulsive', 'sexual', 'sex', 'deflect', 'blame', 'treatment', 'madeup', 'grove', 'condition', 'behavior', 'therapy', 'rehab']","When sex addiction contributes to criminal behavior, rehab could bolster a defense attorney’s argument that the accused has changed.

Dev 360: Method and the madness,Maharaj has effortlessly morphed into a story the media loves,,"Jan 15, 2015, 6:45 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"It is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Enid Blyton moment. Instead of the mystery of the disappearing cat or the missing necklace, we have the gripping mystery of the missing show cause notice. Habitually controversial BJP MP Swami Sacchidanand Hari, better known as Sakshi Maharaj, kicked off 2015 by asking Hindu women to have at least four children to expand the flock. Predictably, furore has followed. Sakshi Maharaj is now the staple of prime time television. Not that the member of Parliament from Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, is the only one who views the Hindu woman’s womb as part of a national project. But as an MP from the ruling party opposing the government’s avowed goal of reducing the total fertility rate (TFR) the average number of children born to a woman from the current 2.3 to 2.1 by 2017, Maharaj has effortlessly morphed into a story the media loves. An embarrassed BJP high command says it has served the MP a show-cause notice, asking him to explain why action should not be initiated against him for his controversial remarks in the recent past. Maharaj is supposed to respond within 10 days. This has prompted the media to chorus that the BJP leadership is finally cracking down on the delinquents in the party. But is that what it is? Just how low is the cost of making outlandish statements in Indian politics can be gauged by Maharaj’s insouciance in the face of such action. At the time of writing this column, the MP was breezily telling reporters that he had no information of any notice and that it was an “internal matter” of the BJP, nothing at all to do with the media. Is such a notice likely to reform Sakshi Maharaj? I doubt it. As many would remember, not so long ago, the same man started a row by describing Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse as a “patriot” and was forced to apologise in Parliament. Those with longer memories or inclined to Google search would also know that in 2006, the Rajya Sabha unanimously adopted the recommendation of the eighth report of the House Ethics Committee for expulsion of Sakshi Maharaj, then a member of the Samajwadi Party. He had featured in a sting operation by a TV channel on the misuse of MP Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). Buoyed by Maharaj’s breeziness towards show-cause notices, in West Bengal Birbhum BJP joint district president Shymal Goswami has also taken to advising Hindu women on how many children they should have. On January 12, while observing the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda at a school, Mr Goswami said Hindu women needed to have five children to counter supposed demographic challenges from minority communities. In the season of competitive absurdities that has become the hallmark of much of the public discourse in the country, Ramesh Tawadkar, minister of sports and youth affairs in Goa, has also become an international celebrity after a local television channel showed him as saying he would set up centres to make gays and lesbians “normal”. He had details too the centres would be modelled on the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous. Predictably commotion has broken out and Mr Tawadkar now says he was misunderstood. Goa’s chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar has had to personally clear the air by emphatically stating that Goa has no intentions of doing any such thing. Anyone who watched the video footage of the interview would wonder if the reporter was trying to bait Mr Tawadkar by asking how he planned to make lesbians and gays “normal”. Nothing, however, excuses the phenomenally daft response, smacking of ignorance and prejudice. Outlandish statements are not new. The political landscape is riddled with luminaries in every party whose words and deeds are jaw-droppingly bewildering. You can call them the lunatic fringe. But many are in responsible positions. Madhya Pradesh home minister Babulal Gaur once said rape is a “social crime which depends on the man and the woman. It is sometimes right and sometimes wrong.” BJP politicians don’t have a monopoly on bizarre and outrageous statements. Who can forget home minister in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, and Congress gaffe minister Sushil Kumar Shinde? In his reply to a debate on Assam riots in the Lok Sabha in 2012, Mr Shinde used the word “terrorist” instead of “territorial” for Bodoland Territorial Administration District (BTAD) triggering much mirth in the Opposition benches. Ajit Pawar, former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra and Nationalist Congress Party leader, famously said, “Should we urinate in dams?” by way of response to a hungerstrike by drought-affected farmers demanding release of dam water. Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi once said that any woman who has sex before marriage should be hanged. Which brings one to the key question is there an ongoing contest for making the most bizarre statements or is there something more to it than meets the eye? In a country with the second-highest population in the world, where millions of women do not have access to basic healthcare, including reproductive health, and which has one of the highest numbers of maternal and newborn deaths, how are representatives of the ruling party exhorting women to produce more babies? Can a minister for youth affairs afford to be so staggeringly ignorant about the reality of LGBT (lesbians, gays, bisexuals and trans-genders)? Can a man tasked to oversee law and order be allowed to be brazenly crass on something as sensitive as rape? Many commentators have been demanding that all political parties, starting with the one in power, crush the chorus of crazies amidst them. Here, the question that must be asked is, are they really crazy? What if it is a game aimed at adversaries in order to throw them off balance and divert public attention from discussions of other more pressing issues? International relations experts call it “trash talking.” One of its most brilliant exponents was former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The image of Mr Ahmadinejad as portrayed in mainstream media was that of a leader who is unhinged from reality. But, as commentator Kristen Livingston pointed out in a piece in the Journal of Public Diplomacy, this is what we get when we focus on his rhetoric. Instead, the focus should have been on not what he said, but what he had not said. Going by the ceaseless drip-drip of outrageous statements, one is tempted to think that the lunatic fringe in this country too is not as mad as made out to be. Or rather there is a method in madness.

Wine testing drive in Coorg after tourist’s complaint,Coorg district excise department officials have launched a massive wine-testing drive in the district,,"Jul 7, 2015, 10:01 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Bengaluru: Plan to enjoy this monsoon at Coorg? Think twice before buying the locally made wine! Based on a complaint lodged by an anonymous tourist from Bengaluru city, Coorg district excise department officials have launched a massive wine-testing drive in the district. The complaint was routed through the district tourism department. It all started with a city tourist distributing home-made wines brought from Coorg to his friends in the city. According to this anonymous petitioner, immediately after consuming the wine, his friends fell ill. Attributing the cause of illness to the wine, he lodged a complaint with the Coorg tourism department, who in turn forwarded the complaint to the excise department which started a massive inspection drive across the district. Sources say, the reason for the illness was a high alcoholic content. Confirming the developments, Coorg district Dy Commissioner of Excise Mr. Aziz Ahmed said that the department is trying to find the brand of wine which had the excess alcoholic content. “We are collecting the samples. The petitioner did not give us the exact details of the brand which caused the illness. The state government has fixed a maximum for the alcoholic content in wines. If we find a wine brand which has exceeded the limit for alcohol content, action will be initiated,” he said.

Got 'Drunchies'? That's why you're packing on the pounds,Drunchies are the munchies you get after drinking alcohol. Drinking five beers a day accounts for third of your daily energy intake.,,"Aug 9, 2018, 3:20 pm IST",Deccan Chronicle,"If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. (Representational Image) Drunchies, or the desire to eat salty, unhealthy foods after a night of heavy drinking, may be contributing to the obesity epidemic among college students, scientists say. Researchers from University at Buffalo in the US decided to look at a sample of 286 college students to better understand how drinking affects what they eat, both that night and for their first meal the next day when, most likely, they are hungover. ""Given the obesity epidemic and the rates of alcohol consumption on college campuses, we need to be aware of not only the negative effect of alcohol consumption, but also the impact it has on what people are eating while they are drinking,"" said Jessica Kruger, an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo. Research on the effects of drinking and diet is scarce, Kruger said, adding that eating more unhealthy foods following alcohol consumption is an often overlooked behaviour in traditional addiction research. The inspiration for the study, published in the Californian Journal of Health Promotion, came from an ad researchers saw in a university newspaper. ""It said, Got Drunchies? and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said. An average beer contains 150 calories. If a person drinks five beers, it accounts for third of their daily energy intake. Add two slices of pizza or a burrito to that at the end of the night, and its a recipe for weight gain, she said. ""So, we dug a bit deeper and first figured out what the drunchies were, and then decided this would be interesting to study,"" Kruger said. Study participants were asked to complete an anonymous online survey. Researchers found that drinking influenced study participants dietary behaviours before going to bed. All alcohol drinkers were more likely to eat something before they went to bed after drinking alcohol than in general before they go to bed. Specifically, they were more likely to opt for salty snack foods and pizza. Healthy foods, such as dark green vegetables and other veggies they would ordinarily eat, were not as appealing. Of particular concern, the researchers noted, was the fact that participants did not report drinking more water or other non-alcoholic beverages before bed. That exacerbates dehydration, which may lead to additionally unhealthy food choices. The following day after drinking, participants dietary patterns varied from the night before. They were less likely to skip meals the morning after a night of drinking compared to a typical morning. They favoured foods like pizza or tacos over milk and dairy products and grains, most likely because of the so-called hangover cures that get passed down to students and which entail eating foods that ""soak up"" the alcohol. Dispelling these myths is one way to promote a healthy diet even after a night of binge drinking, Kruger said.",Health and Wellbeing,"['night', 'drunchies', 'kruger', 'pizza', 'participants', 'youre', 'likely', 'university', 'alcohol', 'drinking', 'packing', 'eat', 'thats', 'foods', 'pounds']","and had ads for pizza, tacos, and other fast-food places that were open late after the bars closed,"" Kruger said.

Problem drinking starts before military deployment,Screening for alcohol abuse before deployment could allow people to be identified and helped earlier.,,"May 8, 2016, 11:57 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Just under 39 percent of the sailors and marines reported hazardous drinking before deployment, a study says. (Photo: Pixabay) Binge drinking and alcoholism is a big issue in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and the problem may begin even before sailors and marines deploy, a recent study suggests. More than a quarter of sailors and marines who were anonymously surveyed within two weeks before their deployment admitted to binge drinking regularly, and nearly 40 percent reported dangerous drinking. A small but significant number also reported that they had been drugged against their will. Previous research has focused on the drinking habits of military personnel while deployed or after returning home. Little is known about drinking in the period before reporting for duty, the researchers write in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. That period could be a time of higher stress and people may drink more because they will not be able to drink while aboard ship, the researchers write. “This is a time of major transition away from family, friends and important social support networks,” said coauthor Dr. Braden Hale, program manager at the Department of Defense’s HIV/AIDS Prevention Program. Hale told Reuters Health by email that screening for alcohol abuse before deployment could allow people to be identified and helped earlier. The study team used data on 2,351 male and female shipboard personnel collected between 2012 and 2014. Participants gave anonymous reports about hazardous drinking, including how often they drank and how often they had more than six drinks at a time. They also answered questions about alcohol dependency, including physical cravings for it, and binge drinking, defined as having more than four drinks for women and more than five for men during a typical day of drinking. The researchers also asked if participants had ever been “roofied,” or had their drinks spiked. Overall, 79 percent of the subjects were men and around 85 percent were in the Navy. Just over 12 percent were under the age of 21. Just under 39 percent of the sailors and marines reported hazardous drinking before deployment. This was significantly higher for men, at 40 percent, than for women, at 34 percent. Thirty-six percent of those under age 21 had engaged in hazardous drinking. Twenty-seven percent reported binge drinking. This too was more common for men, at nearly 30 percent, than for women, at 20 percent. Overall, close to 15 percent were dependent on alcohol: nearly 17 percent of men and 7 percent of women. Personnel between the ages of 17 and 20 were more likely to report being dependent on alcohol. Few of the sailors and marines reported taking recreational drugs, but 7 percent had been given a drug against their will. The percentages were about equal between men and women. “These findings confirm there is a culture of drinking, including underage drinking, among Marines and Navy members that needs to be addressed,” said Mary Jo Larson, a senior scientist at Brandeis University’s Institute for Behavioral Health who studies military drinking. “The consequences include injuries, fights, car crashes and unwanted sexual contact, including rape,” said Larson, who was not involved in the study. Larson noted that commanding officers are notified when service members seek treatment for drinking, which may discourage people who need help from seeking it. “The take away is that the Navy and Marines must establish additional effective prevention programs, which send a strong message that those that need medical help can receive it confidentially,” she said by email. In order to prevent short- and long-term harms from alcohol abuse, Hale calls for “screening, intervention and care before deployment for shipboard personnel who may be engaging in hazardous or dependent alcohol use.”",Health and Wellbeing,"['problem', 'hazardous', 'military', 'starts', 'marines', 'personnel', 'deployment', 'drinking', 'men', 'alcohol', 'reported', 'sailors', 'women']","Just under 39 percent of the sailors and marines reported hazardous drinking before deployment, a study says.

"Healthy X’mas yums Bakey, Beku","This festive season, many bakers are offering low cal treats...",,"Dec 13, 2018, 12:06 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"The mention of Christmas reminds one of all the gifts, decorations, sparkles and yums! About baking cakes, cookies, snacks and chocolates. From the days leading to Christmas to long after, many binge on delicious rose cookies, tassies, kal-kals, logs, marzipan and more that grandmas and mums make from scratch, and today the friendly neighbourhood baker is up for the task. But as yummy as this festive feasting is, all these are high on sugar and fat, leaving many perplexed about how they will curb the urge to gorge away. Sugar, refined flour, butter and chocolate — health buffs are already getting sleepless nights. The city has the perfect answer — This Christmas season, city bakers are are offering healthy goodies using a variety of natural ingredients like honey, jaggery, nut flours, seeds, oats, etc, so you can eat without guilt. Chaitali Raizada, a city-based baker has two versions of the classic plum cake — the alcoholic and the fruity one (soaked in natural juices). She says, “The dry fruits for the non-alcoholic cake are cooked in fruit rind, juice and jaggery. I don’t trust store-bought flour. For my cakes, I use in-house milled almond flour. For those with a nut allergy, we use oat flour. I also do vegan cakes, and use cooking olive oil.” City-based baker Trishala Ashok has many goodies being baked in her oven. “Every Christmas, we play Secret Santa and people send anonymous goodie boxes to loved ones. These are low-cal and healthy. This time, I will be making oat chocochip cookies, peanut butter truffles and ragi brownies. I have substituted white or brown sugar with jaggery and honey instead of artificial sweeteners,” says Trishala. Arati Badgandi, a city-based doctor does not have time to workout, so eating right is very important to her. This festive season, she has opted for low cal goodies to keep a check on what she eats. She adds, “Healthy and low cal is the trend now. I have bought a lot of dark chocolate ragi brownies frosted with peanut butter, oatmeal and strawberry cupcakes. The surprising thing is that even though they are made unconventionally, they are still moist and taste good,” she says. For Shruthi SA, who is known for her granola bars and chocolates, the agenda is simple, “I make a lot of granola bars, nutcrackers and healthy chocolates. Cinnamon and cloves are spices that are perfect for the festive season. Keeping this in mind, this time, we are making dark chocolate barks. I have used a lot of nuts and seeds and also chia, flax seeds and millet. So if you were to eat a 40 gm granola bar, your calorie intake would be close to 120 cal.” Nutritionist Dr Aruna Vijay elaborates on this endless tussle about eating yums or going healthy, “It’s definitely going to be low calorie if natural substitutes are used. But it also depends on how they make it low cal. For example, if sugar is substituted with jaggery or honey then it’s definitely welcome. If they are going to use artificial sweeteners then that is a big no-no. We all know how our body reacts to chemicals. People who want to indulge in these low cal goodies should go ahead, and let go of a meal rather than eating it along with their three meals a day. Even the low calorie and healthy snacks should be used in moderation. They can have it for a day, and then go healthy from the next day.”",Viral and Trending,"['cal', 'christmas', 'seeds', 'used', 'bakey', 'yums', 'goodies', 'beku', 'xmas', 'low', 'sugar', 'flour', 'jaggery', 'healthy']","This festive season, she has opted for low cal goodies to keep a check on what she eats.

Tornado that laid patriarchy bare,"Lone voices over the years that swelled to an avalanche of testimonies, built #MeToo into the annihilating force it is today.",,"Dec 30, 2018, 12:16 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Before every big, chaotic wave of #MeToo, there was a solitary “Me”. Singular. Alone. Brave. “Me” was not held together by a supportive hashtag at one end and a sweet, pink emoji at the other. “Me” meant mustering courage that overwhelms and makes you tremble a little. “Me” meant deciding to stand up, and then raising your hand to point a finger at a boss, a mentor, a colleague, a teacher. “Me” meant claiming a moment in the world for yourself, to break your silence, to tell your story. LONE VOICES For Tanushree Dutta to unleash the second wave of #MeToo in India in September 2018, Lisa Rundle had stood up alone in Canada in 2010 to accuse her boss at Penguin, David Davidar, of inappropriate text messages, stalking and forcing his tongue into her mouth. Three years before Vinta Nanda took to Facebook to talk of how the sanskari Alok Nath had raped her, a young employee of Phantom Films had accused Vikas Bahl, the director of Queen, of masturbating on her. Years before journalist Priya Ramani accused M.J. Akbar, a former editor and till recently junior foreign minister, of inappropriate behaviour, a young journalist from Tehelka had accused Tarun Tejpal, her editor, of sexual assault, and the organisation of conspiring to “deal” with the matter quietly. Before journalist Ghazala Wahab wrote a gut-wrenching account of being molested, repeatedly, by Akbar, there was Ruchika Girhotra, all of 14, taking on the might of inspector general of police S.P.S. Rathore in 1990, and paying for it with her life. Exactly a year before the 2018 tide of #MeToo hit India, forcing Akbar to step down, Phantom Films to unravel, Alok Nath to get his wife to file a defamation case against Nanda, an Indian law student in the US, Raya Sarkar, had compiled a list of sexual harassers, molesters, creeps in academia so that the women who came after would know whom to avoid, how to navigate. That 2017 spread-sheet, in which women known only to Sarkar had accused 73 men of sexual harassment, was the first wave of #MeToo in India — an act of “civil disobedience” born out of frustration at the systemic failure to protect women. It drew power and legitimacy from the 87 women, including Ashley Judd, Heather Graham, Daryl Hannah, Salma Hayek, Anjolina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, who had called out Harvey Weinstein, the Miramax boss with six best picture Oscars, in the US. THE SECOND WAVE In just a year, all these women empowered the second wave of #MeToo in India which has been less a gentle ripple, and more a crackling, wild bonfire of vanities. #MeToo was now a concerted campaign against sexual abuse and the culture of impunity. From the anonymous, often one-word accusations on Sarkar’s spread-sheet, women were now telling their stories in all its gory, traumatising detail — about how men they trusted and worked with had violated and sexually assaulted them. If there was any shame, it was piled on the perpetrator. It singed Bollywood, the art world, journalism, stand-up comedy, BCCI, politics... Many names that came out were not surprising — Akbar, Alok Nath, Sajid Khan, Suhel Seth — to those who knew or had worked with them. Others were shocking. Rajat Kapoor, Kiran Nagarkar, Chetan Bhagat, Vinod Dua… But there was no stopping #MeToo. The slogan that American activist Tarana Burke coined in 2006 had become a rallying cry, a baton that women were taking from one, carrying for a bit, and then handing over to another. MASKS CRUMBLE Overnight the carefully constructed public personas of several powerful men, their fiercely guarded reputations and liberal veneer cracked and then crashed to the ground, exposing them for the creeps and criminals they were. The formidable editor and minister was now seen as a deviant who liked to welcome young women in his hotel room wearing a bathrobe, or just his unseemly briefs. A lecture from him on women’s empowerment would now forever be unpalatable. The actor who embodied all that was pious and precious about the great Indian happy family was now known as an alcoholic and a serial molester. Suhel Seth, the man perennially on screechy news channels heaping insults, was now the creep who groped women and shoved his hand down their tops. The patriarchal edifice trembled a bit more when #MeToo hit the corporate world. Rahul Johri, CEO of BCCI, was called out. And then, Jammu & Kashmir DSP Shashi Thakur levelled allegations of sexual harassment at former additional director general of police, Alok Puri. CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE BROKEN Women breaking their silence, in some cases after decades, has been momentous, cathartic, troubling, profound. Finding their voice and reclaiming some power has led to relief at no longer being complicit in protecting men who violated them. The response in certain cases has been gratifying. In some professional spaces it has led to holding men to account for their behaviour, and some redistribution of power. In Sweden, a sexual harassment scandal has claimed the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature. In several organisations in India, inquiries by internal complaints committees (ICC) were initiated. In some instances men were asked to step down, film directors were dropped, film projects abandoned. Vinta Nanda, who is just about coming out of the #MeToo whirlpool to catch her breath, says that since she was not brought up by her parents to stay quiet, speaking out has relieved her of the burden of silence. Nanda says that what happened to her was at a party where she had had a few drinks, and was helpless. “Yet, after that I went from pillar to post telling my story. In 2004-5, my account was printed on the front page of a leading newspaper, everyone read it, yet there was silence.” She says that the world at that time was not ready to listen. That there was a conspiracy of silence. “There’s not a single soul in the industry who doesn’t know the Jekyll & Hyde that is Alok Nath. Everyone has always known what kind of a predator he is. Yet no one said anything. They were all pretending like nothing had happened”. The reason Nanda decided to write her Facebook post in October, she says, was because “I just knew that I had support from this younger generation — who are fearless, anarchist. They helped me find my voice again.” Dutta and Nanda in turn empowered others to speak up — about producer Gaurang Doshi, directors Sajid Khan, Rajat Kapoor, Dibakar Banerjee, Subhash Ghai, Vivek Agnihotri, singers Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Kailash Kher, Raghu Dixit, music director/singer Anu Malik, lyricist Vairamuthu, talent manager Anirban Blah, casting director Mukesh Chhabra… THE GREY AREAS Then came the messy #MeToo accounts, where seemingly there was consent. Despite the power equation, from outside, and often even to the perpetrator and the victim, these looked like consensual affairs. These accounts probed and challenged the concept of consent further. Amrita Narayanan, a clinical psychologist and author who has edited an anthology of Indian writing on erotica, The Parrots of Desire, says that sexual harassment has very little to do with sex or sexual desire. “It’s about wielding power. In mutual sex, there’s desire and affection. But pathological sexually harassers have no concept of the other person, of the women. In their sexual arena, it’s all about owning, exhibiting and exerting power — and because they don’t see the other, because they see the women as objects and themselves as the only subject, harassers talk of consent, consensual relations,” Narayanan said. Thankfully, the reaction of men who have been accused of sexual harassment has not been homogenous. Some have understood, empathised, apologised and taken a step back. “But for men whose fragile masculine identity is built on power and the power of manipulation, #MeToo is scary, it’s very bad news… It’ll lead to a deep sense of chaos. So, push-back is natural,” says Narayanan. US President Donald Trump, himself accused of 20 instances of sexual misconduct, said of Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, “They destroy people. They want to destroy people. These are really evil people.” Alok Nath’s wife filed a defamation case against Nanda. Akbar filed a defamation suit against Priya Ramani, and after Pallavi Gogoi, a journalist now based in the US, accused him of rape, his wife, Mallika Akbar, accused the then 24-year-old of wrecking her family life by having an affair with her husband. A leading psychoanalyst in India, Mallika Akbar chose to dismiss women who had accused her husband of sexual harassment because, according to her, they never “carried the haunted look of victims of sexual assault” and because they had “happily” wined and dined at her house. FEMALE ENABLERS Female enablers, perhaps the deadliest tool of patriarchy, are often recruited to divide and destroy any movement that challenges traditional power structures and privileges. Like the old, fogey feminists who had questioned and sought to discredit Raya Sarkar’s list, this time around the protectors and enablers were out and about interrogating the women who had spoken up. “Why did you go to the hotel? What kind of girl enters a room when a man in an underwear opens the door? I would have slapped and left. Why speak up now, after so many years?” These questions didn’t just betray complete lack of empathy for the lived experience of most women in India, but also put the onus on the women. Instead of questioning the boss who called employees to a hotel room, who molested young employees in his cabin, on the sets of a film shoot, these enablers wanted to know “what kind of women” were the victims of sexual abuse. “Notice how the men have stepped out of the discourse, turning it into a women versus women fight,” says Nanda. Speaking of the enablers, she says, “These women feel no power of their own. They have only felt it through men, they can’t feel it within themselves, thus the need to stand by powerful men who, according to them, are being vilified and pilloried.” Susan Faludi wrote in her 1991 book, Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, “The backlash is a preemptive strike that stops women long before they reach the finish line.” American comedian Louis C.K., who has admitted to masturbating in front of several women, has started performing again. Brett Kavanaugh is a US Supreme Court judge. In India too, clean chits are being issued, many of the men accused by multiple women of sexual harassment are quietly returning to resume charge. MEN & MALENESS The famous American cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, often credited with laying the foundation for the 1960s sexual revolution, said that since “maleness” is not absolutely defined, “it has to be re-earned every day, and one essential element in its definition is beating women in every game that both sexes play.” Men beat women. At everything. It’s ingrained. It’s believed. Its how the world must remain. Because pivoted on this belief is the distribution of wealth, resources, power. Mead also said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has”. WHITHER JUSTICE Many ask, what does justice for victims of #MeToo look like. Is it simply that a “somebody” becomes a “nobody”? No. #MeToo is about truth and reconciliation. Since there is no law which takes into account how pervasive, common, wide-spread sexual harassment is, no legislation that seeks to change and challenge something that is so normalised, justice in #MeToo cases, for now, depends on the response. If there’s acknowledgement of the inflicted pain, hurt, trauma, if there’s remorse, if there’s an apology, then there’s closure and the women who have spoken up can try to move on. But if there’s belligerence, denial, lies, aggression, attempt to intimidate and shame, then it’s not over. Journalist-author Tushita Patel says that the reason she decided to write her account of sexual assault is because she “could not stand by and watch Akbar lie”. The #MeToo accounts, often from successful, seemingly powerful women with a strong sense of self, have chronicled a history of men’s sexual violence and women’s powerlessness. And though there’s been a “sisterhood” bond never seen before, it’s not been easy. It’s been intense, overwhelming. Not just for the women who have spoken up, and those around them, but also for those reading these accounts — especially the men and women who believed, and supported. In social media posts about #MeToo revelations now, the etiquette is to issue a “trigger warning” in the beginning, because reading another’s account can be emotionally stirring, distressing. It can also trigger a reaction, making sexual abuse survivors relive their own trauma. THE #METOO WARRIORS India’s 2018 #MeToo owes a huge debt to all those who came before — from Bhanwari Devi to the men and women who took to the streets to demand justice for Nirbhaya in 2012, from the women who accused R.K. Pachauri of sexual assault and Mahmood Farooqui of rape, to Rupan Deol Bajaj and Raya Sarkar. But #MeToo 2018 also drew its power and heft from the men and women who believed and supported it at a great emotional cost to themselves. Some may themselves have gone through sexual abuse and haven’t spoken about it, while others could not bear the injustice and decided to take up the cudgels on behalf of those who had. Some #MeToo Enablers, Warriors sent personal messages of support, while others openly expressed their outrage and anger. They demanded action, held men in power to account. They argued, fought battles on Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, at seminars, on TV for those who had spoken up, and for those who haven’t yet. As we celebrate the small victories while worrying about the gradual rehabilitation of serial harassers, and another wave of #MeToo ebbs, in the lull before the third wave, which I believe will be bigger, stronger, let’s raise a toast to the #MeToo Warriors — its to them that #MeToo 2018 belongs.",headliners,"['bare', 'sexual', 'patriarchy', 'tornado', 'power', 'india', 'harassment', 'akbar', 'men', 'theres', 'women', 'laid', 'metoo', 'accused']","And then, Jammu & Kashmir DSP Shashi Thakur levelled allegations of sexual harassment at former additional director general of police, Alok Puri.

Areeparambu Government Higher Secondary School attender alleges plot in abuse case,"However, the teachers alleged that  Navas had a history of abusing students.",,"Nov 9, 2016, 6:29 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"ALAPPUZHA: M.A. Navas, the office attender of Government Higher Secondary School, Areeparambu, Cherthala, has denied the charge that he had shown obscene pictures to a girl student on a computer in the school. The student had written an anonymous letter to Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KeSCPCR) in September saying that besides showing her computer pictures, he had also asked her to go to the bathroom with him to see obscene clips on the mobile phone.

Navas, who filed a counter-petition with the Circle Inspector, Mararikulam, alleged that the letter was an attempt to hide the misappropriation of funds by a section of women teachers. “They were conspiring to oust the headmaster, a physically challenged person, whom I supported. He had recently removed a senior woman teacher from the charge of handling the midday meal funds. This was why I was targeted,” he claimed and said that he had complained to the deputy director of education to probe the charges. “I think the letter was written by some outsider,” he said.

Pregnant woman who drink could be charged with ‘crime of violence’,'Telling a mum is not enough. They need to be helped and supported',,"Nov 27, 2014, 5:20 pm IST",Deccan Chronicle,"London: A British court is to rule on whether a woman committed a ""crime of violence"" against her child by drinking heavily during pregnancy, in a case that has raised concerns about criminalizing mothers. A local authority is applying to the governments criminal compensation authority for damages on behalf of a seven-year-old girl in its care who has severe alcohol-related disabilities. Its lawyers have told the Court of Appeal that her mother was ""reckless"" in her behaviour by drinking up to half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day while she was pregnant. While they do not suggest the damage was deliberate, they say she discussed her drinking with professionals and ""went on to take the risk"". The case, in which a ruling is expected next week, has sparked heated debate over the dangers of alcohol and the rights of women and foetuses in a country where abortion has been legal since 1967. Womens rights groups have warned that it risks opening the door to police action against pregnant women as is increasingly happening in the United States. ""The case is of profound social significance,"" said the British Pregnancy Advisory Service and Birthrights charities. ""If the court were to interpret the law as requested by the council, it would establish a legal precedent which could be used to prosecute women who drink while pregnant."" However, some commentators say it is a no-brainer. ""What about the rights of the little girl in this case whose life is forever blighted because of what her mother did?"" wrote one furious writer in the Daily Mirror tabloid. 80 cases waiting in the wings The Court of Appeal judgement will cap a five-year legal battle between the council and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA). CICA considers applications for damages involving behaviour that could constitute a crime, in this case the alleged reckless administration of a noxious substance to the foetus. In the latest stage of the proceedings in December, a judge ruled in CICAs favour and said the foetus was not a person until birth and could not be a victim of crime. This ruling is now being appealed, with 80 similar claims for compensation waiting on the outcome. Neil Sugarman, one of the plaintiffs lawyers, denies the case could move Britain closer to prosecuting pregnant women. ""We are not for a minute suggesting that will or ought to happen here,"" he told AFP. But he acknowledged the whole issue was ""fraught"" with complications, not least because drinking alcohol in itself is not a crime. ""Would it have been different if a woman had said shed decided to take tonnes of salt and the salt had damaged the child?"" he asked. Would I have stopped drinking? The girl, known only as CP, has a severe form of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), an umbrella term which covers a range of disorders varying from reduced intellectual ability to heart and kidney problems. But campaigners say it remains misunderstood and the British governments advice on drinking in pregnancy has been accused of being contradictory. ""No mother drinks intentionally to harm her child,"" said Susie Fleisher, who set up the FASD support group NOFAS-UK after her adopted daughter was diagnosed. ""A woman who has issues with alcohol should have support and not be thrown in prison."" Linda, a 49-year-old from London, was drinking eight or nine cans of lager a day when she was pregnant with her two eldest children, both in their 20s now. She had only heard about FASD in passing and says she was offered no support to give up alcohol. Her first daughter was fine but her second was born with the telltale distorted facial features and now has trouble socializing, controlling her temper and concentrating. ""Telling a mum is not enough. They need to be helped and supported,"" said Linda, who asked to remain anonymous. She opposes criminalizing pregnant mothers, but acknowledges that some custodial rehabilitation might have helped her. ""I was dependent on alcohol. I needed alcohol. I couldnt get through the day without it. ""Had I been warned of all the potential dangers and then sent home, would I have stopped? Probably not. Not without help.""",Europe,"['woman', 'crime', 'charged', 'court', 'support', 'rights', 'violence', 'drink', 'pregnant', 'case', 'drinking', 'women', 'say', 'alcohol']","London: A British court is to rule on whether a woman committed a ""crime of violence"" against her child by drinking heavily during pregnancy, in a case that has raised concerns about criminalizing mothers.

Kerala priest admits to raping minor,The accused was trying to escape to Canada,,"Mar 1, 2017, 1:11 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"KANNUR: Fr Robin Vadakkumchery, former vicar of St Sebastian’s church, Neendunokki, near Kottiyoor, who was under custody over raping a minor girl, was arrested by police on Tuesday. He was already nabbed by a team led by Peravoor CI N Sunilkumar on Monday night, while he was trying to escape to Canada. The girl had given birth in the second week of this month and the hospital authorities also tried to hush up the matter. The accused admitted his crime during interrogation. The newborn was shifted to a Christian orphanage in Vythiri, Wayanad, just a day after the delivery, said the CI, who is the investigating officer. The police shifted the newborn to a government home in Pattuvam on Monday. Fr Vadakkumchery was taken to the Parish house for collecting evidence, before taking him to Kuthuparamba judicial first class magistrate court. Since he is charged under POCSO Act, he will not receive bail until the trial is over. The 16-year-old victim was a student of IJM Higher Secondary School, Kottiyoor, where Fr Vadakkumchery was the manager. She was raped at the Parish house, said the police. The school authorities as well the parents were not aware of the pregnancy, until the delivery, they said. “The girl attended classes until February 6, and the she gave birth on February 8, if the statements are true. The parents took her to hospital in order to treat ‘an infected appendix’. It was only on Sunday, an anonymous call, from inside the school informed the Childline about the involvement of the priest in the ‘pregnancy’. The girl’s statement was taken first by women cops, to whom she said her father was responsible. The father also admitted to raping his own daughter,” the CI said. However, the police could identify the conflict between the statements of the father and the daughter and in a detailed questioning, the girl herself admitted that she was abused by Fr Vadakkumchery. Iritty DySP Prajeesh Thottathil said that the police were misled in the beginning, but the detailed questioning helped them to track the accused and trace him immediately. The police said that Christuraja hospital, Kuthuparamba, was also part of the crime, though the authorities insist that they were informed that the girl had crossed 18. The orphanage also played foul by concealing the information even from the police and Childline authorities.",Crime,"['girl', 'minor', 'admits', 'fr', 'hospital', 'priest', 'ci', 'admitted', 'kerala', 'authorities', 'vadakkumchery', 'taken', 'father', 'school', 'raping']","KANNUR: Fr Robin Vadakkumchery, former vicar of St Sebastian’s church, Neendunokki, near Kottiyoor, who was under custody over raping a minor girl, was arrested by police on Tuesday.

A bad case of Viral,"An anonymous blog post accusing The Viral Fever founder, Arunabh Kumar of sexual harassment, gained much steam on the Internet.",,"Mar 15, 2017, 12:12 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"The Viral Fever — or TVF — a trailblazer in the world of web series, found itself in the midst of a murky controversy on Monday. An anonymous author with the blog name Indian Fowler, accused TVF’s founder, Arunabh Kumar, of sexual harassment in a post that went viral on the Internet. A supposed ex-employee, she accused Kumar of molestation on various occasions. “Right from Pitchers to Tripling, I was molested. Be it in parties where Arunabh would try to lift me or would try and fall on me pretending he is drunk. One instance was the Ola deal. The Ola team was meeting him and we were taking notes. He walks out of the meeting with some excuse and calls me for some notes. I walk up. He says its time we do a quicky. I am stunned (sic),” she wrote in a 700-word long post that went on to mention in detail her trauma as a TVF employee. It went on to cause much outrage in the virtual space, with many viewers condemning the platform, and a few others calling the post a publicity stunt. When contacted, Arunabh chose not to respond to our message. Comedian Vipul Goyal, closely associated with the comedy collective, too, chose not to respond to our questions. Meanwhile, an alleged ex-employee, Aayushi Agarwal, came forward to testify against the channel. When contacted she said, “I worked for TVF for a year and three months and I was harassed by another colleague; it wasn’t Arunabh. Overall my experience was very bad as a woman. I hated working there and had to leave my job hurriedly.” She added, “I reported it to everyone there could be. My case was handled with such stupidity and callousness; nobody paid any heed. And it is only after I threatened to lodge an FIR did they come forward and fired the guy in question.” As the post continued to be circulated, another young lady called Reema Sengupta, who has worked with TVF in the past came forward to support Indian Fowler’s claims. “I was shooting with him (Arunabh) in the TVF office, for a web series I was directing last year. In the middle of the shoot, he touches my shoulder tattoo and tells me he finds it sexy. After every other shot, he would come over to the monitor to see how the shot looks, but at the same time graze his hand against my waist. Do I wish I had retaliated immediately? Yes. I didn’t because the agency and the client would have both suffered. In hindsight, that was wrong and I’m sure they would’ve supported my decision. But today, I had to choose between keeping quiet and extending my support to a girl who has bravely spoken up. TVF can release as many ‘official responses’ rubbishing these claims as they’d like. This is my truth.” Later, in an official statement issued by TVF, the collective said, “The article is completely ludicrous and defamatory against TVF and its team. All the allegations made against TVF and its team in the article are categorically false, baseless and unverified. We take a lot of pride in our team and in making TVF a safe workplace that is equally comfortable for women and men.

"Sex industry booms in Rohingya refugee camps as women struggle for food, water",The Rohingya women meet men of all backgrounds â from university students to local politicians.,,"Oct 24, 2017, 11:03 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camp’s sex industry. (Representational | Photo: AFP) Cox’s Bazaar: As Rohingya women struggle to access even the very basics such as food and water in Bangladesh’s overcrowded camps, a flourishing sex trade offers cash in times of desperation. Four women entered the clean-swept mud hut, took off their black shawls and sat cross-legged on the floor. When asked if they sold sex, the women stirred uncomfortably and were silent. Later, after cups of tea, the question came up again. The women caught each other’s eyes. Slowly one of them walked across the room to shut the door, another blocked the window. Darkness fell in the small, humid hut and voices turned to whispers. “If anyone finds out what we do, they will kill us,” murmured 26-year-old Romida. More than 600,000 ethnic Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, have fled attacks by the Myanmar army since late August, fleeing across to border to southern Bangladesh in the world’s fastest growing refugee crisis. In Kutupalong, the biggest camp, the sex industry is thriving. Many of the sex workers are longer term residents of the Bangladeshi camps, but the influx of tens of thousands more vulnerable women and girls is expected to fuel the trade. “At least 500 Rohingya prostitutes live in Kutupalong,” said Noor, who works as a fixer, but many have lived for years in the camp which was established in 1992. “Recruiters now have their eyes set on the newcomers,” she added. UN agencies say they have no figures on the numbers of sex workers in the camps to make public. “It’s hard to come by numbers and we don’t collect data on how many sex workers are in the camps,” Saba Zariv, an expert on gender-based violence at the U.N.’s population agency UNFPA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. -Rumors- A recent report from UNICEF, the U.N. children’s fund, UNICEF report said that in the chaotic, unorganised camps, children and youths could fall prey to traffickers and people looking to exploit and manipulate them. From tight-knit conservative Muslim communities, the Rohingya often turn a blind eye to prostitution. “People pretend that it doesn’t exist,” said Noor. “The girls meet their Bangladeshi clients outside the camps. They don’t sleep with other Rohingya. Our communities are tight and rumours could spread easily. Each girl wants to appear pure.” Many of the prostitutes are children who eat no more than one meal a day and don’t attend school. They work secretively without even their parents knowing. Rena, 18, who has lived in the camp for the past decade was forced to marry an alcoholic two years ago. “He mistreated me and beat me,” she said. Her abusive husband ran and left her when she gave birth to her first son. Feeding her child became impossible. “That’s when I decided to become a sex worker. I was only 16, but it was out of desperation. I needed money.” Fourteen-year-old Kamru, who also sells sex, arrived years ago in a previous wave of Rohingya refugees. She has never been able to attend school because her family is too poor. “The camp is all I remember. I grew up here, but I was always hungry,” said the teenager, who like all the women and girls did not want to reveal her full name. Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camp’s sex industry. “If aid agencies can’t manage to provide people with their basic needs, the risk of trafficking grows – if we can’t establish a sustainable mechanism here and aid tires out, we could see trafficking levels rise,” said Lisa Akero, gender protection specialist at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). -Slipping into Prostitution- Romida had been left hungry and malnourished and saw prostitution as the only way she could survive. “I told myself I’d do anything. I didn’t have a choice.” Her first client was a Bangladeshi friend who convinced her to have sex with him for 1,000 Taka ($12). “He paid good money,” she recalled. “The going-rate is 200 ($2.50) and my fixer takes half of it.” The business largely operates by phone calls, with pimps informing the girls where to go and who to see. On average, Romida has three male clients a week – and daren’t risk taking on more for fear of being found out. “I sometimes travel as far as Cox’s Bazar city, which is a two hour drive. Whenever I leave the camp, I have to make up excuses. I pretend to be visiting relatives or taking a shift at the market.” The Rohingya women meet men of all backgrounds – from university students to local politicians. In a brief phone conversation, Ali, a 23-year-old Bangladeshi student told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he sleeps with prostitutes occasionally, but when he eventually marries he would expect his wife to be a virgin. Most clients don’t use condoms, the women said. “I take birth control injections, but I worry about HIV every day,” said Romida. She has never been tested for sexually transmitted diseases. -Safe Spaces- Half an hour’s drive away from the muddy, chaotic camps, surrounded by green rice paddies, local charity Pulse has set up a safe house for refugees that can host up to 30 women. Due to open in the coming days, the dormitory-style apartment is newly refurbished and has a psychologist on site. “The girls who come here might not want to talk about what is happening in their lives as they could be in danger,” said the shelter’s manager Kurshida Aktar, adding that all vulnerable women are welcome: victims of rape, single mothers and sex workers. “We’re creating an opportunity for women to rebuild their lives, access basic needs, have an outlet to talk and receive job training,” said Aktar. But the four Rohingya women who agreed to speak were largely unaware of such services. “We don’t ask about it for fear of being found out,” said Kamru, the youngest of the girls. As she walks outside the house, she slips into her black burqa, covering all but her eyes. “I have to take it off when I’m with my Bangladeshi clients,” she said. “But in the camp it’s my way to stay anonymous.”",Neighbours,"['industry', 'girls', 'struggle', 'sex', 'food', 'workers', 'dont', 'vulnerable', 'bangladeshi', 'water', 'refugee', 'camps', 'rohingya', 'women', 'camp', 'booms']","Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camp’s sex industry.

Karnataka: Fingerprint expert’s hand in cop job scam,"The expert connived with two accused in PSI exam fraud case, Fresh complaint filed in 7-yr-old case",,"Jul 10, 2017, 5:38 am IST",Deccan Chronicle,"Bengaluru: A seven-year-old case is back to haunt a retired fingerprint expert as investigations revealed that he had connived with two brothers, who were allegedly involved in a fraudulent act in the police sub-inspector recruitment examination, and had tampered with the fingerprints to help the brothers get a clean chit. In the case that dates back to 2010, a fresh FIR has been registered against three people, including Kantharaju T.P., a retired in-charge police sub-inspector and fingerprint expert at the Karnataka State Fingerprint Bureau in Madiwala. Along with him, the brothers, Akshath B. Haddanavar and Vinaykumar B. Haddanavar, a doctor, have also been named accused. The case was that Akshath and Vinaykumar had applied for PSI posts in 2009. After the selection process was completed, the preliminary list of selected candidates was published in January 2010. Akshath was selected, while Vinaykumar was not, as he did not appear for the viva-voce examination. After the preliminary list, the Gadag SP received an anonymous letter stating that Vinaykumar had assisted Akshath in the examination by wilfully changing his name as ‘Akshath B. Haddannavar and ensuring that he got the seat next to his brother in the exam hall. He helped his brother write the examination. The investigation revealed that the accused brothers had in fact conspired to ensure that Akshath would pass the examination with the assistance of Vinaykumar, who had engineered the circumstances to ensure that he is seated next to his brother by changing his name, as the candidates were to be seated in the alphabetical order and also got his date of birth changed to May 28, 1982 to match the date of birth of his brother. It was further alleged that he had also tampered with the names of his parents as Basappa and Mangala. As it was a clear case of forgery and cheating, an FIR was registered in the High Grounds police station in 2010. “As part of the probe, there was a need to establish that Vinaykumar had written the exam sitting next to his brother. The investigating officer had collected his fingerprints to establish the presence of the petitioner on the scene. The samples were sent to the fingerprint expert, seeking his opinion. But he submitted a report indicating that the fingerprints could not be identified as that of Vinaykumar’s,” an official said. As further investigation established that the fingerprints were tampered with and they were, in fact, of Vinaykumar and that fingerprint expert Kantharaju had connived with the accused, a fresh FIR has been registered. “As the place of occurrence of the crime falls under Madiwala station, the case will be transferred to the Madiwala police,” the official said. SP’s brothers The accused brothers are the siblings of a senior police officer of the rank of a Superintendent of Police. Akshath had been issued the appointment order after he was selected, but after the charges against him were established, the police department had cancelled the order.",Crime,"['experts', 'brothers', 'cop', 'tampered', 'brother', 'karnataka', 'fingerprint', 'hand', 'examination', 'case', 'expert', 'akshath', 'fingerprints', 'job', 'vinaykumar', 'scam']","In the case that dates back to 2010, a fresh FIR has been registered against three people, including Kantharaju T.P., a retired in-charge police sub-inspector and fingerprint expert at the Karnataka State Fingerprint Bureau in Madiwala.
