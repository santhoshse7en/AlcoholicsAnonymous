Alcoholic Anonymous asked to vacate civic premises after 21 yrs,"The organisation runs its national head office from a Byculla municipal school, which BMC wants back as part of its drive to reclaim its classrooms.",,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Alcoholics Anonymous Helen Keller spread no doubt The organisation runs its national head office from a Byculla municipal school, which BMC wants back as part of its drive to reclaim its classrooms., the international organisation devoted to help problem drinkers kick the bottle, has been asked by BMC to vacate the municipal school premises in Byculla, which has been the organisation’s India head office for the last 21 years.The eviction notice, issued a few days ago, is part of the BMC drive to reclaim its classrooms from NGOs and similar organisations who are not involved in ‘education-related’ activities.In June, a similar notice had been issued to theInstitute for Deaf & Deaf blind, which occupies 11 classrooms in another municipal school in Byculla, following which the institute officials said they will take up the matter with the chief minister if forced to move out (Helen Keller Inst, BMC at loggerheads over premises, Mumbai Mirror, September 17). The institute has been running its school in its current location for the last 36 years.As per the BMC statistics, 2,000 of its classrooms across the city have been rented out to NGOs and charitable trusts on a nominal monthly rent, but several of these have been running non-educational programmes.While the Helen Keller institute said the disability of their students was so complex that regular classroom dynamics don’t work, the Alcoholics Anonymous, which operates from a municipal English medium school on Meghraj Sethi Marg, said its work was nothing less than imparting education.Arun S from Alcoholics Anonymous’ Mumbai unit said, “We have already made a representation to BMC, requesting them to consider ours as a special case. We are not using the premises for commercial gains; rather, we are helping people from across strata.”The institute,over three classrooms, operates its all-India helpline, and also publishes its pamphlets in more than 15 Indian languages.Additional Municipal Commissioner Mohan Adtani, however, promised the Alcoholics Anonymous a “positive response”. He said, “They have sent us a representation and their activities are not profit-driven. I will give them apositive response,” he said.The BMC top brass, however, feared the concessions granted to one organisation will be used against the civic body by others. Manoj Kotak, chairman, Education Committee (BMC), said the civic body will have to stick to its premises-only-for-education policy. “The guidelines are clear: all non-education institutes will have to move out of municipal schools. Organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, who aredoing a great service to the society, should be provided alternative accommodation by the government,” he said.Sources in the civic body said the BMC classrooms will no longer be given on rent. “Municipal schools will be run by private organisations or trusts in partnership with BMC, which will retain control of its schools,” the source said.",{},"['bmc', 'yrs', 'civic', 'alcoholics', 'municipal', 'classrooms', 'schools', '21', 'school', 'organisations', 'vacate', 'anonymous', 'asked', 'organisation', 'alcoholic', 'premises']","I will give them apositive response,” he said.The BMC top brass, however, feared the concessions granted to one organisation will be used against the civic body by others.

Alcoholic deaddiction awareness programme held at Vashi police stn,"Vashi:  A group of members of Alcoholic Anonymous (A A), a fellowship of men and women working for those who are willing to get rid of alcohol addiction, descen",Vashi:,None,Mumbai Mirror,"motivating talk: The AA members explained the primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety Vashi: A group of members of Alcoholic Anonymous (A A), a fellowship of men and women working for those who are willing to get rid of alcohol addiction, descended on Vashi police station on October 8 with the intention of spreading awareness among the policemen about the ill-effects of alcoholism. The members of AA aimed at achieving their primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety. They propagated their recovery programme to help the policemen to quit alcoholism, in case any of them was addicted to alcohol, and also help others in the society to quit alcohol, thereby helping them to lead a stress-free life which otherwise, due to alcoholism, adversely affects their family members. A member of Alcoholics Anonymous, on conditions of anonymity said, """"The AA recovery programme to help quit alcohol, we believe, will work for almost anyone who has a desire to stop alcohol consumption . It may work even for those who feel that they are prodded in the direction of AA. We have seen some alcoholics stumble for a while before getting on with the programme, but with repeated efforts, they have regained their senses and walked in the right path."""" SPI Raosaheb Sardesai of Vashi police station informed, """"We had conducted the training workshop for the police staff to help them understand the adverse effects of alcoholism. Hence, to achieve our goal we had invited the experienced members of the AA, who addressed the gathering of around 70 police staff comprising PIs, PSIs, APIs and the constabulary. The members propagated about the activities of the AA and the efforts taken by them to help alcoholics get rid of their addiction. The policemen like other individuals are not regular drinkers but still it is a necessity to instil within them a sense of responsibility towards the society. The awareness amongst the policemen will but naturally help them in tackling situations wherein they face people addicted to alcohol thereby enabling them to convince the alcoholics by explain them the methods of quitting alcohol, albeit gradually."""" Another member of AA, on conditions of anonymity emphasized, """"Early, in our association with AA, we heard about the Twelve Steps; of recovery from alcoholism, we learned that these steps represented an attempt by the first members to record their own progress from uncontrolled drinking to sobriety. We discovered that a key factor in this progress seemed to be humility, coupled with reliance on a power which is greater than ourselves. While some members preferred to call this power as God, we were told that this was purely a matter of interpretation. As we have grown in AA, our concept of a greater power has usually become more mature. But, it has always been our personal concept; no one has forced it upon us.” “Experience shows that alcoholics should, and can, learn to pace themselves. Live and Let live is one of the slogans of AA. When we first turned to AA, many of us had a number of serious problems involving money, family, job and our own personalities. However, we soon discovered that our immediate central problem was alcohol. Once we had that problem under control, we were able to make successful approaches to the other problems. Solutions to these problems have not always come easily, but we have been able to cope with them far more effectively when we were sober than we were able to do during our drinking days.""""

Preferably, with a nice glass of red, or maybe even something stronger. Husbands are not usually right, but your Mr-ji is perfectly within his rights to unwind this way. By your own admission, he’s drinking only moderately, and only on weekends — and I’d bring even this estimation down a peg or two because in your paranoid state, you have probably exaggerated it. To me, he doesn’t sound one bit like he’s on the road to destruction, or even the nearest centre of Alcoholics Anonymous. He’s the one who has made the more sober analysis, namely, that if you continue “nagging, crying and fighting on this issue” you will certainly drive him there. Just listen to yourself. You sound like a prissy, pursed-lip, holier-than-thou harridan. A domineering wife who thinks only she knows what’s good for her family, and everyone else is a weakling who would be ruined if you weren’t there to ‘save’ him. Why on earth should he get ‘addicted’? For your information, I know many more casual drinkers who haven’t turned into alcoholic wrecks. Let me be brutally honest. Your problem is that you were once a busy professional doing an important job for society, but now that you are a homemaker, you need to justify your existence (take out your frustrations) by nagging everybody else. Here’s something to shake you out of your alcoholism-induced delusions: if you don’t reform, your ‘happy marital life’ will indeed get ‘spoilt’, and the fault will most definitely not be your husband’s.

When life’s on the rocks,"Over twenty-six million Indians drink more alcohol than they should. Are you one of them? If so here’s why you need to slow down, and how to do it.",Lachmi Deb Roy,None,Mumbai Mirror,"TWELVE STEPS TO RECOVERY AS PRESENTED BY ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS ByOver twenty-six million Indians drink more alcohol than they should. Are you one of them? If so here’s why you need to slow down, and how to do it.According to the WHO, across the world, alcoholism claims more lives per year than even AIDS, which takes it right to the top of the ‘killer diseases’ list. Manmohan Taneja, Co-Founder of Wilson Smith Recovery Services (WSRS) which offers programmes to facilitate recovery from addictions, says, “According to a 2014 WHO report, which relied on a 2010 survey, approximately 30 per cent of the Indian population drinks alcohol; out of this 11 per cent are drinking at a harmful level, and approximately 2 per cent or 26.5 million people indulge in binge drinking.”This may come as no surprise, given the proliferation of watering holes in this city, but what should raise a red flag is Taneja’s revelation: less than 10 per cent of problem drinkers seek treatment.Roy V Tellis, who co-founded WSRS with Taneja is an alcohol abuse counsellor and a certified ’12-step consultant.’ He’s also a recovered alcoholic. Now 56, Tellis shares his experience: “Having grown up in a family where parties and drinking were regular weekend affairs, I had access to alcohol very early in life. As kids, I remember we were given a glass of shandy in all parties. That was the kind of exposure I was used to. One day, my friends and I went out trekking with two bottles of alcohol. We were just 16 years old. The booze made me feel terrific, and I didn’t want to stop at that, so I went and brought some rum from a bootlegger. I don’t even remember how I reached home that day. Later, I came to understand that I had had an alcoholic black out then.”Roy adds, “Eventually, in college, I went from being a weekend drinker to a daily drinker. I couldn’t concentrate on anything.”Consultant psychotherapist Azhar Hakim says, “Ideally, a person should not drink more than three pegs in one sitting, twice a week. Cross this limit and you’re asking for health trouble.”Psychiatrist, Dr Tanay Maiti adds, “If one wants to stop being an alcoholic, then he/she should not target complete abstinence from day one, or get frustrated if he/she relapses after a short period of abstinence. Sudden stoppage after a habit of regular drinking can cause various kinds of discomfort, even lead to medical emergencies, and this may drive you back to your previous pattern of heavy drinking.” Maiti highlights that alcoholics must remember the acronym ‘HALT.’ “It stands for Hunger, Anger, Loneliness, and Tiredness — these may work as triggers and lead to excessive consumption of alcohol, regular consumption or/and relapses.”Hakim says, “Alcoholism begins with alcohol dependence, i.e. when the person cannot do without alcohol. And one is so preoccupied with alcohol that one is constantly looking for occasions to consume it. As it progresses, one will continue to drink alcohol regardless of the financial or physical problems it causes.”He adds, “Alcohol dependency is experienced by 15 per cent of drinkers. It is incurable, but a fully treatable disease. Alcoholism is like diabetes. It is chronic and progressive. If left untreated, the problem worsens.”The reason that alcoholism remains unchecked is that, like with all addictions, addicts refuse to admit there’s a problem. Recovered alcoholic Raj Singh (name changed), a Colaba-based CA, says, “At the age of 38, I refused to listen to anybody who said that I had a drinking problem. I was irresponsible and completely negligent towards my family’s welfare. I would gulp down eight to nine bottles of beer in an hour. I must have known this was crazy because I remember lying to people about the amount I was drinking. I used to sit around in bars from 5pm to four am. There were times when I did not go to work for months. I used to be violent at home, hit my wife and break things. Yet, for all of that, at the time, I couldn’t see that I had a problem. One day, a friend dragged me to an AA meeting, and that’s when my journey of recovery began.”Chronic alcohol abuse poses many threats to one’s health and general wellbeing. Long term overconsumption causes brain cells to die and this in turn may lead to mental disorders. It can, of course, also cause liver damage and cirrhosis and inflammation of the pancreas or pancreatitis. Additionally, psychiatrist, Dr Maiti says, “Other than the body, the psyche also gets affected, leading to depression, poor anger management, impulsive disorders, and in many cases, it leads to an addiction to other substances.”Besides, the family of an alcoholic suffers through his or her addiction. Forty-seven-year-old advertising professional and resident of Parel, Shilpanjali Mehta (name changed to maintain anonymity), wife of a recovered alcoholic recalls, “I tried to control the situation, but it was crazy. I used to have to pick him up from bars late at night, and with a small baby at home, things were difficult. He used to land up drunk at every family occasion, be it a celebration or a funeral prayer — it was a huge social embarrassment, and aside from affecting his health, it was very distressing for all of us.”Shilpanjali shares, “I got in touch with Al-Anon (a group for family members of alcoholics). They taught me about the disease, and the three Cs: You have not caused it, you cannot control it, and you cannot cure it. That means you are totally powerless over another person’s drinking. Understanding this releases you from the burden of guilt and self-pity. After multiple failed attempts and disappointments whenever I tried to get him to seek help from different sources, I started focussing on myself instead, on my career and my daughter’s upbringing. I realised that I need to build my own life and be responsible for my own happiness.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

I dont think these cops will be reformed within just six months, that too on their own. They need professional help to kick their alcohol addiction. To stop them from drinking too much, CP Patnaik should send them to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. — R Castellino Police Commissioner Arup Patnaik continues to impress me. Ever since he has taken over, he has been initiating many new moves to improve the police force and rid it of corruption. Although we have heard stories about the flak police officers get from him, his stern resolution to consistently clamp down on the offenders in his team is gradually improving the image of the police force. I hope CP Patnaiks efforts are consistent. – Anjum Samel The police commissioner has targeted one of the biggest problems haunting the citys police force. Alcohol not only affects their conduct and performance, it also affects their fitness levels. I am really impressed by his firm decisions and hope he continues the good work. — Altaf H Ladiwala Fishermen need to be careful This refers to Two killed in ship-boat collision off Kerala (MM, March 2). I sympathise with the families of the fishermen who were killed. However, such episodes cannot entirely be blamed on merchant ships. As a chief officer on-board merchant ships, I have often seen fishing boats coming dangerously close to big ships. Ships, being heavy, are difficult to manoeuvre, so when the crew notices a boat coming in the path, they find it difficult to change course quickly. Moreover, with the piracy scare at coastlines, ships are forced to move closer to the western coast for safety, where such fishing incidents occur. Indian fishermen need to exercise more safety when they are out at sea. — Christopher Pereira Back up pride with performance This refers to Greatness, interrupted (MM, March 2). Sehwag is talented, aggressive and at times, he can change the course of a game. The unfortunate part is that he knows this, and, it seems, has allowed the knowledge to go to his head. Sadly, he does not have the runs right now to back his confidence. Sehwag needs to get back in form with a superb performance to prove himself worthy of his ambitions. — Mukund Kumar Made to wait for a bomb blast? This refers to RPF respond to bomb scare on train after wasting 20 minutes (MM, March 2). Imagine the state of the passengers on the train as they waited for 20 whole minutes, hoping against hope that the abandoned tiffin box was not a bomb. Is there no value of human life?

"AA, Helen Keller Inst, Cancer Foundation, to continue operating from BMC schools","In a huge relief to three top NGOs, BMC has decided to go soft on its earlier decision to evict them from municipal school buildings.",,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Helen Keller Cancer In a huge relief to three top NGOs, BMC has decided to go soft on its earlier decision to evict them from municipal school buildings.The organisations that rank among the country’s best help groups, areInstitute for Deaf and Deaf-blind,Aid and Research Foundation, and Alcoholics Anonymous.Mumbai Mirror has, over the past fortnight, reported on how BMC decided to evict social organisations and NGOs not involved in “education-related” activities, from civic schools as part of a drive to reclaim its classrooms. Over 100 organisations engaged in diverse social work currently operate from civic schools. Over three months, all were served eviction orders.However, following an outcry from activists, BMC has now decided to amend its stand. “AA will continue operating from three rooms of the Meghraj Sethi Marg school in Byculla. As they are doing genuine social work we have taken a sympathetic stand towards them,” Additional Municipal Commissioner Mohan Adtani told Mirror.“Similarly, we asked Helen Keller Institute to vacate only some classrooms at N M Joshi Marg. They can continue using the rest.” As for Cancer Foundation, Adtani said they sought time to vacate. “They can continue till they find an alternative place,” he added.While the three NGOs have been given some relief, all others must comply with eviction notices. “The administration has taken a rational decision after consulting education department officials. All NGOs are not the same. There will be opposition from some parties, but these three will not be shunted out in a hurry,” said a senior official.Makrand Narvekar, citizen corporator from Colaba who had slammed BMC’s move, has welcomed the new decision. “It will be a major boost for these NGOs.

Heartbreak cure: Why you need to celebrate the present,Love is like a drug — romantic love causes changes in brain chemistry that are remarkably similar to the use of substances like cocaine and heroin;,How to Heal Your Broken Heart by Dr Shyam Bhat is available on the Juggernaut Books app for Android and iOS,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Love is like a drug — romantic love causes changes in brain chemistry that are remarkably similar to the use of substances like cocaine and heroin; and the experience of unrequited love is similar to the experience of an alcoholic or drug addict in withdrawal, unable to live without the substance, even while they know that the substance will harm them.Alcoholics Anonymous is a group that helps people get over alcohol addiction, and some of their guiding principles may also be applied to heartbreak. The most effective of the AA strategies, when it comes to heartbreak, is to have faith in a higher power, to know that something greater than yourself will restore you to peace and happiness.It’s very hard for us to have faith in ourselves. To have faith that things will turn out all right. To know that, one day, even this difficult and painful time will recede. When we face a life situation that we don’t have solutions for, we can start feeling helpless and alone. We feel this way because, consciously and logically, we do not feel strong and complete.But the truth that you must remember, even in moments of pain and despair, is that you have a vast untapped potential and a deep wisdom that is guiding your conscious life. This internal compass and wisdom will lead you out of pain and into fulfilment, if you allow it to. Surrendering to a higher power is a way of tapping into the vast reservoirs of subconscious wisdom and strength.The times we feel weak and have lost faith in ourselves is when we most need faith. Ironically, faith in something larger than ourselves helps us unlock our own inner healing powers. And it doesn’t matter if you are an atheist or a believer – even the existence of God is not required for you to experience the benefits of surrender and faith.To know that you will be okay and that you will find happiness again is such a powerful belief that you will at once and immediately feel a sense of relief.Once you surrender to a higher power in this manner, you will find it easier to let go of the past and to live in the moment‘The secret of health for both body and mind is not to mourn for the past, not worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly.’ — The BuddhaI can hear you say, ‘How can I find peace in the present, when the present is full of pain?’ Yes, it isn’t easy to live in the present moment, when you are hurting. But consider your pain and the thoughts associated with your pain and you will find that your pain is not from the present, but from memories of the past and from worries about the future.If you forget about the past and let go of the worries of your future you will immediately begin to feel peace. This is easier said than done, of course, but I urge you to try because as you increase your depth of awareness of the present moment you will start feeling more and more peaceful.You can begin staying in the present moment and letting go of the past and the future by first focusing on your breath. Make sure that you breathe easily and steadily throughout the day. When we are tense, and stressed, we hold our breath. Our breathing becomes shallow and this pattern of breathing sends a signal to the brain that we are under stress. The stress then further tightens the breathing and so on, in a vicious cycle.Even though you may not be able to still the thoughts in your mind and your worries, you can break through the cycle of stress and find peace by first stilling your body.When you still and relax your body and relax your breathing, your mind will get the message that you are feeling safe and secure.Practise meditation in this manner once or twice a day to start increasing your awareness of the present moment. It will help you let go of the past, celebrate the future and enjoy the present moment.",{},"['know', 'need', 'heartbreak', 'peace', 'moment', 'faith', 'present', 'cure', 'celebrate', 'live', 'past', 'pain', 'future', 'feel']","To know that, one day, even this difficult and painful time will recede.

Joseph Pereira: Mumbai Heroes,"For 36 years now, Fr Joseph Pereira has been using yoga to rehabilitate addicts.",A Father’s healing touch,None,Mumbai Mirror,"A Father’s healing touch Father Joseph Pereira GETS MY VOTE For 36 years now, Fr Joseph Pereira has been using yoga to rehabilitate addicts.Kripa FoundationCuring innumerable people of their addictionsByAt the dormitory behind his office-cum-residence, Father Joseph Pereira, fondly known as “Father Joe”, stops to assist a student trying out ardha halasana (half plough pose). To the casual observer, this may appear to be an ordinary yoga lesson, but this dormitory doubles as a rehabilitation centre, and 75-year-old Fr Joe is a healer and crusader, who has been fighting against addiction for 36 years.To this end, in 1981, he founded the Kripa Foundation, a modest facility on the premises of Mt Carmel Church, Bandra (W). Over the years, the centre has grown into one of the largest NGOs in the field of rehabilitation of chemical dependency and HIV/AIDS. Affiliated with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Kripa now has 65 centres in 11 states, 16 archdioceses and dioceses, and collaborations in six countries.Fr Joe, who will complete 50 years of priesthood on September 23 and recently sought Pope Francis’s blessings at the Vatican in Rome, continues to work hands-on. His unique rehabilitation model incorporates the asanas, postures and pranayama techniques he learnt from his yoga guru BKS Iyengar. A yoga practitioner for 49 years, Fr Joe believes that to cure addictions, the healing must involve the soul and the mind.“Abstinence is not always enough. People who give up alcohol or drugs may develop addictions to sex, gambling, money, power, pornography or other things. The Kripa Foundation therefore aims to change the addict’s lifestyle through a holistic approach. That’s where, yoga comes in,” said Fr Joe, who has worked closely with Mother Teresa.Several reformed addicts have stayed on at his centres, taking on positions in administration or working on rehabilitation projects.“One of my students, a well-known industrialist, has been sober for 19 years. Another gentleman, whom I found in a desperate state at Asha Daan (a home founded by Mother Teresa), 22 years ago has not tasted liquor since,” added Fr Joe, whose work has won him the Padma Shree and the National Award from the President of India. A former trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, he has written several books and research papers on deaddiction and yoga.In the 1980s, when he was appointed the head of Mt Carmel Church, a part of Bandra was being reclaimed and the fishing community was hit hard. “People lost their jobs and it led to the rise in alcoholism.

Determined to guide them away from their addictions, I appealed to the Archbishop Cardinal Simon Pimenta and though it took some convincing, he gave me permission to run the de-addiction centre from the church premises for a year. Ultimately, he was so impressed he said ‘Joe, I believe you are doing God’s work’.”Today, the Kripa Foundation treats over 1,000 addicts annually and also offers care and support to the HIV-affected (it has rehabilitated close to 1,500 children grappling with the disease). “People come to Kripa because it follows Mother Teresa’s ethos.

"If I didn't quit now, I'd have drank myself to the grave: Pooja Bhatt",Pooja Bhatt opens up on her battle with the bottle and how she reclaimed herself.,On Christmas I went to bed sober,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Pooja Bhatt alcohol Mahesh Bhatt Sanjay Dutt Narayan Niyogi Anupam Kher Alia Bhatt Filmfare Best Actress Award opens up on her battle with the bottle and how she reclaimed herself.Today is the 68th day and Pooja Bhatt hasn’t touched a drop ofsince she pulled the plug on December 24. She’s gone through Christmas and New Year and even brought in her 45th birthday on February 24 without a drink. Talking about her battle with the bottle openly in the public space is part of her catharsis.“I want to bust the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because it’s a matter of shame for the family. We don’t share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer,” says Pooja, admitting that in her case it was a chat with her father that led to this decision.On December 21,messaged her from Delhi and they got talking about the state of the country, about leaders who in their eagerness to imprint their footsteps in the sands of time create absolute mayhem. As he was ringing off, he told her, “I love you kid.” She responded, “I love you too pops. As far as I’m concerned, there is nothing else worth loving in the world.” He replied, “If you love me then love yourself because I live in you.”Her father had never alluded to her problem, but the text urging her to love herself, struck a chord. Pooja promised him that “from this moment I’m going to be the best ‘me’ I’m capable of being” and after putting down the phone wondered if going out with someone and polishing off a bottle of whisky was loving herself. The answer was a resounding ‘no’.On Christmas Day, the Bandra girl who is Christian by faith, put her phone on silent and sat in her apartment with her four cats listening to the strains of “Silent Night” wafting in from somebody’s home. “I ate dinner and went to bed at 11.40 pm, sober. At midnight I heard the bells of the four churches ring and felt rejuvenated,” she exults.She took off for a holiday to Lahore, to Delhi, to several places. And while in the past she’d spent evenings alone, with a bottle of wine, in some café, watching the world go by, this time, she stayed away from the wine. Not just through Christmas but even the drunken revelry of New Year.The public pressure escalated as her birthday neared. She toyed with the idea of taking one drink. “But then I asked myself if I needed it, and if I did, why stop with one glass? Why not drink the whole bottle of champagne because as somebody said, ‘One drink is had with the enemy.’ I called my friends to my farm, we swam at 2 am, we did many fun things, but I didn’t drink,” she smiles.She’d smoked her first cigarette at 23 and has never done cocaine. But she was drinking by the time she was 16. Growing up in an Anglo-Indian environment, it was normal for wine to be passed around the table and beer opened on Sunday. Even in the film industry there were people drinking copiously.“Alcohol is comforting, it colours your evening. It’s a socially accepted narcotic even at business lunches and in the boardroom. Also, living in a fast-paced city, being in a high-stress profession, it becomes a reason to celebrate and cope with failure. Your film is a hit, you bathe in champagne, it flops, a single malt lessens the pain,” she avers.Two years ago, Pooja ended her marriage. Though the end of a 10-year relationship is akin to death, she did not give herself time to mourn. She moved on, and the world said cheers to her spirit and energy. “Before I knew it, it’s a whirlwind of hedonism,” sighs Pooja who can drink every man in the room under the table thanks to her Scottish genes and her father’s genes. “I was born to a man who has never done anything in half measures and I inherited that. So when I drank, I drank copiously. Your appetite increases even as the alcohol does terrible things to your body, clutters your mind and colours your judgement of the people you’re hanging out with.”One evening, in the middle of another mindless conversation, she asked herself if she’d be sitting there without the alcohol. The answer was another ‘No’ and it was time for some soul searching!She’d seen what alcohol did to her father, how it had killed her parents’ marriage. She’d been in relationship with an alcoholic and got her into the news. She’d lost a friend at 40 to alcohol and had a drink to mourn her. But all this while, it was someone else’s problem, she was in control. This time, as her father had urged, she looked into the mirror unflinchingly and acknowledged she had a problem too.“I was 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which had got watered down,” says Pooja.She was in Delhi recently sharing the stage withwho admitted he’d been a shy kid and drinking had made it easier for him to talk to a girl. Pooja’s never been shy or short on confidence. For her drinking was a way of deflecting reality till she became a victim of what she calls mindless drinking.“Luckily, I pulled the plug before it became impossible for me to stop. I’m in the pink of health except for the weight I put on because I’m now a stressful producer. But being the daughter of an alcoholic makes you four times more susceptible to becoming one,” she says.She didn’t need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as she had strong support systems in her dad and her Cabaret director Kaustav (). Years ago, Mahesh Bhatt had picked up his younger daughter, Shaheen and the child had moved her head away. That day he quit drinking and never went back even though as you see in the climax of Daddy, one night after returning from the shoot and pouringa drink, he was tempted to take one too after everyone had left and Pooja was asleep. He asked himself who’d know and realised that he could lie to the world but not himself. He would know! “I didn’t think that the girl who’d counselled her father in Daddy would one day council herself,” Pooja says poignantly.Kaustav quit drinking two years ago because if anything went wrong on the Cabaret sets, he didn’t want anyone to blame it on his drinking. “No one thought he could stay 24 hours without alcohol but he proved them wrong. “For me these two are shining examples, who understand without me telling them anything,” she says, but agrees for many others, institutions like AA are necessary. “There are many who want you to fail. Strangers are more supportive than some of your own because your battle makes them realise that they have failed,” she points out.Today, Pooja herself has no problem being around anyone who drinks. She has a fully stocked bar at home and even pours out drinks for friends. “If I can’t be around alcohol and resist it, it means I’m not in control. Each day strengthens my resolve as I realise I have more hours to a day now. Even when I drank till 4 am, I’d be at work at 10 am but I was burning myself out. Today, I feel lighter with the excess water gone. All the drama alcohol brings is eliminated from your life,” she says.Her biggest victory was waking up to the news of her baby sisterwinning the. “I messaged Alia saying normally this would have been an excuse for me to crack open a case of champagne first thing in the morning. But this time I celebrated by not drinking,” Pooja signs off.",{},"['grave', 'didnt', 'world', 'drinking', 'id', 'im', 'drink', 'day', 'love', 'bhatt', 'bottle', 'pooja', 'father', 'quit', 'alcohol', 'drank']","She’s gone through Christmas and New Year and even brought in her 45th birthday on February 24 without a drink.

Lindsay is a temptress,Lindsay is a temptress,,None,,"Scent of Lohan Lindsay Lohan was told by Jane Fonda that she was a sexy temptress. Lindsay plays a sexually charged city wild child who is sent to live in the country with her grandmother, played by Fonda, in their latest film Georgia Rule.Lohan asked Fonda for some advice on how to approach the racy role but was told by the iconic actress she was already perfect for the part because she is so alluring.The Mean Girls star told In Style magazine: “My characters overtly sexual.

BMC killing city’s social institutions in one big swoop,"Over 100 NGOs face shut down, even as BMC allows IB courses & coaching classes to be run from its schools.",Iconic institutions hit,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Over 100 NGOs face shut down, even as BMC allows IB courses & coaching classes to be run from its schools.The civic authority’s decision to reclaim municipal classrooms rented out to non-profit groups is threatening to derail the city’s entire social-work setup.More than 100 organisations engaged in diverse social-work realms - from empowering the disabled, tackling addiction to providing free medical care - currently run their centres in municipal schools across Mumbai. All of them have been given eviction orders by the BMC over the past three months.These include some of the country’s best help groups such as Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deafblind, Cancer Aid and Research Foundation and Alcoholics Anonymous.The reason: civic authorities have ruled that only NGOs and charitable organisations carrying out “educational activities” will be allowed to use municipal classrooms at a nominal rent.The new policy for the use of spare municipal classrooms - there are 626 across the city - will force many social-help groups not engaged in formal teaching to find alternative premises by paying exorbitant rents or temporarily suspend their operations. “If the BMC enforces the policy, it will kill the city’s social institutions,” citizen corporator Makrand Narvekar said.But even as the BMC tries to push out non-profit organisations that do not fall in its arbitrary classification of educational groups, it is allowing commercial coaching classes to operate in municipal schools. Some, in fact, have turned public schools for poor students into full-fledged international schools that charge hefty fees for admission.The city administration took the call to “reclaim” rented-out classrooms three months ago following an uproar in the state assembly over misuse of space in municipal schools.Congress legislator Alka Desai and Lok Bharti Party legislator Kapil Patil raised the issue, prompting an admission from Minister of State for Urban Development Uday Samat that BMC classrooms had been leased out to “non-educational organisations”.Instead of ordering a crackdown on organisations that use the space solely for commercial gain, the state government directed the BMC to evict NGOs and charitable groups not carrying out educational work.Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deafblind, Cancer Aid and Research Foundation and Alcoholics Anonymous - all of which run their centres in municipal schools in Byculla - were served with eviction orders in the past three months.While some of the social-help groups may not face difficulty in relocating, organisations like Helen Keller will be severely affected. The institute, founded in 1977, occupies 11 classrooms on the ground floor of a Byculla municipal school on NM Joshi Marg - the space it rented in 1979. It started off with just three students, but now has 115 students, adults and children, with vision and hearing difficulties.They are taught basic life and work skills –– from reading Braille, making jute bags to using animation software. Over the past 34 years, it has trained thousands of such students in need of special care. The BMC sent an eviction notice to the iconic institution in June, saying it needed the classrooms to implement the Right to Education programmes.The institute argued that Mumbai lacked alternative infrastructure to accommodate students with multiple disabilities, and requested the BMC to reconsider. Officials, however, said the organisation’s efforts didn’t qualify as educational work and asked the management to move out.“The disability of students is so complex that regular classroom dynamics don’t work. Since most of them are deaf blind or have multiple disabilities, only one-teacher one-student interaction works,” Devyani Hadkar, coordinator of the institute’s Computer Education and Academics, said.Hadkar added: “We don’t offer them formal education since they wouldn’t be able to comprehend it. Much of their initial education is based on acquiring basic life skills, followed by social and work skills.”Cancer Aid and Research Foundation’s offices are also located in the same Byculla municipal school. The foundation, set up in 2001, sponsors treatment of hundreds of poor patients diagnosed with cancer. To date, it has spent Rs 13 crore.The foundation was served with an eviction notice in July, and it has time till December. “It was a shock. We are a non-profit organisation, and have helped thousands of patients in the city,” said co-founder Rashida Kazi.She added: “We have 84 employees and we occupy five rooms by paying nominal rent. Moving to another place in south Mumbai will be very expensive. Funds that can be used to help the poor will be wasted on rent.”The foundation feels instead of forcing reputed NGOs out, authorities should take action against sham social-help groups that enjoy concessions from the BMC. “The BMC should support organisations that are doing good work for society,” she said.A civic official said the BMC had no doubts about the foundation’s credibility, but the new policy didn’t allow non-educational groups to occupy classrooms. “We are just implementing the government’s orders. We don’t have the power to make exceptions,” the official said. “There are many other organisations that are doing quality social work, but they will also have to vacate classrooms.”Alcoholics Anonymous, the international organisation devoted to help problem drinkers kick the bottle, has also been asked to move out of a municipal school in Meghraj Sethi Marg, Byculla. Three rooms on the English medium school’s ground floor have been the organisation’s Indian head office for the past 21 years.Arun S, from Alcoholics Anonymous’ Mumbai unit, said the group’s work was nothing less than imparting education. “We are not involved in any commercial activity. We have a long-standing reputation and it has helped thousands of drinkers to overcome the habit,” he said.The organisation uses the three classrooms to print its de-addiction literature in 15 Indian languages. The rooms also house the organisation’s national helpline. “We have made a representation before BMC, requesting them to consider ours as a special case,” he said.But Manoj Kotak, chairman of the civic body’s education committee, hinted that it was unlikely to provide any relief. “These NGOs are not using classrooms for teaching. Also, they pay very little rent. The BMC’s norms are clear, and we cannot provide concessions to anybody,” he said.The reclaimed classrooms will be used to implement RTE programmes and also set up libraries.While non-profit groups are facing eviction, private organisations are being allowed to misuse municipal classrooms. A four-storey building in Dongri once housed Walpakhadi Municipal School. But in 2005, it was rented out to South Bombay Public Charitable Trust, which opened Fazlani L’Academie Globale School.The school was given permission to run 28 classrooms, but a BMC audit revealed that it had made illegal alterations and opened 48 rooms.Another private group, Old Student Association, allegedly runs commercial coaching classes from a municipal school in Nagpada. Authorities had rented out the premises to the association for a reading and guidance room for poor students, but it later started classes for entrance exams, local activists claim.Additional Municipal Commissioner Mohan Adtani said the BMC would review all such cases before forcing organisations to vacate civic schools. “NGOs that are doing credible work should be provided some leeway,” he said.Citizen corporator Makrand Narvekar said the civic body should revise its policy. “What is the use of a policy that is anti-people?”",{},"['citys', 'bmc', 'students', 'swoop', 'groups', 'municipal', 'social', 'schools', 'school', 'organisations', 'work', 'ngos', 'institutions', 'killing', 'classrooms', 'big']","“If the BMC enforces the policy, it will kill the city’s social institutions,” citizen corporator Makrand Narvekar said.But even as the BMC tries to push out non-profit organisations that do not fall in its arbitrary classification of educational groups, it is allowing commercial coaching classes to operate in municipal schools.

Unwilling or unable?,"Why do men get 'too tired' for sex? Initial brainstorming with several women yielded these gems: ""He's a chronic masturbator""; ""He's secretly gay""; ""He has perf",When he has a sexual dysfunction,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Why do men get too tired for sex? Initial brainstorming with several women yielded these gems: ""Hes a chronic masturbator""; ""Hes secretly gay""; ""He has performance anxiety""; ""Hes found God""; ""As long as he isnt getting it elsewhere, we can both be celibate"" and ""He cant get it up and is pretending hes exhausted"". Several factors can bring a mans engines to a sputtering stop and he may not necessarily have found solace in another womans bed (but run over our checklist below, just to make sure!).Sexual dysfunction can be defined as a variety of problems from arousal (like, impotence - failing to achieve or maintain an erection) to desire (like, lack of interest in sex) and fear of intimacy. Since so many options are now available for the treatment of ED, disorders caused by a number of factors must be assessed when treating sexual dysfunction: psychological issues, childhood problems, sexual history, marital stability and communication, mood disorders or emotional problems and a history of sexual abuse.When his workload piles up too high, sex often slides into second, third or no place. Stress is probably the major cause of loss of desire in most males. De-stressing is important. Women are socialised to believe men want sex all the time. So when he doesnt always feel horny, women feel personally rejected. An honest conversation is required, or else youll wear out your vibrator and start looking around for another man.Erections are about blood engorging the penis. So, diabetics often face ED owing to the changes induced in the penis by high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high glucose. Additionally, some of the medicines used to treat these conditions can also cause ED. Diabetics normally dont lack a desire for sex, but their ability to perform is reduced. Physical factors like fatigue, chronic illnesses, hormonal imbalances and nerve damage are common causes for a sudden disinterest in sex. So, dont sit on uncertainty. Its important to rule out underlying medical causes for his inability to rise to the occasion. Some common emotional causes of ED are anxiety, depression, anger and sexual ignorance. Furthermore, being overweight, taking pills for blood pressure, tranquillisers or anti-depressants can all reduce sexual desire and performance too. A person may be depressed and not be aware of it. Consult a counsellor.After a night of heavy drinking, the only thing one wants to do in bed is sleep. As Shakespeare says of alcohol in Macbeth: ""...it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance..."" Basically, alcohol inhibits the inhibitory neurons and the individual acts more spontaneously. It therefore increases sexual desire initially - but alcohol also reduces the ability to perform, thereby leading to ED. Stop the cycle of sexless nights! If his drinkings getting out of hand, look up Alcoholics Anonymous. Drug abuse, too, can cause sexual problems. Get him rehab help.All cases of dysfunction are not extreme. Seema (names changed), 28, says her sex life took a nose-dive when her husband developed a fear of making her pregnant. ""So I started taking my pill at the breakfast table, and I think that reassured him."" Riya, 31, says her boyfriend used to have performance anxiety, so they limited themselves to oral sex until he was comfortable enough to go all the way. ""He got over it,"" she smiles, ""so women neednt think its all over forever if there are some dry spells."" Performance anxiety is a common problem in men with both short- and long-term erection failures.If a couple has other problems in their relationship - disagreements about money, child-rearing or domestic roles - the resentment may creep into the bedroom. Also, when a man can predict every move his partners going to make, or when intercourse is relegated to the same time-slot (every Tuesday and Saturday, straight after the late TV news and always in the bedroom!), the prospect of intercourse is often less than thrilling.

Furthermore, being overweight, taking pills for blood pressure, tranquillisers or anti-depressants can all reduce sexual desire and performance too.
It therefore increases sexual desire initially - but alcohol also reduces the ability to perform, thereby leading to ED.
Drug abuse, too, can cause sexual problems.

BMC asks NGO educating sex workers’ children to move out of civic school,"Tremendous risk that beneficiaries may be lost to prostitution, says institution.",,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Tremendous risk that beneficiaries may be lost to prostitution, says institution.A non-profit organisation that educates commercial sex workers and their children is now the latest social institution to get a notice from the BMC to vacate its civic school premises. Apne Aap Women’s Collective (AAWC), which operates out of three classrooms in a municipal school in Kamathipura, has been asked to move out by February 28.AAWC has been functioning out of the school since 1998 and specialises in helping children in the red light area through school and college so that they are not pressed into prostitution from the pressure of their circumstances.Its latest beneficiary is Shweta Katti, an 18-year-old who is currently pursuing a course in psychology at Bard University in New York on a scholarship. It was AAWC’s hand-holding that helped her make the journey from Kamathipura to where she is now.After Shweta completed high school, AAWC, which had been helping her since she was in class four, took her to Kranti, an NGO which educates and empowers trafficked girls to help them pursue further education.AAWC has now requested for more time at its premises. “We were served notices last year. Now we have been told to move out by the month end. If we are forced to discontinue services at this centre, we face the tremendous risk of losing our current beneficiaries to a lifetime in prostitution. We should at least be given time till the academic year ends so that the kids don’t suffer,” said Girish Dand, Office Bearer at AAWC.AAWC has provided educational and health services to more than 2,500 women and children, mostly victims of human trafficking. “We are proud say that many of our women have exited prostitution and found employment in professions like social work, tailoring, and agriculture. Among the graduates of our girls’ programme, 100% have escaped prostitution by getting their Bachelor’s or Master’s degrees and by entering respected professions like accounting, hotel management, luxury cuisine, nursing, photography, retail, social work, and teaching,” he added. The NGO now plans to write a fresh letter to the BMC.In October Mirror had reported that more than 100 organisations engaged in diverse social-work realms - from empowering the disabled to providing free medical care – and running their centres in municipal schools across Mumbai, had been issued eviction orders by the BMC.This move is threatening to derail the city’s voluntary social service network.Those issued notices eviction included some of the countrys best known organisations such as the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deafblind, Cancer Aid and Research Foundation and Alcoholics Anonymous. However, following the news reports, BMC stayed their immediate eviction and gave the institutions extra time.Civic officials said that only NGOs and charitable organisations carrying out ""educational activities"" would be allowed to use municipal classrooms at a nominal rent. “They have been asked to move out as per procedure. We sent them notices and after considering their representation, an order was passed,” said a senior civic official.BJP corporator Manoj Kotak, Chairman of the BMC’s Education Committee, said he would give AAWC another hearing. “We will give them another hearing. If the NGO is doing genuine work and imparting education or similar, allied activity, then it should be given some extension,” Kotak said.",{},"['ngo', 'asks', 'bmc', 'sex', 'educating', 'civic', 'municipal', 'social', 'school', 'prostitution', 'workers', 'work', 'organisations', 'notices', 'children', 'eviction']","Tremendous risk that beneficiaries may be lost to prostitution, says institution.A non-profit organisation that educates commercial sex workers and their children is now the latest social institution to get a notice from the BMC to vacate its civic school premises.

How to deal with teen drinking,"A growing band of liberal-minded parents feel teen drinking is no big deal. But here’s why it must be nipped in the bud, and how to do it.",Ananya Sengupta,None,Mumbai Mirror,"World Health Organisation Puducherry Rajasthan Maharashtra ByA growing band of liberal-minded parents feel teen drinking is no big deal. But here’s why it must be nipped in the bud, and how to do it.Every Saturday, 47-year-old Sujata Joshi (name changed) turns into a bundle of nerves. It is the time of week when her 20-year-old daughter, Sargam, goes out with her friends.“The moment I hear her planning her weekend outing, I start getting palpitations. Her idea of fun is to go out drinking with her friends,” says Joshi, a single parent — her husband passed away three years ago — based in Andheri. “Will she be okay? Will she come home and embarrass me in front of her grandparents? These are some of the questions that keep going through my mind all day,” she says.Sargam, who is on medication for clinical depression, started drinking when she was 17 years old, Joshi tells us.Teens hitting the bottle is a rising trend in urban India. According to a recentstudy, 70 per cent of boys and girls under the age of 15 in the country have already had their first taste of alcohol.Experts, however, put the onus of alcohol addiction among teens squarely on the shoulders of the parents. “In children, alcohol addiction can start as early as 13-15 years” says psychiatrist and psychological counsellor Dr Pradnya Ajinkya. “It’s caused by the inability to distinguish between right and wrong which is something that needs to be taught early on in life. Dysfunctional families, where parents do not spend enough time with their teens, families where each member spends more time on laptops and phones rather than talking to each other are more likely to spring alcoholics.”“Families must face the fact that alcohol addiction is a reality today,” Ajinkya says. “Parents should consciously and deliberately take preventive measures. they must be on the lookout for signs of addiction if they suspect that their child consumes alcohol. And, they should take the time to do together, like go for outings.”Forty-seven-year-old Mitali Kamat who runs a skill development centre in Andheri, does just that. No less than a private investigator, she is relentless in her efforts to keep her two sons — 21-year-old Avanish and 11-year-old Shrish — away from the vice.“My older son had his first Breezer when he was in Class X. I was shocked. He’s 21 now and I know he drinks. Lifestyles are so different nowadays. The kids go to a birthday party almost every weekend; and, of course, they drink there. He has friends who drink, and as a mother, I have no control over that,” says Kamat.As a parent, Kamat says, the only thing she can do is to keep telling her sons about the pitfalls of drinking and “leave the rest to God”. She also makes it a point to forward all drinking-related messages to her son, she tells us with a laugh, adding “I can only hope he reads them and takes some precautions.”For 45-year-old Deepti Gaekwad (name changed), a Mulund-based MNC executive, it was a culture shock when she found out that her 18-year-old daughter, Payal, would drink alcohol ever so often.“Since she was 15, she has gone through the whole gamut of binge drinking, throwing up, missing school and sleeping through entire days. For the longest time I ignored it, thinking the problem will just go away. Her life now is in tatters and I blame myself,” says Gaekwad, who checked Payal into a rehabilitation centre in the city after a drunk driving incident last year.The common denominator that binds these three women — Gaekwad, Joshi and Kamat — together is that all their families serve booze at social dos and children see the alcohol flowing freely into the glasses of their near and dear ones — they can’t wait to start themselves.“Each time at a family gathering when Sargam is offered a drink, I silently pray that she refuses. She never does,” Joshi says. Kamat, on the other hand, finds it difficult to make her younger son understand why his brother is allowed to drink at family get-togethers while he is not.30-year old Parthiv — he prefers to share only his first name — tasted his first drink, “when my father offered me a glass when I was about 16.” Today, at 30, he struggles to stay on the wagon.“My father told me that I could have a drink with him whenever I wanted to, and I need not do so on the sly. Since I was 16, I tasted a wide range of alcohol with him during weekends. Then, I would show off my experience with alcohol at parties and at gettogethers with friends, and for a short period in my life I was a hero, the gang leader,” says Parthiv, who now attends Alcohol Anonymous meetings twice a week in Mumbai. He’s had a failed marriage and a suicide attempt.“One day it all came crashing down. I do not blame my father, but I often wonder if I would be the same man if he hadn’t offered me that glass of vodka,” he says.Mumbai-based psychiatrist Dr Avinash De Sousa believes that parents as well as teens should understand that the ability to guzzle booze is not an accomplishment. And, allowing your teens to drink alcohol does not make you ‘cool’.“What it does, is give teens a false sense of self-esteem,” says Dr De Souza. “Parents may demonstrate their liberal attitude in other areas. They must remember that a teen’s brain is a still developing and once introduced, the craving for alcohol develops. This is a habit that should neither be introduced, nor cultivated by parents. It is simply hazardous behaviour.”But, for parents, it doesn’t help that there’s no support group. Gaekwad says that she can’t discuss her daughter’s drinking with anyone.“The mothers of all the other girls in my daughter’s age or peer group do not seem to be aware of the problem. When I try to bring it up, they don’t want to discuss it,” she says. She recognises the signs that her daughter’s been drinking from her flushed appearance and “when she talks more than usual, and is generally sluggish.”Kamat lists other signs to look for: “loss of appetite, sudden weight loss or gain, a loss of interest in academics, a constant need for sleep and a lack of focus.”“I keep a keen eye on my boys. My younger one is 11 years old and I am more worried about him. I have restricted the time he spends outside the house and I keep talking to him about his friends and what he does when he is not home,” says Kamat, who has set an age limit of 18 years for her boys to taste alcohol.Gaekwad says, “It may be oldschool, but the fact that my daughter drinks, disgusts me. At the same time, I do realise that drinking is now a part of life. My daughter prioritises her peer group over me. If I tell her anything, she has a standard answer — ‘don’t screw up my life’.”In India, there is no uniform law related to legal age of drinking — it varies from state to state. While it is legal to drink alcohol at the age of 18 inand, the age-limit is 25 in Delhi. In, one can buy a bottle of whisky at the age of 18 but can consume it only if the person is above 25. The fact that there’s a law against it indicates that it isn’t right, but the seemingly arbitrary restriction creates ambiguity about why it isn’t right for teens to drink.Alcohol affects the structure and function of the developing brain. It alters the action of two major neurotransmitters and disrupts the communication between nerve cells and other cells of the body. This is what causes the sluggishness, the lethargy and slurred speech that drunk people experience. The hippocampus, important for memory and learning, and the prefrontal lobe which is responsible for planning, judgment, impulse control and decision making are particularly sensitive to alcohol in the teenage years. So, if you’re still trying to figure out what age they should be allowed to drink at, the answer is clearly not at all before 18, and then, the later the better.",{},"['teens', 'drinking', 'age', 'joshi', 'parents', 'drink', 'does', 'deal', 'alcohol', 'kamat', 'teen', 'life']","World Health OrganisationPuducherryRajasthanMaharashtraByA growing band of liberal-minded parents feel teen drinking is no big deal.

There, she learned basic French, bonded with nature and made plenty of friends. Wed love to guarantee the 23-year-old that lunching at the newly migrated Soul Fry Casa might be the second best thing that happen to her, but refrain. Instead, the whole since youre Goan and the cuisine is Goan excuse seems to work very well. THE AMBIENCE Mendes cant seem to take her eyes of the little watering can by the fountain that stands at the landing between the upper and lower levels. When we point out that perhaps she could wash her hands there once the food is done, conversation is terminated for roughly five minutes. The cheerful Goan music playing in the background revived her spirits, however, and soon she waxed eloquent about its cheerful, warm interiors...the dark wood, the anonymous, peeling portraits on the wall and the chandeliers. ""They lend the interiors an older, sombre touch, balanced by the colourful decor and the happy, yellow, stone seating,"" she says. THE LURE Every regional cuisine has its peculiar stereotyped favourites, like Butter Chicken, Neer Dosa, Seekh Kebab, and were relieved that Mendes stays away from the Sorpotel and Vindaloo. She decides that the Prawn Loncha and Crispy Calamari make for decent enough starters, while the Prawn Xacuti, Dry Crab Rechad, Fish Ambotik (with a plate of white rice) form part of the main course. ""Ive never heard of a Prawn Thali,"" she says, tapping her chin with the index finger; and before it causes a dent, we choose to go in for the thali as well. For the alcohol inclined, the restaurant offers a choice between White or Red Wine (priced by the glass) and a selection of mocktails. Our jaws almost dropped however, when we requested a glass of Port and the waiter responded with, ""Whats that?"" THE FOOD The classic sweet-tooth syndrome forces Mendes to work backwards, beginning with dessert. ""Im a sugar-holic and Soul Frys version of the classic Goan dessert - bebinca was excellent. They make individual portions, served on a bed of caramel. The flavours were just right, as was the texture. The caramel, added an interesting dimension to it,"" she says. Mendes also recommends the Prawn Loncha and that pickle that goes with it. ""The seafood had lots of flavour,"" she says. (Of course, we had been warned that she is a strict fishetarain). The Fish Ambotiks tangy flavour complemented the white rice superbly and though we would have preferred to get messy with the Crab Rechad, it was yummy even in its de-shelled avatar. THE SERVICE ""This restaurant really understands what susegaad means to all Goans. Its probably one of the longest afternoon lunches Ive ever had. The waiters are pleasant and the service is fine, you just have to prepare yourself for a slow lunch,"" says the label-and-artist manager. THE VERDICT Located off the bustling Fort area, Soul Fry Casa makes for a lovely afternoon work lunch. Mendes takes (mild) exception to this saying that most people in the city refuse to invest so much time in food. ""It could work better as a respite for busy Colaba shoppers,"" she adds, helpfully. ""Yes, but on a slow Sunday afternoon when the world is mine and a long siesta is slotted in…"" You get the picture.

When Pink Turns To Red,"It seems like just another day in the lobby of Cinemax, a multiplex in Lokhandwala. Certainly not one to remind you that its 33-year-old manager, Mandar Patil,","Everyone in the theatre management circuit knew that Mandar was a queen, but nobody expected things to get this bad",None,Mumbai Mirror,"Cinemax multiplex Lokhandwala Versova industry murder Dubai Vartak Polytechnic College Vasai climax It seems like just another day in the lobby of, ain. Certainly not one to remind you that its 33-year-old manager, Mandar Patil, was found in a pool of his own blood with stab wounds on his head, neck and abdomen, dumped at an ice factory opposite a bus depot in. Homosexual intrigue was the cause. Patil, who was married a year ago, had been harassing a coffee vendor from the food and beverages department of Cinemax. Unlike the exorbitant prices of snacks at multiplexes, the vendors themselves are ironically strapped for cash, poorly paid chaps. “Rs 4,500 is all he got, it’s a measly sum. And he was getting steadily depressed with the sexual harassment being meted out to him at the hand of Mandar. Everyone in the theatre management circuit knew that Mandar was a queen, but nobody expected things to get this bad,” said a source, also gay, from the multiplexwho wished to remain anonymous given the shroud that already surrounds the homicide.The coffee vendor, Sreenath Jogi, and a couple of his friends took Patil out for drinks to the shebeen in Versova village where Patil and the object of his affection often downed drinks after work. The intent was to convince him to stop making sexual advances towards Jogi. By the time they got down to explaining, Patil was drunk and raucous, the men armed with weapons; the scene turned ugly. Patil was stabbed, but still alive. Then fearful that they would be caught, the men chose to make the scene look like a gruesomewith theft as motive, which it wasn’t.The incident brings to light the perils of internalised oppression and how it can take on a frightening machismo that often brings to relief the fault lines of an unequal society. These blood-stained episodes send tremors through society, and both straight and queer quarters are squeamish when discussing the matter at hand because it reveals the constant tug of war between the haves and have-nots in post-liberalisation India. With gay sex as a steamy backdrop, the topic becomes even trickier. “Rs 4,500 is a ridiculously low amount of money. To succumb to sexual demands for such a paltry sum is not possible, to say nothing of how unfair it is. The incident has sent shock waves in the gay community and while nobody deserves to get murdered, one cannot push the limits with such matters in milieus such as these. This was a poor fellow from Versova village who was being pushed to the wall,” says the same source, who has moved from managing multiplexes to working at a reputed film studio.If Patil found himself imperilled for demanding sexual favours from colleagues, Murli Gehani, a 52-year-old garments exporter, was a victim of excessive liberation. With his wife and kids in, Gehani enjoyed unlimited privacy in his apartment off Juhu-Versova Link Road. “The abandon was notorious among the community - gang -bangs, threesomes, even S&M evenings - the kink had much currency in Gehani’s love nest. Men from the slums of Mankhurd and Behrampada were often welcome to add further variety to a cast that changed every night, with ‘Mike’, as was his chatroom alias in the gay world, playing director,” says Dinesh (name changed to protect identity). The drama ended when Gehani’s throat was slashed. He was found almost 12 hours later. Broken beer bottles and condoms strewn on the floor were tell-tale signs of an orgy; the post-mortem, revealing that Gehani had enjoyed some anal sex, made it a definitive case of gay crime, with shantytown inhabitants finding themselves at an orgy that was also meant to double up as a heist.It doesn’t take strangers to get you to find yourself at the wrong end of a sharp knife though. Cash between contemporaries can also be a killer combination, and casually engaging neighbours from a lower socio-economic stratum equally hazardous in pink Mumbai, if you don’t know where to draw the line. Makeup artist Ruzario D’Souza, who earned his time under the sun for having dabbed on rouge onto Maria Goretti, Malaika Arora Khan and Mini Mathur, had his throat slashed and his chest stabbed several times. The culprit: Naresh Narkar, a co-makeup man who also doubled up as a gigolo. D’Souza had defaulted on fees of over Rs. 50,000 for five lovemaking sessions, i.e. Rs. 10,000 per night. D’Souza, he claimed, had devoured him but conveniently forgotten the costs involved, an amnesia that ignited immeasurable fury in Narkar.Barely a month later in the same year, 2006, Hiraji Meher, a 45-year-old laboratory supervisor from, was stabbed to death by his own ‘students’; the laboratory supervisor had an orchestra of electronic pianos that found good use at marriage functions in the vicinity, organs that found even better function at night, after hours. The ersatz pianist would lure boys from poor families into ‘Casio lessons’, promising them internships in the studios of established Bollywood music directors. The lessons would extend into porn-watching sessions and a natural consequence of such riyaz: orgy. On October 18, 2006, Meher’s Casio tuition classes hit the wrong note, screeching to a bloody. He invited boys from Satpati, a fishing village in the neighbourhood. After drinking copious sums of alcohol and watching blue films together, Meher began adamantly demanding sexual favours from the boys. Meher succumbed to stab injuries.In a milieu where same-sex love is illegal in our society, outlets for gay men are startlingly limited in maximum city. For the closeted segment, the openings for sexual release are even thinner, leading to dangerous frustration. Homosexuals, sometimes out of desperation (or perhaps even lack of character) cross a precarious class divide in an exploitative manner, occasionally even resorting to harassment.
