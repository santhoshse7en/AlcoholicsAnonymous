BOOZE RUINS LIVES!,â€œTHE wake-up call for me should have been the day a bullet blew my hat off.â€�.,Jabu Kumalo,2018-08-15T14:30:02.000Z,DailySun,"â€œTHE wake-up call for me should have been the day a bullet blew my hat off.â€� These were the words of Mussolini Shumi, who has managed to stop drinking thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He told Daily Sun he sometimes couldnâ€™t believe he was still alive after all the drinking and criminal activities he was involved in. Speaking about the day he almost lost his life, Mussolini said: â€œWe were coming back from a soccer match between Chiefs and Sundowns when we decided to rob a guy. â€œThere were four of us and we thought he was an easy target because he was with a woman. â€œAs we tried to grab him, he pulled out a gun and fired at us. The first bullet hit my friend and severely injured him. â€œWe scattered all over the place and he kept on shooting. I felt my hat leaving my head as it was hit by a bullet. â€œEvery time I think about that moment, I sweat a bit.â€� Mussolini said they later learned the man was a soldier. He said thanks to AA, he was happy to say he no longer lived a rough and dangerous life. To show his gratitude, Mussolini and some members of his AA group in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, will be holding a rally this Saturday. He said the aim of the imbizo was to spread the message to those still ruled by alcohol that there was hope for them. The imbizo will be held at Tsolo Hall on Makau Street from 9am. The venue is close to the well-known Change Bible Church. Mussolini, who has been sober for 10 years, said: â€œAfter being involved in two car accidents while driving a company car, I knew I needed help or I would die. â€œI decided to tell my employers the truth and was booked into rehab. When I came out, I joined AA and the past 10 years have been pure bliss.â€�Mussolini said anyone who thinks they might have a drinking problem should attend the event to find a solution.",{},"['aa', 'booze', 'hit', 'lives', 'decided', 'involved', 'ruins', 'imbizo', 'day', 'drinking', 'mussolini', 'thanks', 'hat']","He told Daily Sun he sometimes couldnâ€™t believe he was still alive after all the drinking and criminal activities he was involved in.

NAIR MAY GO FOR MENTAL HEALTH CHECK!,HE called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video.,Sun Reporter,2018-10-02T09:34:03.000Z,DailySun,"HE called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video.And now the Verulam Family Court is expected to make a ruling on Tuesday on whether Kessie Nair can apply for bail or be sent for mental observation before applying for bail.State prosecutor Carlson Govender and Nair's attorney Chris Gounden submitted their final arguments on Monday afternoon on the state's application that Nair be sent for a 28-day mental assessment at Fort Napier Hospital in Pietermaritzburg.Nair - the former Durban councillor and convicted fraudster who called President Cyril Ramaphosa the k-word in a widely circulated Facebook video - has been charged with six counts of crimen injuria and two of incitement of public violence.Govender argued that Nair should be treated as an in-patient at Fort Napier.He said the court should consider the evidence of a district surgeon who examined Nair on the day of his first court appearance, the evidence of Nair's brother Krishnan and that of the investigating officer Warrant Officer Ajay Lutchnan.The district surgeon had found that Nair showed no signs of mental illness but recommended that he should be sent to Fort Napier for 28 days, the court heard.Krishnan told the court that he noticed ""changes"" in Nair's mental state when he visited him at Westville prison on ""numerous occasions"".Lutchnan told the court that there was a time when he couldn't understand what Nair was saying when he took his fingerprints on the day of his arrest.Lutchnan said they had interacted about Nair's time in prison and about Nair ""belonging to a 26 section of the prison"".However, Gounden hit back at the state's witnesses.""The district surgeon is incompetent to do a mental observation, has no qualifications to deal with someone's mind and lacked expertise to make such an assessment. The district surgeon recommended that the accused be sent to Fort Napier but found that he had no signs of mental illness, which is contradictory,"" argued Gounden.His said Krishnan's evidence should not be considered because ""he can't manage his own affairs"" and had also ""sought assistance"".Krishnan had admitted in court that he was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous but said he had been clean for two and a half years.Gounden also argued that Nair should have been summoned to appear in court instead of being arrested.

He lived with his gogo in the Eastern Cape.Â After his gogo died, young Xolani lived with his uncle. But soon his life spiralled out of control and he started a life on the streets.â€œI became addicted to nyaope. I was arrested and sentenced for using and selling drugs,â€� he said.Â He spent five years in prison and lost his leg to bone cancer. When he left prison, he lived under a bridge for seven years, still addicted to nyaope.Then, on 26 April 2016, his life changed when he met Hein Venter, who gave him a second chance. Venter was driving home one night and saw Xolani. He was moved to help him.Xolani went to rehab and attended Alcoholics Anonymous.Â â€œVenter means everything to me.

Clandestine sex industry booms in Rohingya refugee camps,"â€œAt least 500 Rohingya sex workers are living in Kutupalong,â€� says Noor, who works as a fixer",Thomson Reuters Foundation,2017-10-24T11:28:25+06:00,Dhaka Tribune,"Rumors Slipping into prostitution Safe spaces As Rohingya women struggle to access even the very basics such as food and water in Bangladeshâ€™s overcrowded camps, a flourishing sex trade offers cash in times of desperation. Four women entered the clean-swept mud hut, took off their black shawls and sat cross-legged on the floor. When asked if they sold sex, the women stirred uncomfortably and were silent. Later, after cups of tea, the question came up again. The women caught each otherâ€™s eyes. Slowly one of them walked across the room to shut the door, another blocked the window. Darkness fell in the small, humid hut and voices turned to whispers. â€œIf anyone finds out what we do, they will kill us,â€� murmured 26-year-old Romida. More than 600,000 ethnic Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, have fled attacks by the Myanmar army since late August, fleeing across to border to southern Bangladesh in the worldâ€™s fastest growing refugee crisis. In Kutupalong, the biggest camp, the sex industry is thriving. Many of the sex workers are longer term residents of the Bangladeshi camps, but the influx of tens of thousands more vulnerable women and girls is expected to fuel the trade. â€œAt least 500 Rohingya prostitutes live in Kutupalong,â€� said Noor, who works as a fixer, but many have lived for years in the camp which was established in 1992. â€œRecruiters now have their eyes set on the newcomers,â€� she added. UN agencies say they have no figures on the numbers of sex workers in the camps to make public. â€œItâ€™s hard to come by numbers and we donâ€™t collect data on how many sex workers are in the camps,â€� Saba Zariv, an expert on gender-based violence at the UNâ€™s population agency UNFPA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.A recent report from UNICEF, the UN childrenâ€™s fund, said that in the chaotic, unorganised camps, children and youths could fall prey to traffickers and people looking to exploit and manipulate them. From tight-knit conservative Muslim communities, the Rohingya often turn a blind eye to prostitution. â€œPeople pretend that it doesnâ€™t exist,â€� said Noor. â€œThe girls meet their Bangladeshi clients outside the camps. They donâ€™t sleep with other Rohingya. Our communities are tight and rumours could spread easily. Each girl wants to appear pure.â€� Many of the prostitutes are children who eat no more than one meal a day and donâ€™t attend school. They work secretively without even their parents knowing. Rena, 18, who has lived in the camp for the past decade was forced to marry an alcoholic two years ago. â€œHe mistreated me and beat me,â€� she said. Her abusive husband left her when she gave birth to her first son. Feeding her child became impossible. â€œThatâ€™s when I decided to become a sex worker. I was only 16, but it was out of desperation. I needed money.â€� Fourteen-year-old Kamru, who also sells sex, arrived years ago in a previous wave of Rohingya refugees. She has never been able to attend school because her family is too poor. â€œThe camp is all I remember. I grew up here, but I was always hungry,â€� said the teenager, who like all the women and girls did not want to reveal her full name. Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the campâ€™s sex industry. â€œIf aid agencies canâ€™t manage to provide people with their basic needs, the risk of trafficking grows â€“ if we canâ€™t establish a sustainable mechanism here and aid tires out, we could see trafficking levels rise,â€� said Lisa Akero, gender protection specialist at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).Romida had been left hungry and malnourished and saw prostitution as the only way she could survive. â€œI told myself Iâ€™d do anything. I didnâ€™t have a choice.â€� Her first client was a Bangladeshi friend who convinced her to have sex with him for Tk1,000 Taka ($12). â€œHe paid good money,â€� she recalled. â€œThe going-rate is Tk200 ($2.50) and my fixer takes half of it.â€� The business largely operates by phone calls, with pimps informing the girls where to go and who to see. On average, Romida has three male clients a week - and darenâ€™t risk taking on more for fear of being found out. â€œI sometimes travel as far as Coxâ€™s Bazar city, which is a two hour drive. Whenever I leave the camp, I have to make up excuses. I pretend to be visiting relatives or taking a shift at the market.â€� The Rohingya women meet men of all backgrounds - from university students to local politicians. In a brief phone conversation, Ali, a 23-year-old Bangladeshi student told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he sleeps with prostitutes occasionally, but when he eventually marries he would expect his wife to be a virgin. Most clients donâ€™t use condoms, the women said. â€œI take birth control injections, but I worry about HIV every day,â€� said Romida. She has never been tested for sexually transmitted diseases.Half an hourâ€™s drive away from the muddy, chaotic camps, surrounded by green rice paddies, local charity Pulse has set up a safe house for refugees that can host up to 30 women. Due to open in the coming days, the dormitory-style apartment is newly refurbished and has a psychologist on site. â€œThe girls who come here might not want to talk about what is happening in their lives as they could be in danger,â€� said the shelterâ€™s manager Kurshida Aktar, adding that all vulnerable women are welcome: victims of rape, single mothers and sex workers. â€œWeâ€™re creating an opportunity for women to rebuild their lives, access basic needs, have an outlet to talk and receive job training,â€� said Aktar. But the four Rohingya women who agreed to speak to the Thomson Reuters Foundation were largely unaware of such services. â€œWe donâ€™t ask about it for fear of being found out,â€� said Kamru, the youngest of the girls. As she walks outside the house, she slips into her black burqa, covering all but her eyes. â€œI have to take it off when Iâ€˜m with my Bangladeshi clients,â€� she said. â€œBut in the camp itâ€™s my way to stay anonymous.â€�",{},"['booms', 'dont', 'clients', 'workers', 'camp', 'clandestine', 'camps', 'sex', 'refugee', 'women', 'industry', 'bangladeshi', 'girls', 'rohingya']","UN agencies say they have no figures on the numbers of sex workers in the camps to make public.

Alcoholic deaddiction awareness programme held at Vashi police stn,"Vashi:  A group of members of Alcoholic Anonymous (A A), a fellowship of men and women working for those who are willing to get rid of alcohol addiction, descen",Vashi:,None,Mumbai Mirror,"motivating talk: The AA members explained the primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety Vashi: A group of members of Alcoholic Anonymous (A A), a fellowship of men and women working for those who are willing to get rid of alcohol addiction, descended on Vashi police station on October 8 with the intention of spreading awareness among the policemen about the ill-effects of alcoholism. The members of AA aimed at achieving their primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety. They propagated their recovery programme to help the policemen to quit alcoholism, in case any of them was addicted to alcohol, and also help others in the society to quit alcohol, thereby helping them to lead a stress-free life which otherwise, due to alcoholism, adversely affects their family members. A member of Alcoholics Anonymous, on conditions of anonymity said, """"The AA recovery programme to help quit alcohol, we believe, will work for almost anyone who has a desire to stop alcohol consumption . It may work even for those who feel that they are prodded in the direction of AA. We have seen some alcoholics stumble for a while before getting on with the programme, but with repeated efforts, they have regained their senses and walked in the right path."""" SPI Raosaheb Sardesai of Vashi police station informed, """"We had conducted the training workshop for the police staff to help them understand the adverse effects of alcoholism. Hence, to achieve our goal we had invited the experienced members of the AA, who addressed the gathering of around 70 police staff comprising PIs, PSIs, APIs and the constabulary. The members propagated about the activities of the AA and the efforts taken by them to help alcoholics get rid of their addiction. The policemen like other individuals are not regular drinkers but still it is a necessity to instil within them a sense of responsibility towards the society. The awareness amongst the policemen will but naturally help them in tackling situations wherein they face people addicted to alcohol thereby enabling them to convince the alcoholics by explain them the methods of quitting alcohol, albeit gradually."""" Another member of AA, on conditions of anonymity emphasized, """"Early, in our association with AA, we heard about the Twelve Steps; of recovery from alcoholism, we learned that these steps represented an attempt by the first members to record their own progress from uncontrolled drinking to sobriety. We discovered that a key factor in this progress seemed to be humility, coupled with reliance on a power which is greater than ourselves. While some members preferred to call this power as God, we were told that this was purely a matter of interpretation. As we have grown in AA, our concept of a greater power has usually become more mature. But, it has always been our personal concept; no one has forced it upon us.â€� â€œExperience shows that alcoholics should, and can, learn to pace themselves. Live and Let live is one of the slogans of AA. When we first turned to AA, many of us had a number of serious problems involving money, family, job and our own personalities. However, we soon discovered that our immediate central problem was alcohol. Once we had that problem under control, we were able to make successful approaches to the other problems. Solutions to these problems have not always come easily, but we have been able to cope with them far more effectively when we were sober than we were able to do during our drinking days.""""

Preferably, with a nice glass of red, or maybe even something stronger. Husbands are not usually right, but your Mr-ji is perfectly within his rights to unwind this way. By your own admission, heâ€™s drinking only moderately, and only on weekends â€” and Iâ€™d bring even this estimation down a peg or two because in your paranoid state, you have probably exaggerated it. To me, he doesnâ€™t sound one bit like heâ€™s on the road to destruction, or even the nearest centre of Alcoholics Anonymous. Heâ€™s the one who has made the more sober analysis, namely, that if you continue â€œnagging, crying and fighting on this issueâ€� you will certainly drive him there. Just listen to yourself. You sound like a prissy, pursed-lip, holier-than-thou harridan. A domineering wife who thinks only she knows whatâ€™s good for her family, and everyone else is a weakling who would be ruined if you werenâ€™t there to â€˜saveâ€™ him. Why on earth should he get â€˜addictedâ€™? For your information, I know many more casual drinkers who havenâ€™t turned into alcoholic wrecks. Let me be brutally honest. Your problem is that you were once a busy professional doing an important job for society, but now that you are a homemaker, you need to justify your existence (take out your frustrations) by nagging everybody else. Hereâ€™s something to shake you out of your alcoholism-induced delusions: if you donâ€™t reform, your â€˜happy marital lifeâ€™ will indeed get â€˜spoiltâ€™, and the fault will most definitely not be your husbandâ€™s.

When lifeâ€™s on the rocks,"Over twenty-six million Indians drink more alcohol than they should. Are you one of them? If so hereâ€™s why you need to slow down, and how to do it.",Lachmi Deb Roy,None,Mumbai Mirror,"TWELVE STEPS TO RECOVERY AS PRESENTED BY ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS ByOver twenty-six million Indians drink more alcohol than they should. Are you one of them? If so hereâ€™s why you need to slow down, and how to do it.According to the WHO, across the world, alcoholism claims more lives per year than even AIDS, which takes it right to the top of the â€˜killer diseasesâ€™ list. Manmohan Taneja, Co-Founder of Wilson Smith Recovery Services (WSRS) which offers programmes to facilitate recovery from addictions, says, â€œAccording to a 2014 WHO report, which relied on a 2010 survey, approximately 30 per cent of the Indian population drinks alcohol; out of this 11 per cent are drinking at a harmful level, and approximately 2 per cent or 26.5 million people indulge in binge drinking.â€�This may come as no surprise, given the proliferation of watering holes in this city, but what should raise a red flag is Tanejaâ€™s revelation: less than 10 per cent of problem drinkers seek treatment.Roy V Tellis, who co-founded WSRS with Taneja is an alcohol abuse counsellor and a certified â€™12-step consultant.â€™ Heâ€™s also a recovered alcoholic. Now 56, Tellis shares his experience: â€œHaving grown up in a family where parties and drinking were regular weekend affairs, I had access to alcohol very early in life. As kids, I remember we were given a glass of shandy in all parties. That was the kind of exposure I was used to. One day, my friends and I went out trekking with two bottles of alcohol. We were just 16 years old. The booze made me feel terrific, and I didnâ€™t want to stop at that, so I went and brought some rum from a bootlegger. I donâ€™t even remember how I reached home that day. Later, I came to understand that I had had an alcoholic black out then.â€�Roy adds, â€œEventually, in college, I went from being a weekend drinker to a daily drinker. I couldnâ€™t concentrate on anything.â€�Consultant psychotherapist Azhar Hakim says, â€œIdeally, a person should not drink more than three pegs in one sitting, twice a week. Cross this limit and youâ€™re asking for health trouble.â€�Psychiatrist, Dr Tanay Maiti adds, â€œIf one wants to stop being an alcoholic, then he/she should not target complete abstinence from day one, or get frustrated if he/she relapses after a short period of abstinence. Sudden stoppage after a habit of regular drinking can cause various kinds of discomfort, even lead to medical emergencies, and this may drive you back to your previous pattern of heavy drinking.â€� Maiti highlights that alcoholics must remember the acronym â€˜HALT.â€™ â€œIt stands for Hunger, Anger, Loneliness, and Tiredness â€” these may work as triggers and lead to excessive consumption of alcohol, regular consumption or/and relapses.â€�Hakim says, â€œAlcoholism begins with alcohol dependence, i.e. when the person cannot do without alcohol. And one is so preoccupied with alcohol that one is constantly looking for occasions to consume it. As it progresses, one will continue to drink alcohol regardless of the financial or physical problems it causes.â€�He adds, â€œAlcohol dependency is experienced by 15 per cent of drinkers. It is incurable, but a fully treatable disease. Alcoholism is like diabetes. It is chronic and progressive. If left untreated, the problem worsens.â€�The reason that alcoholism remains unchecked is that, like with all addictions, addicts refuse to admit thereâ€™s a problem. Recovered alcoholic Raj Singh (name changed), a Colaba-based CA, says, â€œAt the age of 38, I refused to listen to anybody who said that I had a drinking problem. I was irresponsible and completely negligent towards my familyâ€™s welfare. I would gulp down eight to nine bottles of beer in an hour. I must have known this was crazy because I remember lying to people about the amount I was drinking. I used to sit around in bars from 5pm to four am. There were times when I did not go to work for months. I used to be violent at home, hit my wife and break things. Yet, for all of that, at the time, I couldnâ€™t see that I had a problem. One day, a friend dragged me to an AA meeting, and thatâ€™s when my journey of recovery began.â€�Chronic alcohol abuse poses many threats to oneâ€™s health and general wellbeing. Long term overconsumption causes brain cells to die and this in turn may lead to mental disorders. It can, of course, also cause liver damage and cirrhosis and inflammation of the pancreas or pancreatitis. Additionally, psychiatrist, Dr Maiti says, â€œOther than the body, the psyche also gets affected, leading to depression, poor anger management, impulsive disorders, and in many cases, it leads to an addiction to other substances.â€�Besides, the family of an alcoholic suffers through his or her addiction. Forty-seven-year-old advertising professional and resident of Parel, Shilpanjali Mehta (name changed to maintain anonymity), wife of a recovered alcoholic recalls, â€œI tried to control the situation, but it was crazy. I used to have to pick him up from bars late at night, and with a small baby at home, things were difficult. He used to land up drunk at every family occasion, be it a celebration or a funeral prayer â€” it was a huge social embarrassment, and aside from affecting his health, it was very distressing for all of us.â€�Shilpanjali shares, â€œI got in touch with Al-Anon (a group for family members of alcoholics). They taught me about the disease, and the three Cs: You have not caused it, you cannot control it, and you cannot cure it. That means you are totally powerless over another personâ€™s drinking. Understanding this releases you from the burden of guilt and self-pity. After multiple failed attempts and disappointments whenever I tried to get him to seek help from different sources, I started focussing on myself instead, on my career and my daughterâ€™s upbringing. I realised that I need to build my own life and be responsible for my own happiness.â€�--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Ever since he has taken over, he has been initiating many new moves to improve the police force and rid it of corruption.

I sympathise with the families of the fishermen who were killed. However, such episodes cannot entirely be blamed on merchant ships. As a chief officer on-board merchant ships, I have often seen fishing boats coming dangerously close to big ships. Ships, being heavy, are difficult to manoeuvre, so when the crew notices a boat coming in the path, they find it difficult to change course quickly. Moreover, with the piracy scare at coastlines, ships are forced to move closer to the western coast for safety, where such fishing incidents occur. Indian fishermen need to exercise more safety when they are out at sea. â€” Christopher Pereira Back up pride with performance This refers to Greatness, interrupted (MM, March 2). Sehwag is talented, aggressive and at times, he can change the course of a game. The unfortunate part is that he knows this, and, it seems, has allowed the knowledge to go to his head. Sadly, he does not have the runs right now to back his confidence. Sehwag needs to get back in form with a superb performance to prove himself worthy of his ambitions. â€” Mukund Kumar Made to wait for a bomb blast? This refers to RPF respond to bomb scare on train after wasting 20 minutes (MM, March 2). Imagine the state of the passengers on the train as they waited for 20 whole minutes, hoping against hope that the abandoned tiffin box was not a bomb. Is there no value of human life?

Heartbreak cure: Why you need to celebrate the present,Love is like a drug â€” romantic love causes changes in brain chemistry that are remarkably similar to the use of substances like cocaine and heroin;,How to Heal Your Broken Heart by Dr Shyam Bhat is available on the Juggernaut Books app for Android and iOS,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Love is like a drug â€” romantic love causes changes in brain chemistry that are remarkably similar to the use of substances like cocaine and heroin; and the experience of unrequited love is similar to the experience of an alcoholic or drug addict in withdrawal, unable to live without the substance, even while they know that the substance will harm them.Alcoholics Anonymous is a group that helps people get over alcohol addiction, and some of their guiding principles may also be applied to heartbreak. The most effective of the AA strategies, when it comes to heartbreak, is to have faith in a higher power, to know that something greater than yourself will restore you to peace and happiness.Itâ€™s very hard for us to have faith in ourselves. To have faith that things will turn out all right. To know that, one day, even this difficult and painful time will recede. When we face a life situation that we donâ€™t have solutions for, we can start feeling helpless and alone. We feel this way because, consciously and logically, we do not feel strong and complete.But the truth that you must remember, even in moments of pain and despair, is that you have a vast untapped potential and a deep wisdom that is guiding your conscious life. This internal compass and wisdom will lead you out of pain and into fulfilment, if you allow it to. Surrendering to a higher power is a way of tapping into the vast reservoirs of subconscious wisdom and strength.The times we feel weak and have lost faith in ourselves is when we most need faith. Ironically, faith in something larger than ourselves helps us unlock our own inner healing powers. And it doesnâ€™t matter if you are an atheist or a believer â€“ even the existence of God is not required for you to experience the benefits of surrender and faith.To know that you will be okay and that you will find happiness again is such a powerful belief that you will at once and immediately feel a sense of relief.Once you surrender to a higher power in this manner, you will find it easier to let go of the past and to live in the momentâ€˜The secret of health for both body and mind is not to mourn for the past, not worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly.â€™ â€” The BuddhaI can hear you say, â€˜How can I find peace in the present, when the present is full of pain?â€™ Yes, it isnâ€™t easy to live in the present moment, when you are hurting. But consider your pain and the thoughts associated with your pain and you will find that your pain is not from the present, but from memories of the past and from worries about the future.If you forget about the past and let go of the worries of your future you will immediately begin to feel peace. This is easier said than done, of course, but I urge you to try because as you increase your depth of awareness of the present moment you will start feeling more and more peaceful.You can begin staying in the present moment and letting go of the past and the future by first focusing on your breath. Make sure that you breathe easily and steadily throughout the day. When we are tense, and stressed, we hold our breath. Our breathing becomes shallow and this pattern of breathing sends a signal to the brain that we are under stress. The stress then further tightens the breathing and so on, in a vicious cycle.Even though you may not be able to still the thoughts in your mind and your worries, you can break through the cycle of stress and find peace by first stilling your body.When you still and relax your body and relax your breathing, your mind will get the message that you are feeling safe and secure.Practise meditation in this manner once or twice a day to start increasing your awareness of the present moment. It will help you let go of the past, celebrate the future and enjoy the present moment.",{},"['know', 'need', 'heartbreak', 'peace', 'moment', 'faith', 'present', 'cure', 'celebrate', 'live', 'past', 'pain', 'future', 'feel']","To know that, one day, even this difficult and painful time will recede.

Joseph Pereira: Mumbai Heroes,"For 36 years now, Fr Joseph Pereira has been using yoga to rehabilitate addicts.",A Fatherâ€™s healing touch,None,Mumbai Mirror,"A Fatherâ€™s healing touch Father Joseph Pereira GETS MY VOTE For 36 years now, Fr Joseph Pereira has been using yoga to rehabilitate addicts.Kripa FoundationCuring innumerable people of their addictionsByAt the dormitory behind his office-cum-residence, Father Joseph Pereira, fondly known as â€œFather Joeâ€�, stops to assist a student trying out ardha halasana (half plough pose). To the casual observer, this may appear to be an ordinary yoga lesson, but this dormitory doubles as a rehabilitation centre, and 75-year-old Fr Joe is a healer and crusader, who has been fighting against addiction for 36 years.To this end, in 1981, he founded the Kripa Foundation, a modest facility on the premises of Mt Carmel Church, Bandra (W). Over the years, the centre has grown into one of the largest NGOs in the field of rehabilitation of chemical dependency and HIV/AIDS. Affiliated with the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Kripa now has 65 centres in 11 states, 16 archdioceses and dioceses, and collaborations in six countries.Fr Joe, who will complete 50 years of priesthood on September 23 and recently sought Pope Francisâ€™s blessings at the Vatican in Rome, continues to work hands-on. His unique rehabilitation model incorporates the asanas, postures and pranayama techniques he learnt from his yoga guru BKS Iyengar. A yoga practitioner for 49 years, Fr Joe believes that to cure addictions, the healing must involve the soul and the mind.â€œAbstinence is not always enough. People who give up alcohol or drugs may develop addictions to sex, gambling, money, power, pornography or other things. The Kripa Foundation therefore aims to change the addictâ€™s lifestyle through a holistic approach. Thatâ€™s where, yoga comes in,â€� said Fr Joe, who has worked closely with Mother Teresa.Several reformed addicts have stayed on at his centres, taking on positions in administration or working on rehabilitation projects.â€œOne of my students, a well-known industrialist, has been sober for 19 years. Another gentleman, whom I found in a desperate state at Asha Daan (a home founded by Mother Teresa), 22 years ago has not tasted liquor since,â€� added Fr Joe, whose work has won him the Padma Shree and the National Award from the President of India. A former trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, he has written several books and research papers on deaddiction and yoga.In the 1980s, when he was appointed the head of Mt Carmel Church, a part of Bandra was being reclaimed and the fishing community was hit hard. â€œPeople lost their jobs and it led to the rise in alcoholism. It troubled me deeply and I was determined to do something about it.â€�Then one day, he visited Asha Daan and saw some young addicts on the verge of death. â€œMother Teresa told me that one of them had served as an Air Force pilot. Determined to guide them away from their addictions, I appealed to the Archbishop Cardinal Simon Pimenta and though it took some convincing, he gave me permission to run the de-addiction centre from the church premises for a year. Ultimately, he was so impressed he said â€˜Joe, I believe you are doing Godâ€™s workâ€™.â€�Today, the Kripa Foundation treats over 1,000 addicts annually and also offers care and support to the HIV-affected (it has rehabilitated close to 1,500 children grappling with the disease). â€œPeople come to Kripa because it follows Mother Teresaâ€™s ethos.

"If I didn't quit now, I'd have drank myself to the grave: Pooja Bhatt",Pooja Bhatt opens up on her battle with the bottle and how she reclaimed herself.,On Christmas I went to bed sober,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Pooja Bhatt alcohol Mahesh Bhatt Sanjay Dutt Narayan Niyogi Anupam Kher Alia Bhatt Filmfare Best Actress Award opens up on her battle with the bottle and how she reclaimed herself.Today is the 68th day and Pooja Bhatt hasnâ€™t touched a drop ofsince she pulled the plug on December 24. Sheâ€™s gone through Christmas and New Year and even brought in her 45th birthday on February 24 without a drink. Talking about her battle with the bottle openly in the public space is part of her catharsis.â€œI want to bust the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because itâ€™s a matter of shame for the family. We donâ€™t share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer,â€� says Pooja, admitting that in her case it was a chat with her father that led to this decision.On December 21,messaged her from Delhi and they got talking about the state of the country, about leaders who in their eagerness to imprint their footsteps in the sands of time create absolute mayhem. As he was ringing off, he told her, â€œI love you kid.â€� She responded, â€œI love you too pops. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, there is nothing else worth loving in the world.â€� He replied, â€œIf you love me then love yourself because I live in you.â€�Her father had never alluded to her problem, but the text urging her to love herself, struck a chord. Pooja promised him that â€œfrom this moment Iâ€™m going to be the best â€˜meâ€™ Iâ€™m capable of beingâ€� and after putting down the phone wondered if going out with someone and polishing off a bottle of whisky was loving herself. The answer was a resounding â€˜noâ€™.On Christmas Day, the Bandra girl who is Christian by faith, put her phone on silent and sat in her apartment with her four cats listening to the strains of â€œSilent Nightâ€� wafting in from somebodyâ€™s home. â€œI ate dinner and went to bed at 11.40 pm, sober. At midnight I heard the bells of the four churches ring and felt rejuvenated,â€� she exults.She took off for a holiday to Lahore, to Delhi, to several places. And while in the past sheâ€™d spent evenings alone, with a bottle of wine, in some cafÃ©, watching the world go by, this time, she stayed away from the wine. Not just through Christmas but even the drunken revelry of New Year.The public pressure escalated as her birthday neared. She toyed with the idea of taking one drink. â€œBut then I asked myself if I needed it, and if I did, why stop with one glass? Why not drink the whole bottle of champagne because as somebody said, â€˜One drink is had with the enemy.â€™ I called my friends to my farm, we swam at 2 am, we did many fun things, but I didnâ€™t drink,â€� she smiles.Sheâ€™d smoked her first cigarette at 23 and has never done cocaine. But she was drinking by the time she was 16. Growing up in an Anglo-Indian environment, it was normal for wine to be passed around the table and beer opened on Sunday. Even in the film industry there were people drinking copiously.â€œAlcohol is comforting, it colours your evening. Itâ€™s a socially accepted narcotic even at business lunches and in the boardroom. Also, living in a fast-paced city, being in a high-stress profession, it becomes a reason to celebrate and cope with failure. Your film is a hit, you bathe in champagne, it flops, a single malt lessens the pain,â€� she avers.Two years ago, Pooja ended her marriage. Though the end of a 10-year relationship is akin to death, she did not give herself time to mourn. She moved on, and the world said cheers to her spirit and energy. â€œBefore I knew it, itâ€™s a whirlwind of hedonism,â€� sighs Pooja who can drink every man in the room under the table thanks to her Scottish genes and her fatherâ€™s genes. â€œI was born to a man who has never done anything in half measures and I inherited that. So when I drank, I drank copiously. Your appetite increases even as the alcohol does terrible things to your body, clutters your mind and colours your judgement of the people youâ€™re hanging out with.â€�One evening, in the middle of another mindless conversation, she asked herself if sheâ€™d be sitting there without the alcohol. The answer was another â€˜Noâ€™ and it was time for some soul searching!Sheâ€™d seen what alcohol did to her father, how it had killed her parentsâ€™ marriage. Sheâ€™d been in relationship with an alcoholic and got her into the news. Sheâ€™d lost a friend at 40 to alcohol and had a drink to mourn her. But all this while, it was someone elseâ€™s problem, she was in control. This time, as her father had urged, she looked into the mirror unflinchingly and acknowledged she had a problem too.â€œI was 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which had got watered down,â€� says Pooja.She was in Delhi recently sharing the stage withwho admitted heâ€™d been a shy kid and drinking had made it easier for him to talk to a girl. Poojaâ€™s never been shy or short on confidence. For her drinking was a way of deflecting reality till she became a victim of what she calls mindless drinking.â€œLuckily, I pulled the plug before it became impossible for me to stop. Iâ€™m in the pink of health except for the weight I put on because Iâ€™m now a stressful producer. But being the daughter of an alcoholic makes you four times more susceptible to becoming one,â€� she says.She didnâ€™t need to go to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) as she had strong support systems in her dad and her Cabaret director Kaustav (). Years ago, Mahesh Bhatt had picked up his younger daughter, Shaheen and the child had moved her head away. That day he quit drinking and never went back even though as you see in the climax of Daddy, one night after returning from the shoot and pouringa drink, he was tempted to take one too after everyone had left and Pooja was asleep. He asked himself whoâ€™d know and realised that he could lie to the world but not himself. He would know! â€œI didnâ€™t think that the girl whoâ€™d counselled her father in Daddy would one day council herself,â€� Pooja says poignantly.Kaustav quit drinking two years ago because if anything went wrong on the Cabaret sets, he didnâ€™t want anyone to blame it on his drinking. â€œNo one thought he could stay 24 hours without alcohol but he proved them wrong. â€œFor me these two are shining examples, who understand without me telling them anything,â€� she says, but agrees for many others, institutions like AA are necessary. â€œThere are many who want you to fail. Strangers are more supportive than some of your own because your battle makes them realise that they have failed,â€� she points out.Today, Pooja herself has no problem being around anyone who drinks. She has a fully stocked bar at home and even pours out drinks for friends. â€œIf I canâ€™t be around alcohol and resist it, it means Iâ€™m not in control.

BMC killing cityâ€™s social institutions in one big swoop,"Over 100 NGOs face shut down, even as BMC allows IB courses & coaching classes to be run from its schools.",Iconic institutions hit,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Over 100 NGOs face shut down, even as BMC allows IB courses & coaching classes to be run from its schools.The civic authorityâ€™s decision to reclaim municipal classrooms rented out to non-profit groups is threatening to derail the cityâ€™s entire social-work setup.More than 100 organisations engaged in diverse social-work realms - from empowering the disabled, tackling addiction to providing free medical care - currently run their centres in municipal schools across Mumbai. All of them have been given eviction orders by the BMC over the past three months.These include some of the countryâ€™s best help groups such as Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deafblind, Cancer Aid and Research Foundation and Alcoholics Anonymous.The reason: civic authorities have ruled that only NGOs and charitable organisations carrying out â€œeducational activitiesâ€� will be allowed to use municipal classrooms at a nominal rent.The new policy for the use of spare municipal classrooms - there are 626 across the city - will force many social-help groups not engaged in formal teaching to find alternative premises by paying exorbitant rents or temporarily suspend their operations. â€œIf the BMC enforces the policy, it will kill the cityâ€™s social institutions,â€� citizen corporator Makrand Narvekar said.But even as the BMC tries to push out non-profit organisations that do not fall in its arbitrary classification of educational groups, it is allowing commercial coaching classes to operate in municipal schools. Some, in fact, have turned public schools for poor students into full-fledged international schools that charge hefty fees for admission.The city administration took the call to â€œreclaimâ€� rented-out classrooms three months ago following an uproar in the state assembly over misuse of space in municipal schools.Congress legislator Alka Desai and Lok Bharti Party legislator Kapil Patil raised the issue, prompting an admission from Minister of State for Urban Development Uday Samat that BMC classrooms had been leased out to â€œnon-educational organisationsâ€�.Instead of ordering a crackdown on organisations that use the space solely for commercial gain, the state government directed the BMC to evict NGOs and charitable groups not carrying out educational work.Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Deafblind, Cancer Aid and Research Foundation and Alcoholics Anonymous - all of which run their centres in municipal schools in Byculla - were served with eviction orders in the past three months.While some of the social-help groups may not face difficulty in relocating, organisations like Helen Keller will be severely affected. The institute, founded in 1977, occupies 11 classrooms on the ground floor of a Byculla municipal school on NM Joshi Marg - the space it rented in 1979. It started off with just three students, but now has 115 students, adults and children, with vision and hearing difficulties.They are taught basic life and work skills â€“â€“ from reading Braille, making jute bags to using animation software. Over the past 34 years, it has trained thousands of such students in need of special care. The BMC sent an eviction notice to the iconic institution in June, saying it needed the classrooms to implement the Right to Education programmes.The institute argued that Mumbai lacked alternative infrastructure to accommodate students with multiple disabilities, and requested the BMC to reconsider. Officials, however, said the organisationâ€™s efforts didnâ€™t qualify as educational work and asked the management to move out.â€œThe disability of students is so complex that regular classroom dynamics donâ€™t work. Since most of them are deaf blind or have multiple disabilities, only one-teacher one-student interaction works,â€� Devyani Hadkar, coordinator of the instituteâ€™s Computer Education and Academics, said.Hadkar added: â€œWe donâ€™t offer them formal education since they wouldnâ€™t be able to comprehend it. Much of their initial education is based on acquiring basic life skills, followed by social and work skills.â€�Cancer Aid and Research Foundationâ€™s offices are also located in the same Byculla municipal school. The foundation, set up in 2001, sponsors treatment of hundreds of poor patients diagnosed with cancer. To date, it has spent Rs 13 crore.The foundation was served with an eviction notice in July, and it has time till December. â€œIt was a shock. We are a non-profit organisation, and have helped thousands of patients in the city,â€� said co-founder Rashida Kazi.She added: â€œWe have 84 employees and we occupy five rooms by paying nominal rent. Moving to another place in south Mumbai will be very expensive. Funds that can be used to help the poor will be wasted on rent.â€�The foundation feels instead of forcing reputed NGOs out, authorities should take action against sham social-help groups that enjoy concessions from the BMC. â€œThe BMC should support organisations that are doing good work for society,â€� she said.A civic official said the BMC had no doubts about the foundationâ€™s credibility, but the new policy didnâ€™t allow non-educational groups to occupy classrooms. â€œWe are just implementing the governmentâ€™s orders. We donâ€™t have the power to make exceptions,â€� the official said. â€œThere are many other organisations that are doing quality social work, but they will also have to vacate classrooms.â€�Alcoholics Anonymous, the international organisation devoted to help problem drinkers kick the bottle, has also been asked to move out of a municipal school in Meghraj Sethi Marg, Byculla. Three rooms on the English medium schoolâ€™s ground floor have been the organisationâ€™s Indian head office for the past 21 years.Arun S, from Alcoholics Anonymousâ€™ Mumbai unit, said the groupâ€™s work was nothing less than imparting education. â€œWe are not involved in any commercial activity. We have a long-standing reputation and it has helped thousands of drinkers to overcome the habit,â€� he said.The organisation uses the three classrooms to print its de-addiction literature in 15 Indian languages. The rooms also house the organisationâ€™s national helpline. â€œWe have made a representation before BMC, requesting them to consider ours as a special case,â€� he said.But Manoj Kotak, chairman of the civic bodyâ€™s education committee, hinted that it was unlikely to provide any relief. â€œThese NGOs are not using classrooms for teaching. Also, they pay very little rent. The BMCâ€™s norms are clear, and we cannot provide concessions to anybody,â€� he said.The reclaimed classrooms will be used to implement RTE programmes and also set up libraries.While non-profit groups are facing eviction, private organisations are being allowed to misuse municipal classrooms. A four-storey building in Dongri once housed Walpakhadi Municipal School. But in 2005, it was rented out to South Bombay Public Charitable Trust, which opened Fazlani Lâ€™Academie Globale School.The school was given permission to run 28 classrooms, but a BMC audit revealed that it had made illegal alterations and opened 48 rooms.Another private group, Old Student Association, allegedly runs commercial coaching classes from a municipal school in Nagpada. Authorities had rented out the premises to the association for a reading and guidance room for poor students, but it later started classes for entrance exams, local activists claim.Additional Municipal Commissioner Mohan Adtani said the BMC would review all such cases before forcing organisations to vacate civic schools. â€œNGOs that are doing credible work should be provided some leeway,â€� he said.Citizen corporator Makrand Narvekar said the civic body should revise its policy. â€œWhat is the use of a policy that is anti-people?â€�",{},"['citys', 'bmc', 'students', 'swoop', 'groups', 'municipal', 'social', 'schools', 'school', 'organisations', 'work', 'ngos', 'institutions', 'killing', 'classrooms', 'big']","â€œIf the BMC enforces the policy, it will kill the cityâ€™s social institutions,â€� citizen corporator Makrand Narvekar said.But even as the BMC tries to push out non-profit organisations that do not fall in its arbitrary classification of educational groups, it is allowing commercial coaching classes to operate in municipal schools.

Unwilling or unable?,"Why do men get 'too tired' for sex? Initial brainstorming with several women yielded these gems: ""He's a chronic masturbator""; ""He's secretly gay""; ""He has perf",When he has a sexual dysfunction,None,Mumbai Mirror,"Why do men get too tired for sex? Initial brainstorming with several women yielded these gems: ""Hes a chronic masturbator""; ""Hes secretly gay""; ""He has performance anxiety""; ""Hes found God""; ""As long as he isnt getting it elsewhere, we can both be celibate"" and ""He cant get it up and is pretending hes exhausted"". Several factors can bring a mans engines to a sputtering stop and he may not necessarily have found solace in another womans bed (but run over our checklist below, just to make sure!).Sexual dysfunction can be defined as a variety of problems from arousal (like, impotence - failing to achieve or maintain an erection) to desire (like, lack of interest in sex) and fear of intimacy. Since so many options are now available for the treatment of ED, disorders caused by a number of factors must be assessed when treating sexual dysfunction: psychological issues, childhood problems, sexual history, marital stability and communication, mood disorders or emotional problems and a history of sexual abuse.When his workload piles up too high, sex often slides into second, third or no place. Stress is probably the major cause of loss of desire in most males. De-stressing is important. Women are socialised to believe men want sex all the time. So when he doesnt always feel horny, women feel personally rejected. An honest conversation is required, or else youll wear out your vibrator and start looking around for another man.Erections are about blood engorging the penis. So, diabetics often face ED owing to the changes induced in the penis by high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high glucose. Additionally, some of the medicines used to treat these conditions can also cause ED. Diabetics normally dont lack a desire for sex, but their ability to perform is reduced. Physical factors like fatigue, chronic illnesses, hormonal imbalances and nerve damage are common causes for a sudden disinterest in sex. So, dont sit on uncertainty. Its important to rule out underlying medical causes for his inability to rise to the occasion. Some common emotional causes of ED are anxiety, depression, anger and sexual ignorance. Furthermore, being overweight, taking pills for blood pressure, tranquillisers or anti-depressants can all reduce sexual desire and performance too. A person may be depressed and not be aware of it. Consult a counsellor.After a night of heavy drinking, the only thing one wants to do in bed is sleep. As Shakespeare says of alcohol in Macbeth: ""...it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance..."" Basically, alcohol inhibits the inhibitory neurons and the individual acts more spontaneously. It therefore increases sexual desire initially - but alcohol also reduces the ability to perform, thereby leading to ED. Stop the cycle of sexless nights! If his drinkings getting out of hand, look up Alcoholics Anonymous. Drug abuse, too, can cause sexual problems. Get him rehab help.All cases of dysfunction are not extreme. Seema (names changed), 28, says her sex life took a nose-dive when her husband developed a fear of making her pregnant. ""So I started taking my pill at the breakfast table, and I think that reassured him."" Riya, 31, says her boyfriend used to have performance anxiety, so they limited themselves to oral sex until he was comfortable enough to go all the way. ""He got over it,"" she smiles, ""so women neednt think its all over forever if there are some dry spells."" Performance anxiety is a common problem in men with both short- and long-term erection failures.If a couple has other problems in their relationship - disagreements about money, child-rearing or domestic roles - the resentment may creep into the bedroom. Also, when a man can predict every move his partners going to make, or when intercourse is relegated to the same time-slot (every Tuesday and Saturday, straight after the late TV news and always in the bedroom!), the prospect of intercourse is often less than thrilling. So what can you do if your bedrooms become a bored-room? Address the relationship problems which have led to the sexual stagnation - either through honest communication, professional counselling, self-help books and weekends away together or apart.",{},"['performance', 'problems', 'unable', 'sex', 'women', 'ed', 'desire', 'anxiety', 'hes', 'sexual', 'high', 'unwilling']","So, diabetics often face ED owing to the changes induced in the penis by high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high glucose.

How to deal with teen drinking,"A growing band of liberal-minded parents feel teen drinking is no big deal. But hereâ€™s why it must be nipped in the bud, and how to do it.",Ananya Sengupta,None,Mumbai Mirror,"World Health Organisation Puducherry Rajasthan Maharashtra ByA growing band of liberal-minded parents feel teen drinking is no big deal. But hereâ€™s why it must be nipped in the bud, and how to do it.Every Saturday, 47-year-old Sujata Joshi (name changed) turns into a bundle of nerves. It is the time of week when her 20-year-old daughter, Sargam, goes out with her friends.â€œThe moment I hear her planning her weekend outing, I start getting palpitations. Her idea of fun is to go out drinking with her friends,â€� says Joshi, a single parent â€” her husband passed away three years ago â€” based in Andheri. â€œWill she be okay? Will she come home and embarrass me in front of her grandparents? These are some of the questions that keep going through my mind all day,â€� she says.Sargam, who is on medication for clinical depression, started drinking when she was 17 years old, Joshi tells us.Teens hitting the bottle is a rising trend in urban India. According to a recentstudy, 70 per cent of boys and girls under the age of 15 in the country have already had their first taste of alcohol.Experts, however, put the onus of alcohol addiction among teens squarely on the shoulders of the parents. â€œIn children, alcohol addiction can start as early as 13-15 yearsâ€� says psychiatrist and psychological counsellor Dr Pradnya Ajinkya. â€œItâ€™s caused by the inability to distinguish between right and wrong which is something that needs to be taught early on in life. Dysfunctional families, where parents do not spend enough time with their teens, families where each member spends more time on laptops and phones rather than talking to each other are more likely to spring alcoholics.â€�â€œFamilies must face the fact that alcohol addiction is a reality today,â€� Ajinkya says. â€œParents should consciously and deliberately take preventive measures. they must be on the lookout for signs of addiction if they suspect that their child consumes alcohol. And, they should take the time to do together, like go for outings.â€�Forty-seven-year-old Mitali Kamat who runs a skill development centre in Andheri, does just that. No less than a private investigator, she is relentless in her efforts to keep her two sons â€” 21-year-old Avanish and 11-year-old Shrish â€” away from the vice.â€œMy older son had his first Breezer when he was in Class X. I was shocked. Heâ€™s 21 now and I know he drinks. Lifestyles are so different nowadays. The kids go to a birthday party almost every weekend; and, of course, they drink there. He has friends who drink, and as a mother, I have no control over that,â€� says Kamat.As a parent, Kamat says, the only thing she can do is to keep telling her sons about the pitfalls of drinking and â€œleave the rest to Godâ€�. She also makes it a point to forward all drinking-related messages to her son, she tells us with a laugh, adding â€œI can only hope he reads them and takes some precautions.â€�For 45-year-old Deepti Gaekwad (name changed), a Mulund-based MNC executive, it was a culture shock when she found out that her 18-year-old daughter, Payal, would drink alcohol ever so often.â€œSince she was 15, she has gone through the whole gamut of binge drinking, throwing up, missing school and sleeping through entire days. For the longest time I ignored it, thinking the problem will just go away. Her life now is in tatters and I blame myself,â€� says Gaekwad, who checked Payal into a rehabilitation centre in the city after a drunk driving incident last year.The common denominator that binds these three women â€” Gaekwad, Joshi and Kamat â€” together is that all their families serve booze at social dos and children see the alcohol flowing freely into the glasses of their near and dear ones â€” they canâ€™t wait to start themselves.â€œEach time at a family gathering when Sargam is offered a drink, I silently pray that she refuses. She never does,â€� Joshi says. Kamat, on the other hand, finds it difficult to make her younger son understand why his brother is allowed to drink at family get-togethers while he is not.30-year old Parthiv â€” he prefers to share only his first name â€” tasted his first drink, â€œwhen my father offered me a glass when I was about 16.â€� Today, at 30, he struggles to stay on the wagon.â€œMy father told me that I could have a drink with him whenever I wanted to, and I need not do so on the sly. Since I was 16, I tasted a wide range of alcohol with him during weekends. Then, I would show off my experience with alcohol at parties and at gettogethers with friends, and for a short period in my life I was a hero, the gang leader,â€� says Parthiv, who now attends Alcohol Anonymous meetings twice a week in Mumbai. Heâ€™s had a failed marriage and a suicide attempt.â€œOne day it all came crashing down. I do not blame my father, but I often wonder if I would be the same man if he hadnâ€™t offered me that glass of vodka,â€� he says.Mumbai-based psychiatrist Dr Avinash De Sousa believes that parents as well as teens should understand that the ability to guzzle booze is not an accomplishment. And, allowing your teens to drink alcohol does not make you â€˜coolâ€™.â€œWhat it does, is give teens a false sense of self-esteem,â€� says Dr De Souza. â€œParents may demonstrate their liberal attitude in other areas. They must remember that a teenâ€™s brain is a still developing and once introduced, the craving for alcohol develops. This is a habit that should neither be introduced, nor cultivated by parents. It is simply hazardous behaviour.â€�But, for parents, it doesnâ€™t help that thereâ€™s no support group. Gaekwad says that she canâ€™t discuss her daughterâ€™s drinking with anyone.â€œThe mothers of all the other girls in my daughterâ€™s age or peer group do not seem to be aware of the problem. When I try to bring it up, they donâ€™t want to discuss it,â€� she says. She recognises the signs that her daughterâ€™s been drinking from her flushed appearance and â€œwhen she talks more than usual, and is generally sluggish.â€�Kamat lists other signs to look for: â€œloss of appetite, sudden weight loss or gain, a loss of interest in academics, a constant need for sleep and a lack of focus.â€�â€œI keep a keen eye on my boys. My younger one is 11 years old and I am more worried about him. I have restricted the time he spends outside the house and I keep talking to him about his friends and what he does when he is not home,â€� says Kamat, who has set an age limit of 18 years for her boys to taste alcohol.Gaekwad says, â€œIt may be oldschool, but the fact that my daughter drinks, disgusts me. At the same time, I do realise that drinking is now a part of life. My daughter prioritises her peer group over me. If I tell her anything, she has a standard answer â€” â€˜donâ€™t screw up my lifeâ€™.â€�In India, there is no uniform law related to legal age of drinking â€” it varies from state to state. While it is legal to drink alcohol at the age of 18 inand, the age-limit is 25 in Delhi. In, one can buy a bottle of whisky at the age of 18 but can consume it only if the person is above 25. The fact that thereâ€™s a law against it indicates that it isnâ€™t right, but the seemingly arbitrary restriction creates ambiguity about why it isnâ€™t right for teens to drink.Alcohol affects the structure and function of the developing brain. It alters the action of two major neurotransmitters and disrupts the communication between nerve cells and other cells of the body. This is what causes the sluggishness, the lethargy and slurred speech that drunk people experience. The hippocampus, important for memory and learning, and the prefrontal lobe which is responsible for planning, judgment, impulse control and decision making are particularly sensitive to alcohol in the teenage years. So, if youâ€™re still trying to figure out what age they should be allowed to drink at, the answer is clearly not at all before 18, and then, the later the better.",{},"['teens', 'drinking', 'age', 'joshi', 'parents', 'drink', 'does', 'deal', 'alcohol', 'kamat', 'teen', 'life']","World Health OrganisationPuducherryRajasthanMaharashtraByA growing band of liberal-minded parents feel teen drinking is no big deal.

There, she learned basic French, bonded with nature and made plenty of friends. Wed love to guarantee the 23-year-old that lunching at the newly migrated Soul Fry Casa might be the second best thing that happen to her, but refrain. Instead, the whole since youre Goan and the cuisine is Goan excuse seems to work very well. THE AMBIENCE Mendes cant seem to take her eyes of the little watering can by the fountain that stands at the landing between the upper and lower levels. When we point out that perhaps she could wash her hands there once the food is done, conversation is terminated for roughly five minutes. The cheerful Goan music playing in the background revived her spirits, however, and soon she waxed eloquent about its cheerful, warm interiors...the dark wood, the anonymous, peeling portraits on the wall and the chandeliers. ""They lend the interiors an older, sombre touch, balanced by the colourful decor and the happy, yellow, stone seating,"" she says. THE LURE Every regional cuisine has its peculiar stereotyped favourites, like Butter Chicken, Neer Dosa, Seekh Kebab, and were relieved that Mendes stays away from the Sorpotel and Vindaloo. She decides that the Prawn Loncha and Crispy Calamari make for decent enough starters, while the Prawn Xacuti, Dry Crab Rechad, Fish Ambotik (with a plate of white rice) form part of the main course. ""Ive never heard of a Prawn Thali,"" she says, tapping her chin with the index finger; and before it causes a dent, we choose to go in for the thali as well. For the alcohol inclined, the restaurant offers a choice between White or Red Wine (priced by the glass) and a selection of mocktails. Our jaws almost dropped however, when we requested a glass of Port and the waiter responded with, ""Whats that?"" THE FOOD The classic sweet-tooth syndrome forces Mendes to work backwards, beginning with dessert. ""Im a sugar-holic and Soul Frys version of the classic Goan dessert - bebinca was excellent. They make individual portions, served on a bed of caramel. The flavours were just right, as was the texture. The caramel, added an interesting dimension to it,"" she says. Mendes also recommends the Prawn Loncha and that pickle that goes with it. ""The seafood had lots of flavour,"" she says. (Of course, we had been warned that she is a strict fishetarain). The Fish Ambotiks tangy flavour complemented the white rice superbly and though we would have preferred to get messy with the Crab Rechad, it was yummy even in its de-shelled avatar. THE SERVICE ""This restaurant really understands what susegaad means to all Goans. Its probably one of the longest afternoon lunches Ive ever had. The waiters are pleasant and the service is fine, you just have to prepare yourself for a slow lunch,"" says the label-and-artist manager. THE VERDICT Located off the bustling Fort area, Soul Fry Casa makes for a lovely afternoon work lunch. Mendes takes (mild) exception to this saying that most people in the city refuse to invest so much time in food. ""It could work better as a respite for busy Colaba shoppers,"" she adds, helpfully. ""Yes, but on a slow Sunday afternoon when the world is mine and a long siesta is slotted inâ€¦"" You get the picture.

When Pink Turns To Red,"It seems like just another day in the lobby of Cinemax, a multiplex in Lokhandwala. Certainly not one to remind you that its 33-year-old manager, Mandar Patil,","Everyone in the theatre management circuit knew that Mandar was a queen, but nobody expected things to get this bad",None,Mumbai Mirror,"Cinemax multiplex Lokhandwala Versova industry murder Dubai Vartak Polytechnic College Vasai climax It seems like just another day in the lobby of, ain. Certainly not one to remind you that its 33-year-old manager, Mandar Patil, was found in a pool of his own blood with stab wounds on his head, neck and abdomen, dumped at an ice factory opposite a bus depot in. Homosexual intrigue was the cause. Patil, who was married a year ago, had been harassing a coffee vendor from the food and beverages department of Cinemax. Unlike the exorbitant prices of snacks at multiplexes, the vendors themselves are ironically strapped for cash, poorly paid chaps. â€œRs 4,500 is all he got, itâ€™s a measly sum. And he was getting steadily depressed with the sexual harassment being meted out to him at the hand of Mandar. Everyone in the theatre management circuit knew that Mandar was a queen, but nobody expected things to get this bad,â€� said a source, also gay, from the multiplexwho wished to remain anonymous given the shroud that already surrounds the homicide.The coffee vendor, Sreenath Jogi, and a couple of his friends took Patil out for drinks to the shebeen in Versova village where Patil and the object of his affection often downed drinks after work. The intent was to convince him to stop making sexual advances towards Jogi. By the time they got down to explaining, Patil was drunk and raucous, the men armed with weapons; the scene turned ugly. Patil was stabbed, but still alive. Then fearful that they would be caught, the men chose to make the scene look like a gruesomewith theft as motive, which it wasnâ€™t.The incident brings to light the perils of internalised oppression and how it can take on a frightening machismo that often brings to relief the fault lines of an unequal society. These blood-stained episodes send tremors through society, and both straight and queer quarters are squeamish when discussing the matter at hand because it reveals the constant tug of war between the haves and have-nots in post-liberalisation India. With gay sex as a steamy backdrop, the topic becomes even trickier. â€œRs 4,500 is a ridiculously low amount of money. To succumb to sexual demands for such a paltry sum is not possible, to say nothing of how unfair it is. The incident has sent shock waves in the gay community and while nobody deserves to get murdered, one cannot push the limits with such matters in milieus such as these. This was a poor fellow from Versova village who was being pushed to the wall,â€� says the same source, who has moved from managing multiplexes to working at a reputed film studio.If Patil found himself imperilled for demanding sexual favours from colleagues, Murli Gehani, a 52-year-old garments exporter, was a victim of excessive liberation. With his wife and kids in, Gehani enjoyed unlimited privacy in his apartment off Juhu-Versova Link Road. â€œThe abandon was notorious among the community - gang -bangs, threesomes, even S&M evenings - the kink had much currency in Gehaniâ€™s love nest. Men from the slums of Mankhurd and Behrampada were often welcome to add further variety to a cast that changed every night, with â€˜Mikeâ€™, as was his chatroom alias in the gay world, playing director,â€� says Dinesh (name changed to protect identity). The drama ended when Gehaniâ€™s throat was slashed. He was found almost 12 hours later. Broken beer bottles and condoms strewn on the floor were tell-tale signs of an orgy; the post-mortem, revealing that Gehani had enjoyed some anal sex, made it a definitive case of gay crime, with shantytown inhabitants finding themselves at an orgy that was also meant to double up as a heist.It doesnâ€™t take strangers to get you to find yourself at the wrong end of a sharp knife though. Cash between contemporaries can also be a killer combination, and casually engaging neighbours from a lower socio-economic stratum equally hazardous in pink Mumbai, if you donâ€™t know where to draw the line. Makeup artist Ruzario Dâ€™Souza, who earned his time under the sun for having dabbed on rouge onto Maria Goretti, Malaika Arora Khan and Mini Mathur, had his throat slashed and his chest stabbed several times. The culprit: Naresh Narkar, a co-makeup man who also doubled up as a gigolo. Dâ€™Souza had defaulted on fees of over Rs. 50,000 for five lovemaking sessions, i.e. Rs. 10,000 per night. Dâ€™Souza, he claimed, had devoured him but conveniently forgotten the costs involved, an amnesia that ignited immeasurable fury in Narkar.Barely a month later in the same year, 2006, Hiraji Meher, a 45-year-old laboratory supervisor from, was stabbed to death by his own â€˜studentsâ€™; the laboratory supervisor had an orchestra of electronic pianos that found good use at marriage functions in the vicinity, organs that found even better function at night, after hours. The ersatz pianist would lure boys from poor families into â€˜Casio lessonsâ€™, promising them internships in the studios of established Bollywood music directors. The lessons would extend into porn-watching sessions and a natural consequence of such riyaz: orgy. On October 18, 2006, Meherâ€™s Casio tuition classes hit the wrong note, screeching to a bloody. He invited boys from Satpati, a fishing village in the neighbourhood. After drinking copious sums of alcohol and watching blue films together, Meher began adamantly demanding sexual favours from the boys. Meher succumbed to stab injuries.In a milieu where same-sex love is illegal in our society, outlets for gay men are startlingly limited in maximum city. For the closeted segment, the openings for sexual release are even thinner, leading to dangerous frustration. Homosexuals, sometimes out of desperation (or perhaps even lack of character) cross a precarious class divide in an exploitative manner, occasionally even resorting to harassment. This is where the trouble begins for those who need it so badly.

One of the victims, Akshay Suresh Karpe (22), was also hit by a speeding vehcle. They were on their way to celebrate his birthday.Apart from Karpe, the other deceased has been identified as Imran Hussain Khan (25). Saddam Hussain Khan (22) survived the mishap and was admitted to KEM hospital with head injuries. According to Kalachowkey police, the victims, all residents of Govandi, were not wearing helmets.The incident was reported around 2.30 am. Khan, who was driving the Bajaj Pulsar, lost control over the two-wheeler and rammed into a divider on a sharp turn above Lalbaug Junction. The trio was headed to Girgaum, Chowpatty, where they wanted to spend the night. Afterwards in the morning, they planned to visit Siddhivinayak Temple to celebrate Karpeâ€™s birthday.The impact of the bike hitting the divider was so great that all three fell on the opposite side of the road when a private vehicle hit Akshay and sped off.Three of their friends were following them and they too fell but sustained only minor injuries. One of them was identified as Nitesh Ghoge (21). Khan and Karpe were taken to J J Hospital, were they were declared dead on arrival. The bodies were handed over to the families after post-mortem.Senior inspector Bhavsaheb Gite of Kalachowkey police station said, â€œWe have registered a case against Khan under Sections 304 (a) (causing death by negligence) and 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and various sections of the Motor Vehicle Act. A case has also been registered against the unknown driver. We are yet to ascertain if Khan had a valid license, as the family is grief-stricken. We will come to know on Wednesday if the rider was under the influence of alcohol or not. The bike belonged to Ghose, who was riding pillion.â€�Meanwhile, a pal of gloom descended on Gautam nagar, Govandi.

Serenity in the South China Sea,"The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of America's unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over.",Gareth Evans,2015-07-03T00:00:00+06:00,The Daily Star,"Diplomats and alcoholics dont always have as much in common as is sometimes assumed. But there is useful guidance for policymakers in the Reinhold Niebuhr prayer that Alcoholics Anonymous has made its own: â€œGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.â€� Americas response to Chinas rise â€“ and in particular to its assertiveness in the South China Sea â€“ is a case in point. The United States should accept many dimensions of Chinas economic, and now military, growth with as much serenity as it can muster. But there are some that call for pushback, and the jury is still out on Americas capacity to make the right calls. The central, painful reality that the US must accept is that a major shift in the Asia-Pacific balance of power has already taken place. The days of Americas unequivocal primacy and unilateral capacity to write the rules are over. Economically, the writing is on the wall. Despite US opposition to Chinas Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank, much of the region has embraced it. And, again despite US resistance, it seems inevitable that the renminbi will join the International Monetary Funds reserve-currency basket. Then there is the immense difficulty the US is having in bringing its China-excluding Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact to fruition. Militarily, while the US will remain the dominant global power for the foreseeable future, its absolute superiority in East Asia is no longer unchallenged. The dramatic build-up of Chinas military (especially naval) capability is no more than can be expected of a hugely trade-dependent regional superpower. It is not easy for some US leaders to say so publicly, but most acknowledge privately that America can no longer expect to have the seas and skies to itself. Its role will necessarily be scaled back to that of regional counterweight. But how far should serenity extend when it comes to the South China Sea? This is the most sensitive geopolitical issue looming over Xis state visit to the US in September. China has been stretching the limits of regional (and US) tolerance with its expansive sovereignty claims and massive land-reclamation activity â€“ some 2,000 acres in the last 18 months â€“ on Fiery Cross Reef and elsewhere. Pushback is required, but within defined limits. What critics of Chinas land reclamation need to understand is that, even without any credible sovereignty claims to the sea area in question, or any islands within it, under international law China does have the right to build artificial islands and installations, including airstrips, on outlying reefs and shoals. The Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have been doing so for years in the Spratly Islands, albeit on a smaller scale. Although such installations must be for â€œpeaceful purposes,â€� that does not necessarily exclude some military presence, provided the intent is non-aggressive. The US cannot stop such activity and should not try. What it can do is make clear that reclamation activity does not, by itself, provide a foundation for any new sovereignty claim or exclusionary activity. The reclaiming country can set a 500-meter â€œsafety zoneâ€� around such installations. That is all. China cannot claim a 12-mile territorial sea or a 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ); nor can it put in place an air defense identification zone or any other kind of military exclusion operation. And the US is within its rights to make this point by flying surveillance aircraft to within 500 meters of such installations. As for Chinas broader sovereignty claims, again some distinctions are necessary. To the extent that these claims are based on the â€œnine-dashed lineâ€� â€“ embracing some 80 percent of the South China Sea and described as Chinas â€œhistoric watersâ€� â€“ the entire international community should reject them out of hand. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) â€“ now generally accepted as customary international law even by countries that, like the US, have failed to ratify it â€“ is the only credible framework within which any kind of exclusive claims can be made. On the other hand, to the extent that Chinas claims are based on long use or occupancy of particular habitable islands in the Spratly or Paracel groups or elsewhere (and as such consistent with UNCLOS, to which China is a party), they may be as credible as those of other regional players, if not more so. So the US and other outsiders are right not to take sides about competing claims, and to urge that they be resolved by negotiation or international adjudication, not by force. Pending resolution of these competing claims, it is also appropriate, in the course of asserting the right to freedom of navigation, that the US and others treat as a de facto sovereign exclusion zone a 12-mile perimeter around such islands. After all, if they are not owned by China, they are owned by someone. As with the reef installations, the wise course is to minimise provocation. On the issue of freedom of navigation, China should be believed when it says that it is not in the business of obstructing commercial shipping or flights anywhere in the South China Sea. But it has created difficulties for the US â€“ and a continuing risk of inflammatory incidents â€“ by insisting that, within the entire 200-mile EEZ extending beyond its territorial waters, no military ship or aircraft has a right to engage in surveillance and intelligence collection. American pushback on this front, though justified, should be tempered. In the interest of defusing tensions, the US should scale back its monitoring activities within Chinas EEZs and rely more on less obviously intrusive means. Managing the US-China relationship in general, and the South China Sea in particular, requires, above all, keeping official rhetoric under control. Lines will need to be drawn, but wise leaders will focus on cooperative diplomatic solutions, playing military cards to the minimum extent possible â€“ and perhaps repeating to themselves, the AA serenity prayer before creating expectations that they cannot meet.

Mr. Karim has been on anti-hypertensive and oral hypoglycemic agents for 15 years and is known as a kind hearted and unassuming person by everyone who knows him. On physical examination Mr. Karim was alright with healthy vital signs. When asked how he was doing, Mr. Karim did not seem to be very well oriented with time, place or person. His speech was incoherent with frequent lapses in short time memory. When helped by his wife to answer questions, Mr. Karim became angry and reactive. In elderly patients like Mr. Karim, disorientation in time, place or person requires detailed history taking and evaluation. Two distinct patterns of disorientation are common; namely delirium and dementia. Both delirium and dementia are capable of causing aggressive behavior and thats why its important to have a fair idea of both. Dementia is characterized by profound memory loss which is usually short term and the patients are mostly elderly. Dementia is caused by organic diseases like Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and stroke. Delirium on the other hand is seen in both young and old patients. It may be described as acute mental confusion which may emerge due to a wide variety of reasons. Drug abuse and alcohol intoxication must be kept in mind while trying to manage a young patient who is delirious. If the patient is previously known to have chronic mental problems, aggressive or even violent behavior is always a possibility and medical staff must always be weary to tackle the situation with tact and efficiency. After all violent behavior is illegal outdoors just as much as it is illegal indoors. An approach to managing aggressive or violent behavior is outlined below: 1) It is good to assess the environment and to refrain from moving into the patients space until in a position of control. 2) All staff must react or communicate calmly and simply and take control of the patient gently. 3) All doctors, nurses and security staff should state their respective tasks firmly and simply. 4) Heroics can easily end up hurting the patient, family members or other staff and must therefore be absolutely avoided. 5) In case of a violent outburst an adequate number of staff to accompany the doctor. Six is ideal (one for immobilization of each limb, one for the head and one to assist with drugs) In most episodes of aggressive or violent behavior, it is good to remember that intra muscular drugs are practical. However, if verbal de-escalation has been achieved, oral and intra venous medications are excellent options as well. Oral drugs include diazepam and lorazepam. However such medications are contraindicated in patients with respiratory insufficiency. Under such circumstances, drugs like olanzapine or risperidone maybe given to the patient. Intravenous diazepam and midazolam are more potent then oral drugs if the patient can be convinced to cooperate with the hospital staff. If the patient cannot be controlled or show very few signs of cooling down at all, intramuscular (IM) drugs are a must. Drugs like midazolam, droperidol or olanzapine are best options. But none of these drugs are without potential side effects and thats why IM benztropine is a handy antidote at all times. In case of alcoholic delirium IM thiamine is most beneficial and can be given first hand with the other IM drugs. Treating a delirious, aggressive patient is a challenge indeed. Without proper training, teamwork and technical know how, one aggressive patient can end up hurting not only himself, but also his relatives and medical staff. Hospitals in our country are poorly equipped to deal with such sensitive patients and must therefore be more vigilant in helping them with tact, delicacy and firmness.

When she hits the bottle...,"Today, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.",Tribune News Service,2016-07-31T00:58:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"Linda ChhakchhuakToday, globally India shows the third largest increase in alcohol consumption in the last 20 years, up by 52 per cent. In 2012-13, the India Centre for Alcohol Studies (INCAS), a government research body, had predicted that alcohol consumption among women in the country would grow by 25 per cent in the next five years, higher by 15 per cent than the overall rise projected for the industry.Among the key reasons for this exponential rise in alcohol consumption, particularly among urban upwardly-mobile women, is the misplaced notion that they are â€˜coolâ€™ and â€˜liberatedâ€™ if they raise a glass. Whereas having the freedom to choose and breaking gender stereotypes are vital for women's agency, this need not necessarily extend to asserting the â€˜right to consume alcoholâ€™. Of course, predictably, liquor manufacturers have latched on to this popular perception of 'liberated womanhood' and they are not just launching but also aggressively marketing new variants of alcoholic drinks targeted specifically at women. Indeed, leading brands are not hesitant to concede that their markets have expanded, thanks largely to this growing trend.Unfortunately, the â€˜good timesâ€™ only lead to not-so-good-times for many who start off as recreational drinkers but soon become habitual. As is the case with addicts around the world, according to Alcoholic Anonymous India (AA-I), women here, too, find it difficult to say, â€œI am an alcoholicâ€�, words, they believe, are the first step towards dealing with this addiction. In the north-eastern states, while it's easy for women to buy a drink, it's difficult for them to find a de-addiction facility that caters to their needs. In fact, gender bias rears its ugly head even here, as families are ready to go all out to help a son but are only too eager to ignore, deny or hide a daughter's problem.Recently, in a first for the Northeast region, the AA-I set up the Shillong Women's Fellowship, a platform for women who want to give up their addiction. At the launch of this critical service, Father Joseph H. Pereira, founder of Kripa Foundation, which offers rehabilitation to those affected by chemical dependency and HIV/AIDS, emphasised that â€œalcoholism is a disease and not a sin to be condemnedâ€�. He observed, â€œThere are so many people who are afflicted with this disease and many have succumbed to it. Yet, the shame and negative stereotype associated with this condition doesn't allow people to come forward and deal with their addiction.â€�For women battling chemical dependency, a term often used interchangeably with substance abuse, even admitting to addition is difficult, let alone confronting it. Sister Rose Paite, a member of the General Service Board (GSB) of the AA-I, who has worked on the issue of sobriety for women for the last 13-odd years, explained that the situation in the north-east states is dire because women, and the society at large, is in a state of denial.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Calling alcoholism a â€œhidden epidemicâ€�, she fervently wished their efforts would soon question this dangerous status quo. Sister Paite is the convenor of the movement for helping Women in Recovery for Sobriety that hopes to encourage the creation of similar AA-I fellowships for women across the region.Both Father Pereira and Sister Paite strongly recommended the need for a â€œholistic methodâ€� like the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) method, which is based on a 12-step programme, as there was no â€œchemical solution for chemical dependencyâ€�. â€œThe medical model has totally failed. There is nothing more powerful than the AA method,â€� they asserted, adding that if one has gained sobriety, they must not keep it to themselves but share the experience with others.As it is, the odds are stacked against women, be it socially or medically. Said Sister Paite, â€œParents would like to spend much on sons, but when it comes to daughters, they say they do not have money.â€� Explaining the medical dimension, Dr Harsh Udawat, Chairman of the GSB of the AA-I, iterated that alcohol consumption was more risky for women than for men. â€œAlcoholism is a progressive disease and there is no real cure for it. As a doctor, I have seen innumerable cases and can definitely validate the fact that there is nothing really very good about alcohol. Naturally, it does come down to one's personal choice and there cannot be any denying that, but exercising caution is crucial when it comes to drinking. In any case, the death rate among alcohol dependent women is 50 per cent, which is 100 per cent higher than in men,â€� said the doctor, who is also a gastroenterologist in Jaipur, Rajasthan.Besides the experts, there were quite a few women from Mizoram and Delhi, who came forward to talk about their experiences and share their ideas on motivating those battling alcoholism to seek support. Stating that the programmes under AA â€œhad come to their rescueâ€�, they wanted many more to understand the value of the sisterhood they shared being part of an AA group. â€œAs an alcoholic, I felt that I was on the verge of dying,â€� related one, while another spoke of how she had â€œdecided to put my best foot forward to help othersâ€�.Â The woman, who led the group from Delhi, explained that there were 30 women associated with them, â€œall sober and recoveringâ€�, ready to talk about their experiences with their â€œsistersâ€�. For women from Mizoram and Meghalaya present at the meeting, it was â€œcatharticâ€� to come face-to-face with those who had benefited from the AA approach and hear them speak openly about addiction on a public platform.â€œClearly, without sustained medical and psychological intervention to deal with their problem, women alcoholics are setting themselves for a downfall,â€� cautioned Sister Paite. This disturbing reality motivated her to initiate the Shillong Women's Fellowship so that it's easier for women to come forward and seek a helping hand. â€œI want the women from the Northeast to fearlessly work on their sobriety issues,â€� she urged.

"Kicking the bottle, one day at a time",The picturesque resort along the gushing waters of the Beas at Manali provided the perfect backfor a cocktail party.,Pradeep Sharma,2015-06-21T01:57:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"The picturesque resort along the gushing waters of the Beas at Manali provided the perfect backdrop for a cocktail party. However, over 200 cheerful former alcoholics, a majority of them anytime drinkers, along with their families preferred to say â€œcheersâ€� over a glass of juice or a cup of coffee. The occasion was the 12th Convention of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), that was organised recently.The motley crowd of recovering alcoholics comprised businessmen, private sector executives, government servants and women professionals. Their transformation had not been sudden. It was the result of a programme of recovery of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a worldwide fellowship of recovering alcoholics which boasts of a membership of over 30 lakh with over 30,000 sober alcoholics in India alone.Kicking off one session after another with the prayer â€œGod grant us serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can and wisdom to know the differenceâ€�, various speakers narrated heart-rending stories and how they escaped from the deadly dragnet of alcoholism â€œone day at a timeâ€� through AAâ€™s 12-step recovery programme.â€œI have turned to fertiliser from garbage,â€� a participant, sober for nearly 20 years, summed up the transformation. Through AA, he came to realise that he was not a bad person but a sick person suffering from an incurable progressive disease called alcoholism.

Women are as much affected as men though women alcoholics face a far graver social stigma. Never once since my late teens did I think I would be able to remain sober for over a month. And, here I am, sober for a few years now. I am a miracle.Alcohol was once the solution for all my problems. It solved my insecurities, loneliness, anger, sense of not being good enough, being the odd one out everywhereâ€¦ a few drinks would make all these and so many other thoughts and feelings just disappear. I drank alone and I drank like no one else I knew. Slowly, long before I knew it, alcohol ceased to be my friend and my solution. I was drinking throughout the day and wishing death would come in one blow and end the suffering that life had become. It took me a decade to admit that maybe drinking and my life, being the hell it was, were interlinked!I couldnâ€™t ask anyone for help. Thatâ€™s for the weak, I felt. I still donâ€™t remember how I got to hear of AA. God alone knows how, one morning at around 3 am, I got online and noted down a helpline number of AA, got drunk and went to sleep. By now, I had no regular job, stayed with my parents and was unable to even make a sandwich for myself or my son, who was six years old then. I could not taste food, coordinate colours and my movements were awkward. With no choice at all, I declared to myself that I would go and check the drunkards who went to a meeting with a name like AA.By evening, I was on my knees begging my father to go into the rooms to see whether it was good enough for me. You see, I was dying slowly physically. Mentally and emotionally, I was already dead, but with every bit I had in me, I wanted to know whether the meeting of AA members was up to the mark! I was a woman. I was scared. But unbeknown to me, I had been blessed by the gift of desperation. My father scouted the room for me and came back with the Big Book (basic text of AA). The next day, I went to my first meeting and have never looked back. Being a woman doesnâ€™t stop me from heading to the meeting anywhere now. The members of AA accept me and care for me like my family.I do not want to ever live that hell I lived in. Going to the meetings, getting a sponsor (to do the AA programme) and learning to practice the AA principles in my day-to-day life is responsible for every good thing in my life today.Â Once I stopped drinking, I had my broken life to deal with and nothing to hide behind. I had to find another way to live. That new design of living came to me via my sponsor through the Big Book.Â I do not want to remember my last drink but I do remember that unbearable pain. I donâ€™t have that today. I donâ€™t wake up and have that big black hole in my soul anymore. Now, I lead a good, full life.Â Alcoholism brought me to my knees because it led me to the gates of hell and yet I couldnâ€™t stop drinking. Today I can. I have some tools, steps and some friends who actually like me. This programme gives me the opportunity to be the woman that God wants me to be.(The writer, whose identity remains anonymous going byÂ AAâ€™s policy, has been sober for a few years now)",{},"['alcohol', 'drinking', 'stop', 'kicking', 'help', 'life', 'day', 'bottle', 'getting', 'sober', 'alcoholics', 'aa']","However, the disease can be arrested â€œone day at a timeâ€� by attending meetings where the AA members share experiences, strength and hope.

"Legalise drugs, get rid of addiction","TWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline  â€œ81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010â€�.",Rajendra P Jindal,2017-08-07T00:19:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"Rajendra P JindalTWO different news, apparently unrelated, made it to the newspapers a fortnight or so back. The first of these appeared, possibly, in The Tribune, with the headline Â â€œ81 lakh lesser tobacco consumers since 2010â€�. The other news item appeared the very next day, and was titled ""Punjab Inspector held for drug trafficking"" The same evening, it was prominently splashed on all television channels. It continued to be followed in the media for the next couple of days until it was drowned by similar news.An ordinary reader may be excused for not seeing any relation between these two. But let us take them one by one. It may be news to most readers that tobacco (nicotine) is a drug too, albeit a legal one, in all the senses of the word that â€œdrugâ€� conveys. Until a few years ago, rich and powerful tobacco companies in the US, most of the medical researchers and doctors (the latter too on the payroll of tobacco companies) refused to admit that tobacco is a drug. It was contended that it is, at worst, a habit-forming substance only.Â With the help of PET and MRI scans, it has been conclusively proved that nicotine creates the same biochemical and molecular effects in the brain as any other drug such as cocaine and heroin and many other activities such as a kiss, a hug or a word of praise. This effect is known as elevation of a neurotransmitter substance (a chemical which carries messages from one micro part of the brain to the other) called â€œDopamineâ€�. The surge in the level of Dopamine produces a feeling of pleasure, at least initially.Â This effect is not common to the same degree in everybody; probably it is modified by a genetic factor. Therefore, whereas some people can ""take it and leave it"", others become addicted. Smoking or chewing tobacco is as addictive as any other drug and as difficult to get rid of. It gives the same sense of pleasure and the physical ill-effects are much more than any other drug. No other drug causes fatal cancers, heart and chest problems and many serious ailments.The interesting question that arises is: how were 81 lakh people able to give it up without even a single one ever being arrested or put into jail? No amount of tobacco was confiscated and no police officer or politician was ever accused of dealing with tobacco. One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited. Secondly, it is the education by various means and at various fora about the ill-effects of tobacco that has worked the miracle. In school and college textbooks, on radio and television as well as cigarette advertisement boards and even cigarette packets, ill-effects of smoking are prominently displayed. Most people seem to know that smoking causes the cancer of the lungs, even if they know nothing else. Therefore, compared to many more than those who have given up smoking are those who want to and are trying to give up smoking. Â (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });As far as the other news that a Punjab Police Sub-inspector was held for drug trafficking, nobody should have trouble believing that the episode is only the tip of the iceberg. A junior police officer cannot run a drug empire without the collusion of Â colleagues and seniors. In the run-up to the Punjab Assembly elections, the chiefs of at least two of the political parties declared that they will totally abolish the drug menace from Punjab within a month of coming to power. The one who is now the Chief Minister, sotto voce, scaled the peak of rhetoric and ignorance when he declared that â€œthe back of the drug trade has been brokenâ€�. As the subsequent events, including the news in discussion have revealed, the demon called drug trade is healthy and well, thank you. Are these leaders innocent, ignorant, naive or plain simpletons? The drug trade will persist as long as our approach to handling it remains archaic.For some unknown reason, in contrast to smoking and consumption of alcohol, consuming drugs has always been considered a character flaw, a criminal activity. The dopamine hypothesis has proved that drug addiction is a disorder of the brain no different from that caused by nicotine and alcohol. It is a mental illness of similar nature. The right place for a drug addict, therefore, is a hospital and not a prison and the way to deal with drugs is not to prohibit them but to legalise them just as it is in the case of tobacco and alcohol. Why are we so keen and insistent on prohibiting drugs and not tobacco and alcohol, while the latter two are more harmful? It obviously cannot be because we are a nation with knee-jerk puritanism. In that case, we would prohibit alcohol also. There are two reasons for the insistence on drug prohibition. The drug trade will exist as long as there is prohibition that generates exorbitant profits for the drug lords like our Sub-inspector and his seniors as well as politicians. Also, we inherently want to punish narco-trafficking, not eradicate it.Â However, the most novel reason for drug prohibition so far has been propounded by the American author Barbara Ehrenreich. She feels that we cling to prohibition for the same reason one clings to so many other self -destructive habits like nicotine, cocaine and heroin: because of the way it makes us feel â€” good and self righteous. If we surrender now, it will send the wrong message. Says she, â€œLegal drugs, even if heavily taxed and extensively regulated would no doubt be cheaper than illegal ones. This could mean more people sampling them out of curiosity. This danger has to be weighed against the insidious marketing dynamics of illegal drugs whose widely inflated prices compel the user to become a pusher and a recruiter of new usersâ€�.Â It is time to try a new approach to the drug problem. The people who want to use drugs know where to get them and no law has yet dissuaded people from using them. Legalise, regulate and tax drugs to the hilt. Take the money that would have gone towards preventive laws and spend it on education, healthcare and rehabilitation.Â A word about rehabilitation too. Dopamine-related research has shown that abstinence, if maintained, not only halts the physical and psychological damage wrought by drugs but also reverses it in large measure. A majority of the rehabilitation centres, mushrooming all over and uniformly lacking sufficient staff with enough expertise (psychiatrists and psychotherapists) and dedication (nurses and helpers), are worse than prisons. An addict needs long treatment, perhaps running into months. During this period, there are failures but their rate is no different from that for other chronic diseases. Nearly half the recovering addicts fail to maintain complete abstinence after a year, about the same proportion of patients with diabetes and hypertension who fail to comply with their medication regimens. Therefore, occasional relapse only means that more treatment is required, not that the addict be imprisoned. Alcoholic Anonymous and Narcotic Anonymous are the two organisations which probably have the highest cure rate because their members never refer to themselves as â€œcuredâ€�; they always call themselves â€œrecovering addictsâ€�. We could begin with a drug like marijuana and see how abolishing prohibition works. Then, we could move on to more drugs. Doesn't it sound like an idea that might catch on?The writer is a surgeon at the Guru Gobind Singh MedicalÂ College and Hospital, Faridkot",{},"['addiction', 'drug', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'trade', 'tobacco', 'smoking', 'rid', 'punjab', 'nicotine', 'legalise', 'reason', 'prohibition']","One reason is that unlike other drugs, tobacco was never prohibited.

Later that year, Mossack Fonseca ended its relationship with the companies.Zuma and representatives of the companies have rejected allegations of wrongdoing and claimed the oil deals are ""quite attractive"" to the DRC government.Also implicated is John Addo Kufuor, the eldest son of Ghana's former president John Agyekum Kufuor, who led the country from 2001 to 2009.A trained accountant, the younger Kufuor is said in the documents to have controlled a $75,000 bank account in Panama for his father and his mother that he ran through an offshore company. He did not respond to the ICIJ's requests for comment.The son of Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso also appears in the Mossack Fonseca files, in the 1990s.Denis Christel Sassou Nguesso is said to have approached Mossack Fonseca about setting up a company based in the British Virgin Islands, called Phoenix Best Finance, according to the French daily Le Monde, which is one of the media partners for the release of the documents.Sassou Nguesso told Le Monde he did not know the law firm and had no knowledge of Phoenix Best Finance.The documents were first obtained by German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung a year ago, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and involving more than 100 publications from nearly 80 countries. â€” Agencies",{},"['president', 'huge', 'leaders', 'fonseca', 'tax', 'panama', 'kufuor', 'zuma', 'outs', 'documents', 'leak', 'world', 'mossack', 'company', 'aides', 'putin', 'son', 'offshore', 'papers']","King of Saudi Arabia, actor Jackie Chan, footballer Lionel Messi on listParis, April 4A massive leak of 11.5 million tax documents has exposed the secret offshore dealings of aides to Russian president Vladimir Putin, world leaders and celebrities including Barcelona forward Lionel Messi.

Ronaldo gets Ballon dâ€™Or,PARIS:Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon dâ€™Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.,Tribune News Service,2016-12-14T02:03:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"PARIS, December 13Cristiano Ronaldo capped a remarkable year by claiming the fourth Ballon dâ€™Or award after leading Portugal to an emotional European Championship title and Real Madrid to a record-extending Champions League crown in 2016.Ronaldo is one short of the record tally of five awards won by Barcelonaâ€™s Argentina forward Lionel Messi, who was second with the pair having taken the first two spots since 2011.â€œFor me itâ€™s a great honour to receive my fourth golden ball. The emotion is like for the first one, itâ€™s a dream come true again. I never thought in my mind to win four times. Iâ€™m so happy,â€� said Ronaldo, who won the award in 2008, 2013 and 2014.â€œItâ€™s probably the best year of my career collectively, with Real Madrid and Portugal. Real are used to winning titles while Portugal had never won a major title so this (Euro 2016) title is special. I donâ€™t want to lack respect to the Champions League but the title with Portugal is a level above.â€�Â The Ballon dâ€™Or, which merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year award from 2010-15 to create the FIFA Ballon dâ€™Or, returned to France Football magazine this year. A total of 173 journalists voted but not national team coaches and captains who were also polled for the FIFA award.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ });Cut aboveFrance and Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann, who lost to Ronaldoâ€™s Portugal and Real in the Euro 2016 and Champions League finals respectively, took third place. Uruguay forward Luis Suarez was fourth and Brazilâ€™s Neymar fifth, giving Barcelona three players in the top five.Ronaldo was a cut above the competition, though. He scored 51 goals in 54 games for club and country, albeit his lowest tally since 2008, claimed another Champions League winnersâ€™ medal and lifted the European Championship trophy. Ronaldo limped off midway through the first half of Julyâ€™s Euro 2016 final, which Portugal won 1-0 after extra time against hosts France, but he hobbled back onto the pitch to celebrate his countryâ€™s first major soccer title. Six weeks earlier, after a fairly anonymous performance against local rivals Atletico in the Champions League final, he scored the decisive penalty in the shootout to hand Real their 11th European Cup. It was, therefore, hard to see past 31-year-old Ronaldo for the winner of the Ballon dâ€™Or, even if the trophy is designed to reward individual performance rather than team results.Taxing questions spoil Ballon dâ€™Or winRonaldo feels unable to celebrate his fourth Ballon dâ€™Or award as much as his previous triumphs due to recent allegations of tax evasion. The European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) media consortium reported in early December that Ronaldo, and several other clients of soccer agency Gestifute, had used tax havens to handle tens of millions of euros in earnings. Gestifute denied the accusations last week. Ronaldo expressed his disappointment at the timing of the charges against him.â€œOf course it (allegations) has spoiled it a little bit. I would be lying if I said it hadnâ€™t. Iâ€™m not a hypocrite,â€� he said. â€œI wasnâ€™t pleased. The whole process in itself is hard and not only for me, but also for the people alongside me: my family, my son, all those who work with me. All that irritates me because I try to do things correctly, be transparent.â€�â€œI donâ€™t have any reason to lie. What came out troubles me. Because itâ€™s not true. The lie is troubling. I have done things correctly. There are a lot of innocent people in prison. And I feel a little bit like that. You know you have done nothing wrong, and they say you have done something reprehensible. No one likes that,â€� he added.Villarreal beat Atletico Madrid 3-0Â Villarreal thumped Atletico Madrid 3-0 to vault into the fourth place in La Liga, dropping them to sixth. Adding to Atleticoâ€™s misery, midfielder Tiago and goalkeeper Jan Oblak left the match in the first half with injuries. The hosts took a 1-0 lead in the 28th minute when Manu Trigueros took advantage of an error by Tiago and beat Oblak with an angled shot. Oblak set up the home sideâ€™s second goal with a poor clearance that ended up at the feet of Jonathan Dos Santos, who hit the post once before putting away his own rebound to make it 2-0 in the 38th minute. Roberto Soriano settled the matter with a third goal for the hosts in the stoppage time.

Redefining national security in complex new world,"In his avatar as a futurologist, Henry Kissinger in his thought-provoking book â€œWorld Orderâ€� draws a few conclusions relevant to Indiaâ€™s national security situation. Firstly, Kissinger notes that the world is spinning out of control with no designated caretaker.",Lt Gen SS Mehta (retd),2015-01-20T01:51:00,Tribuneindia News Service,"In his avatar as a futurologist, Henry Kissinger in his thought-provoking book â€œWorld Orderâ€� draws a few conclusions relevant to Indiaâ€™s national security situation. Firstly, Kissinger notes that the world is spinning out of control with no designated caretaker. Secondly, he predicts that India will be the fulcrum of the 21st century world order because of its cultural cohesiveness. Thirdly, he notes with his patented asperity that foreign policy cannot be held hostage to domestic policies. Lastly, he notes the dichotomy that while economic structures are rapidly globalising, political structures remain enslaved to the Westphalian nation-state construct which is becoming increasingly irrelevant.An explanation is warranted here. The Westphalia Treaty came about in 1648 after incessant war drove the degutted participating states to sign up for what was formalised as â€˜peace by exhaustionâ€™. It also led to the creation of a politico-strategic structure identified as the nation-state. Over 350 years later, the global knowledge explosion underscored by the ubiquitous, all-pervasive social media and IT-driven technology platforms providing instant, affordable communications and convergence has raised serious questions about the continued relevance of the Westphalian model.Â Upgrading Westphalian modelÂ Alvin Toffler got this phenomenon right in his â€œThird Waveâ€� analogy of the 1980s when he listed the everywhere (globalisation), nowhere (cyberspace), and out there (outer space) paradigm as the greatest turning point of the modern era. Driven by â€˜techno-rebelsâ€™, this Third Wave has given a new meaning to national security by underscoring the increasing ease and anonymity of asymmetric threats to it by state and non-state actors and the resultant challenges now faced by the citizen. Thus, it is fair to say that national security will increasingly signify the security of the nation and its citizenry.Â This emerging space-cyberspace-instant communication continuum has totally diluted the historic idea of nation-states with national boundaries. Under the new dispensation, the â€˜thingâ€™ to be protected more than national borders is the individual of that country. Failure to undergo this transformation will render the idea of national security irrelevant if it isnâ€™t configured as â€˜all-embracingâ€™. Thus, unless every citizen across gender, age, profession and religious persuasion feels to be an intrinsic part of the security â€˜ideaâ€™ of that nation, part of its national security spectrum, the concept will become unstuck.Â Thus far, national security always meant two things: Scanning the security environment for likely threats and placing the military hardware needed to counter the perceived security threads. The soft side was either ignored, or glossed over as a sufficiently essential component of national security. Wisdom has now dawned that national security is actually the sum total of national defence, economic security and human security. All three add up to lend new meaning and substance to what comprises national security.Â As far as economic security is concerned, former Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Dr Subir Gokarn pointed out that the Indian economy has displayed an inability to sustain high growth rates for long periods of time partly because it failed to deal with structural barriers on time. Left unattended, these barriers will emerge as serious existential threats to national security.Â Â While national defence is well understood, the mediums of conflict have enhanced. Besides the traditional dimensions of land, water, underwater and air, we now have space and cyberspace. While earlier threats were stand-alone, cyberspace has now networked all threats, adding exponential value to each. This has forced us to understand and use cyberspace for national security.Â In the domain of human security, India faces six threats: Water, energy, health, education not resulting in employment, environment and technology. This combination of traditional and non-traditional threats coupled with the availability of affordable and enhanced mediums of anonymous asymmetric capabilities has complicated the security scenario. To deal with this synergistically, there is a need to design a unique architecture which concentrates on policy direction and monitors implementation.Â New security architectureÂ On the architecture of the National Security Commission, we would be well advised not to go by the name. Whether it is the National Security Council, National Development Council or known by another name, it should have expertise to devise and articulate policy to suit the changed conditions and emerging challenges. Policy when clearly enunciated will provide the basis of a National Security Doctrine which, due to the rapidly changing environment, will always remain a work in progress. However, it will be the quality of available expertise and the design of the scaffolding, besides the wisdom to â€˜add onâ€™ or delete â€˜redundanciesâ€™, that will remain critical.While placing due emphasis on the contribution of citizens to be partners in national security, it is axiomatic that we make policies that enable India to transit from a â€˜labour arbitrage economyâ€™ to a â€˜knowledge arbitrage economyâ€™. If we do not make this transition, we will remain the patronisingly labelled low-end labour force of the world: A condition which emphasises the insecurity and low self-esteem of citizens. Whether we upgrade â€˜skillingâ€™ Â  using the â€˜Make-in-Indiaâ€™ or â€˜Made-for-Indiaâ€™ pathways or both, we will have to make this transition speedily empowered by well thought-out policies. Â Â On the nuclear front, we are still using the grammar and lexicon of the Cold War. We have to devise our own grammar and lexicon. For instance, I am not convinced why we are not in a position to say that â€˜threat of use is first useâ€™. Sure, this usage is debate-worthy because it has complex dimensions, but is still the operating part of the new lexicon we should be using.Â Â In the emerging understanding of statecraft, even seasoned campaigners like Kissinger have begun to see the wisdom of Kautilyaâ€™s â€œArthashastraâ€� formulations. He opines that the treatise represents practical statecraft, not philosophical constructs. Maybe it is time for us to reinterpret Kautilyaâ€™s teachings.Â Media and perception managementFinally, a word on the media â€” a key component of the national security architecture. While it has instant, mind-boggling information available to it, such access erodes perspectives and rapidly generates flawed perceptions. Often, and this happens cyclically on the TV media, while perception is at the goalpost, truth is still putting on its socks. That is where the print media remains compellingly relevant. This is because print provides a balanced perspective. Readers begin to understand the context of an occurrence that often results in a change of perceptions. However, the IT explosion has compressed time because even as the old story is being deciphered, another story or group of stories is breaking out. This reduces the importance of perception, leaving one notable causality: The truth.Â Â The printed word, however, has the advantage of ease of access and archival recall. It isnâ€™t a blip that comes and goes and will always be relevant. There is much more that goes into news gathering and its analysis and sifting of wheat fromÂ the chaff. The relevance of the print media cannot, therefore, be trivialised.Â Â Concluded",{},"['policy', 'media', 'remain', 'cyberspace', 'national', 'world', 'india', 'threats', 'wisdom', 'security', 'complex', 'redefining']","Thus, it is fair to say that national security will increasingly signify the security of the nation and its citizenry.
